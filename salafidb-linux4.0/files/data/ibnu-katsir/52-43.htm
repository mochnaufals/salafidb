Allah is the One Who created them and brought them into existence after they were nothing. Al-Bukhari recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, "I heard the Prophet recite Surat At-Tur in Al-Maghrib prayer and when he reached this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÎõáöŞõæÇú ãöäú ÛóíúÑö ÔóìúÁò Ãóãú åõãõ ÇáúÎóÜáöŞõæäó - Ãóãú ÎóáóŞõæÇú ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó Èóá áÇøó íõæŞöäõæäó - Ãóãú ÚöäÏóåõãú ÎóÒóÂÆöäõ ÑóÈøößó Ãóãú åõãõ ÇáúãõÓóíúØöÑõæäó </div><br>  (Or were they created by nothing Or were they themselves the creators Or did they create the heavens and the earth Nay, but they have no firm belief. Or are with them the treasures of your Lord Or are they the tyrants with the authority to do as they like), I felt my heart would fly away.'' This Hadith is collected in the Two Sahihs using various chains of narration. Jubayr bin Mut`im went to the Messenger of Allah after the battle of Badr to ransom the captured idolators. At that time, he was still an idolator. Hearing the Prophet recite this Ayah was one of the reasons that he later embraced Islam. Allah the Exalted said, o   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÎóáóŞõæÇú ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó Èóá áÇøó íõæŞöäõæäó </div><br>  (Or did they create the heavens and the earth Nay, but they have no firm belief.) meaning, Allah is censuring the idolators for their idolatry, while asking them if they created the heavens and earth. They knew that Allah Alone is the Creator without partners with Him. However, they fell into idolatry because they had no firm belief,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÚöäÏóåõãú ÎóÒóÂÆöäõ ÑóÈøößó Ãóãú åõãõ ÇáúãõÓóíúØöÑõæäó </div><br>  (Or are with them the treasures of your Lord Or are they the tyrants with the authority to do as they like) meanings, do they have the authority to do whatever they will in His kingdom Do they hold the keys to His treasures in their hands   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú åõãõ ÇáúãõÓóíúØöÑõæäó</div><br>  (or are they the tyrants with the authority to do as they like) meanings, are they the tyrants who would hold the creation to account Never, Allah the Exalted and Most Honored is the Only King and Owner of the existence and He does what He wills. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú áóåõãú Óõáøóãñ íóÓúÊóãöÚõæäó İöíåö</div><br>  (Or have they a stairway, by means of which they listen.) meaning, do they have a stairway to heaven (to the place where the angels are),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáúíóÃúÊö ãõÓúÊóãöÚõåõã ÈöÓõáúØóÜäò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (Then let their listener produce some manifest proof.) meaning, let their listener produce evidence to the truth of their actions and statements. They will never be able to do so and therefore, they have nothing and have no evidence for their stance. Allah admonishes them regarding their claim that He has daughters and that the angels are females! The pagans chose for themselves male offspring and preferred them instead of females, and when one of them would be brought the good news of a daughter being born, his face would turn dark on account of his suppressed anger! Yet, they made the angels Allah's daughters and worshipped them besides Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú áóåõ ÇáúÈóäóÜÊõ æóáóßõãõ ÇáúÈóäõæäó </div><br>  (Or has He only daughters and you have sons) Allah sends a strong warning and stern admonition to them in this Ayah and a sure promise. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÊóÓúÜóáõåõãú ÃóÌúÑÇğ</div><br>  (Or is it that you ask a wage from them) meaning, `as a remuneration for your preaching Allah's Message to them Nay, you, do not ask them for a wage,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåõã ãøöä ãøóÛúÑóãò ãøõËúŞóáõæäó</div><br>  (so that they are burdened with a load of debt), meaning, for in this situation, one will complain of the least bothersome thing and feel it difficult and burdensome for him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÚöäÏóåõãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈõ İóåõãú íóßúÊõÈõæäó </div><br>  (Or that the Unseen is with them, and they write it down) means, they do not have knowledge of the Unseen, for none in the heavens or earth knows the Unseen except Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú íõÑöíÏõæäó ßóíúÏÇğ İóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú åõãõ ÇáúãóßöíÏõæäó </div><br>  (Or do they intend a plot But those who disbelieve are themselves plotted against!) Allah the Exalted is asking, `Do these people who utter such statements about the Messenger and his religion seek to deceive the people and plot against the Messenger and his Companions If they do, then let them know that their plots will only harm them. Therefore, they are being plotted against rather than being the plotters!'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú áóåõãú ÅöáóÜåñ ÛóíúÑõ Çááøóåö ÓõÈúÍóÜäó Çááøóåö ÚóãøóÇ íõÔúÑößõæäó </div><br>  (Or have they a god other than Allah Glorified be Allah from all that they ascribe as partners (to Him).) This Ayah contains harsh refutation directed at the idolators for worshipping the idols and calling upon rivals along with Allah. Allah next glorifies His Most Honorable Self from what they ascribe to Him, their lies and idolatry,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓõÈúÍóÜäó Çááøóåö ÚóãøóÇ íõÔúÑößõæäó</div><br>  (Glorified be Allah from all that they ascribe as partners (to Him).)  </div></body></html>
