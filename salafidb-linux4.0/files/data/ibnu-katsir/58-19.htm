Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõĞóÈúĞóÈöíäó Èóíúäó Ğáößó áÇó Åöáóì åóÜÄõáÇÁö æóáÇó Åöáóì åóÜÄõáÇÁö æóãóä íõÖúáöáö Çááøóåõ İóáóä ÊóÌöÏó áóåõ ÓóÈöíáÇğ </div><br>  ((They are) swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those; and he whom Allah sends astray, you will not find for him a way.)(4:143) Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑó Åöáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóæóáøóæúÇú ŞóæúãÇğ ÛóÖöÈó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöã</div><br>  (Have you not seen those who take as friends a people upon whom is the wrath of Allah) referring to the Jews with whom the hypocrites were allies in secret. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ åõã ãøöäßõãú æóáÇó ãöäúåõãú</div><br>  (They are neither of you nor of them,) meaning, that these hypocrites are neither with the believers, nor with their allies the Jews,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÍúáöİõæäó Úóáóì ÇáúßóĞöÈö æóåõãú íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (and they swear to a lie while they know.) meaning, the hypocrites lie when they vow, knowing that they are lying, which is called the vow of Al-Ghamus. We seek refuge with Allah from their ways. When the hypocrites met the believers they said that they believed and when they went to the Messenger, they swore to him by Allah that they were believers. They knew that they were lying in their vow, and they knew that they did not declare their true creed. This is why Allah witnessed here that they lie in their vows and know that they are lying, even though their statement (about the Prophet being Allah's Prophet) is true in essence. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÚóÏøó Çááøóåõ áóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈÇğ ÔóÏöíÏÇğ Åöäøóåõãú ÓóÂÁó ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (Allah has prepared for them a severe torment. Evil indeed is that which they used to do.) meaning, Allah has prepared a painful torment for the hypocrites on account of their evil deeds, their aid and support of the disbelievers and their deceit and betrayal of the believers. The statement of Allah the Exalted,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÊøóÎóĞúæÇú ÃóíúãóÜäóåõãú ÌõäøóÉğ İóÕóÏøõæÇú Úóä ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (They have made their oaths a screen. Thus they hinder (others) from the path of Allah,) meaning, the hypocrites pretended to be believers and concealed disbelief under the shield of their false oaths. Many were unaware of their true stance and were thus deceived by their oaths. Because of this, some people were hindered from the Path of Allah   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ ãøõåöíäñ</div><br>  (so they shall have a humiliating torment.) meaning, as recompense for belittling the significance of swearing by the Mighty Name of Allah, while lying and concealing betrayal. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä ÊõÛúäöìó Úóäúåõãú Ãóãúæóáõåõãú æóáÇó ÃóæúáÜÏõåõã ãøöäó Çááøóåö ÔóíúÆğÇ</div><br>  (Their children and their wealth will avail them nothing against Allah.) meaning, none of their possessions can avert the affliction when it is sent their way,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæáóÜÆößó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáäøóÇÑö åõãú İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó</div><br>  (They will be the dwellers of the Fire to dwell therein forever.) Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÈúÚóËõåõãõ Çááøóåö ÌóãöíÚÇğ</div><br>  (On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together;) referring to the Day of Resurrection when He will gather them all together and leave none of them out,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíóÍúáöİõæäó áóåõ ßóãóÇ íóÍúáöİõæäó áóßõãú æóíóÍúÓóÈõæäó Ãóäøóåõãú Úóáóì ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (then they will swear to Him as they swear to you. And they think that they have something.) meaning, they will swear to Allah the Exalted and Most Honored that they were following the guidance and the correct path, just as they used to swear to the believers in this worldly life. Verily, those who live following on a certain path will most likely die while on it. Thus, they will be resurrected upon their path. The hypocrites will think that their vows will help them with Allah, just as they helped with the people, who were obliged to treat them as they pretended to be, Muslim. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÍúÓóÈõæäó Ãóäøóåõãú Úóáóì ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (And they think that they have something) meaning, on account of swearing to their Lord (that they used to be believers). Allah rebukes this idea of theirs;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇó Åöäøóåõãú åõãõ ÇáúßóÜĞöÈõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, they are liars!) stressing that they are lying, Allah then said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÓúÊóÍúæóĞó Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ İóÃóäÓóÜåõãú ĞößúÑó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (The Shaytan has overpowered them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allah.) meaning, Shaytan has taken over their hearts to the point that he made them forget Allah the Exalted and Most Honored. This is what the devil does to those whom he controls. Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Ad-Darda' said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú ËóáóÇËóÉò İöí ŞóÑúíóÉò æóáóÇ ÈóÏúæò¡ áóÇ ÊõŞóÇãõ İöíåöãõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉõ ÅöáøóÇ ŞóÏö ÇÓúÊóÍúæóĞó Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäõ¡ İóÚóáóíúßó ÈöÇáúÌóãóÇÚóÉö¡ İóÅöäøóãóÇ íóÃúßõáõ ÇáĞøöÆúÈõ ÇáúŞóÇÕöíóÉ»</div><br>  (Any three in a village or desert among whom the Salah is not called for, will have the Shaytan control them. Therefore, adhere to the Jama`ah, for the wolf eats from the strayed sheep.) Za'idah added that As-Sa'ib said that Jama`ah, refers to, "Praying in congregation.'' Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÍöÒúÈõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö</div><br>  (They are the party of Shaytan.) referring to those who are controlled by the devil and, as a result, forgot the remembrance of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇó Åöäøó ÍöÒúÈó ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö åõãõ ÇáÎóÜÓöÑõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, it is the party of Shaytan that will be the losers!)  </div></body></html>
