In the case of Fear prayer, Dhikr is encouraged even more because the pillars of the prayer are diminished since they move about while performing it, etc., unlike other prayers. Allah said about the Sacred Months,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóÙúáöãõæÇú İöíåöäøó ÃóäİõÓóßõãú</div><br>  (so wrong not yourselves therein), even though injustice is prohibited all year long. However, injustice is particularly outlawed during the Sacred Months due to their sanctity and honor. So Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ŞóÖóíúÊõãõ ÇáÕøóáóæÉó İóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú Çááøóåó ŞöíóÜãÇğ æóŞõÚõæÏÇğ æóÚóáóì ÌõäõæÈößõãú</div><br>  (When you have finished Salah, remember Allah standing, sitting down, and on your sides,) means, in all conditions,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ÇØúãóÃúäóäÊõãú İóÃóŞöíãõæÇú ÇáÕøóáóæÉó</div><br>  (But when you are free from danger perform the Salah.) when you are safe, tranquil and fear subsides,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóŞöíãõæÇú ÇáÕøóáóæÉó</div><br>  (perform the Salah) by performing it as you were commanded; fulfilling its obligations, with humbleness, completing the bowing and prostration positions etc. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáÕøóáóæÉó ßóÇäóÊú Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ßöÊóÜÈÇğ ãøóæúŞõæÊÇğ</div><br>  (Verily, the Salah is Kitaban on the believers at fixed hours.) means, enjoined, as Ibn `Abbas stated. Ibn `Abbas also said, "The prayer has a fixed time, just as the case with Hajj.'' Similar is reported from Mujahid, Salim bin `Abdullah, `Ali bin Al-Husayn, Muhammad bin `Ali, Al-Hasan, Muqatil. As-Suddi and `Atiyah Al-`Awfi. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Encouragement to Pursue the Enemy Despite Injuries</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóåöäõæÇú İöì ÇÈúÊöÛóÂÁö ÇáúŞóæúãö</div><br>  (And don't be weak in the pursuit of the enemy;) means, do not weaken your resolve in pursuit of your enemy. Rather, pursue them vigorously, fight them and be wary of them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊóßõæäõæÇú ÊóÃúáóãõæäó İóÅöäøóåõãú íóÃúáóãõæäó ßóãóÇ ÊóÃúáóãæäó</div><br>  (if you are suffering then surely they are suffering as you are suffering,) meaning, just as you suffer from injuries and death, the same happens to the enemy. In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä íóãúÓóÓúßõãú ŞóÑúÍñ İóŞóÏú ãóÓøó ÇáúŞóæúãó ŞóÑúÍñ ãøöËúáõåõ</div><br>  (If you suffer a harm, be sure a similar harm has struck the others). Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑúÌõæäó ãöäó Çááøóåö ãóÇ áÇó íóÑúÌõæäó</div><br>  (but you have a hope from Allah that for which they hope not;) meaning, you and they are equal regarding the injuries and pain that you suffer from. However, you hope for Allah's reward, victory and aid, just as He has promised you in His Book and by the words of his Messenger . Surely, Allah's promise is true. On the other hand, your enemies do not have hope for any of this. So, it is you, not they, who should be eager to fight so that you establish the Word of Allah and raise it high. i   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÚóáöíãÇğ ÍóßöíãÇğ</div><br>  (And Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.) means, He is most knowledgeable and wise in all what He decides, decrees, wills and acts on concerning various worldly and religious ordainments, and He is worthy of praise in all conditions.  </div></body></html>
