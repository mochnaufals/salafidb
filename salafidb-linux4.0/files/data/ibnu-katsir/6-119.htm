It is understood from it that He has not allowed that over which Allah's Name was not mentioned when slaughtering. This was the practice of the pagans of Quraysh who used to eat dead animals and eat what was slaughtered for the idols. Allah next encourages eating from the meat of sacrificed animals on which His Name was mentioned upon slaughtering,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ áóßõãú ÃóáÇøó ÊóÃúßõáõæÇú ãöãøóÇ ĞõßöÑó ÇÓúãõ Çááøóåö Úóáóíúåö æóŞóÏú İóÕøóáó áóßõã ãøóÇ ÍóÑøóãó Úóáóíúßõãú</div><br>  (And why should you not eat of that on which Allah's Name has been mentioned, while He has explained to you what is forbidden to you...) meaning, He has explained and made clear to you what He has prohibited for you in detail,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ÇÖúØõÑöÑúÊõãú Åöáóíúåö</div><br>  (except under compulsion of necessity.)
