Al-Miqdad came to the Prophet while he was invoking Allah against the idolators and proclaimed, `We will not say as the people of Musa said, "So go you and your Lord and fight you two.''  Rather, we will fight to your right, to your left, before you and behind you.' I saw the Prophet's face beaming with pleasure because of what Al-Miqdad said to him.'' Al-Bukhari next narrated from Ibn `Abbas that on the day of Badr, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó ÃóäúÔõÏõßó ÚóåúÏóßó æóæóÚúÏóßó¡ Çááøóåõãøó Åöäú ÔöÆúÊó áóãú ÊõÚúÈóÏ»</div><br>  (O Allah! I invoke You for Your covenant and promise (victory). O Allah! If You decide so (cause our defeat), You will not be worshipped.)  Abu Bakr held the Prophet's hand and said, "Enough.'' The Prophet went out proclaiming,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóíõåúÒóãõ ÇáúÌóãúÚõ æóíõæóáøõæäó ÇáÏøõÈõÑ»</div><br>  (Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs.)  An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÃóáúİò ãøöäó ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö ãõÑúÏöİöíäó</div><br>  (with a thousand of the angels Murdifin) means, they follow each other in succession, according to Harun bin Hubayrah who narrated this from Ibn `Abbas about,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÑúÏöİöíäó</div><br>  (Murdifin), meaning each behind the other in succession. `Ali bin Abi Talhah Al-Walibi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "Allah supported His Prophet and the believers with a thousand angels, five hundred under the leadership of Jibril on one side and five hundred under the leadership of Mika'il on another side.'' Imams Abu Ja`far bin Jarir At-Tabari and Muslim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that `Umar said, "While a Muslim man was pursuing an idolator (during the battle of Badr), he heard the sound of a whip above him and a rider saying, `Come, O Hayzum!' Then he looked at the idolator, who fell to the ground. When he investigated, he found that the idolator's nose had wound and his face torn apart, just as if he received a strike from a whip on it, and the entire face had turned green. The Ansari man came to the Messenger of Allah and told him what had happened and the Messenger replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÕóÏóŞúÊó¡ Ğóáößó ãöäú ãóÏóÏö ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö ÇáËøóÇáöËóÉ»</div><br>  (You have said the truth, that was from the reinforcements from the third heaven.)  The Muslims killed seventy (pagans) in that battle and captured another seventy.  Al-Bukhari also wrote a chapter in his Sahih about the participation of the angels in Badr. He collected a Hadith from Rifa`h bin Rafi `Az-Zuraqi, who participated in Badr, Jibril came to the Prophet and asked him, "How honored are those who participated in Badr among you'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãöäú ÃóİúÖóáö ÇáúãõÓúáöãöíä»</div><br>  (Among the best Muslims.) Jibril said, "This is the case with the angels who participated in Badr.'' Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith. At-Tabarani also collected it in Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir, but from Rafi` bin Khadij, which is an apparent mistake. The correct narration is from Rifa`h, as Al-Bukhari recorded it. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said to `Umar, when `Umar suggested that the Prophet have Hatib bin Abi Balta`ah executed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóåõ ŞóÏú ÔóåöÏó ÈóÏúÑğÇ æóãóÇ íõÏúÑöíßó áóÚóáøó Çááåó ŞóÏö ÇØøóáóÚó Úóáóì Ãóåúáö ÈóÏúÑò İóŞóÇáó: ÇÚúãóáõæÇ ãóÇ ÔöÆúÊõãú İóŞóÏú ÛóİóÑúÊõ áóßõã»</div><br>  (He Hatib participated in Badr. How do you know that Allah has not looked at the people of Badr and proclaimed, `Do whatever you want, for I have forgiven you.')  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÌóÚóáóåõ Çááøóåõ ÅöáÇøó ÈõÔúÑóì</div><br>  (Allah made it only as glad tidings. ..)

Surely, Allah is able to give you (O Muslims) victory over your enemies, and victory only comes from Him, without need to send the angels,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÇáäøóÕúÑõ ÅöáÇøó ãöäú ÚöäÏö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And there is no victory except from Allah.)

Thus, but if it had been Allah's will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others. But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost. He will guide them and set right their state. And admit them to Paradise which He has made known to them.) 47:4-6  and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä íóãúÓóÓúßõãú ŞóÑúÍñ İóŞóÏú ãóÓøó ÇáúŞóæúãó ŞóÑúÍñ ãøöËúáõåõ æóÊöáúßó ÇáÇøñíøóÇãõ äõÏóÇæöáõåóÇ Èóíúäó ÇáäøóÇÓö æóáöíóÚúáóãó Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóíóÊøóÎöĞó ãöäßõãú ÔõåóÏóÂÁó æóÇááøóåõ áÇó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó - æóáöíõãóÍøöÕó Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóíóãúÍóŞó ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And so are the days (good and not so good), that We give to men by turns, that Allah may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. And Allah likes not the wrongdoers. And that Allah may test (or purify) the believers (from sins) and destroy the disbelievers.) 3:140-141  These are points of wisdom for which Allah has legislated performing Jihad, by the hands of the believers against the disbelievers. Allah used to destroy the previous nations that denied the Prophets, using various disasters that encompassed these rebellious nations. For instance, Allah destroyed the people of Nuh with the flood, `Ad with the wind, Thamud with the scream, the people of Lut with an earthquake and the people of Shu`ayb by the Day of the Shadow. After Allah sent Musa and destroyed his enemy Fir`awn and his soldiers by drowning, He sent down the Tawrah to him in which He legislated fighting against the disbelievers, and this legislation remained in the successive Laws. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÁóÇÊóíúäóÇ ãõæÓóì ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÂ ÃóåúáóßúäóÇ ÇáúŞõÑõæäó ÇáÇøòæáóì ÈóÕóÂÆöÑó</div><br>  (And indeed We gave Musa -- after We had destroyed the generations of old -- the Scripture as an enlightenment. ) 28:43  It is more humiliating for the disbeliever and more comforting to the hearts of the faithful that the believers kill the disbelievers by their own hands. Allah said to the believers of this Ummah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÜÊöáõæåõãú íõÚóĞøöÈúåõãõ Çááøóåõ ÈöÃóíúÏöíßõãú æóíõÎúÒöåöãú æóíóäúÕõÑúßõãú Úóáóíúåöãú æóíóÔúİö ÕõÏõæÑó Şóæúãò ãøõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your hands, and disgrace them, and give you victory over them, and heal the breasts of a believing people.)9:14  This is why killing the disbelievers of Quraysh by the hand of their enemies, whom they used to despise, was more humiliating to the disbelievers and comforting to the hearts of the party of faith. Abu Jahl, for instance, was killed in battle and this was more humiliating for him than dying in his bed, or from lightening, wind, or similar afflictions. Also, Abu Lahab died from a terrible disease that caused him to stink and none of his relatives could bear approaching him. They had to wash him with water by sprinkling it from a distance, then threw stones over his corpse, until it was buried under them! Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøó Çááøóåó ÚóÒöíÒñ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah is All-Mighty,), the might is His, His Messengers and the believers, both in this life and the Hereafter.
