Say: "He is Allah, One.'') (2. "Allah As-Samad.'') (3. "He begets not, nor was He begotten.'') (4. "And there is none comparable to Him.'') The reason for the revelation of this Surah has already been mentioned. `Ikrimah said, "When the Jews said, `We worship `Uzayr, the son of Allah,' and the Christians said, `We worship the Messiah (`Isa), the son of Allah,' and the Zoroastrians said, `We worship the sun and the moon,' and the idolators said, `We worship idols,' Allah revealed to His Messenger ,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ёхбъ ехжу «ббшуех √уЌуѕс </div><br>  (Say: "He is Allah, One.'') meaning, He is the One, the Singular, Who has no peer, no assistant, no rival, no equal and none comparable to Him. This word (Al-Ahad) cannot be used for anyone in affirmation except Allah the Mighty and Majestic, because He is perfect in all of His attributes and actions. Concerning His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ббшуех «б’шугуѕх </div><br>  (Allah As-Samad.) `Ikrimah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "This means the One Who all of the creation depends upon for their needs and their requests.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, "He is the Master Who is perfect in His sovereignty, the Most Noble Who is perfect in His nobility, the Most Magnificent Who is perfect in His magnificence, the Most Forbearing Who is perfect in His forbearance, the All-Knowing Who is perfect in His knowledge, and the Most Wise Who is perfect in His wisdom. He is the One Who is perfect in all aspects of nobility and authority. He is Allah, glory be unto Him. These attributes are not befitting anyone other than Him. He has no coequal and nothing is like Him. Glory be to Allah, the One, the Irresistible.'' Al-A`mash reported from Shaqiq, who said that Abu Wa'il said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«б’шугуѕх</div><br>  (As-Samad.) is the Master Whose control is complete.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah is Above having Children and procreating</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>бугъ нубцѕъ жубугъ нхжбуѕъ - жубугъ нуяхдъ бшуех яхЁхж«р √уЌуѕс </div><br>  (He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is none comparable to Him.) meaning, He does not have any child, parent or spouse. Mujahid said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жубугъ нуяхдъ бшуех яхЁхж«р √уЌуѕс </div><br>  (And there is none comparable to Him.) "This means He does not have a spouse.''

How can He have children when He has no wife He created all things.) (6:101) meaning, He owns everything and He created everything. So how can He have a peer among His creatures who can be equal to Him, or a relative who can resemble Him Glorified, Exalted and far removed is Allah from such a thing.

Indeed you have brought forth (said) a terrible evil thing. Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins, that they ascribe a son to Ar-Rahman. But it is not suitable for Ar-Rahman that He should beget a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto Ar-Rahman as a slave. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And all of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.)

Glorified is Allah! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him!) (37:158-159) In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded (that that the Prophet said),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ђбу« √уЌуѕу √у’ъ»у—х Џубум √у–рм ”угцЏуех гцду «ббец° нућъЏубхжду буех жубуѕр«° жуехжу ну—ъ“хёхехгъ жунхЏу«Ёцнецгї</div><br>  (There is no one more patient with something harmful that he hears than Allah. They attribute a son to Him, while it is He Who gives them sustenance and cures them.) Al-Bukhari also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ђёу«бу «ббех Џу“шу жућубшу: яу–шу»удцн «»ъдх ¬ѕугу жубугъ нуяхдъ буех –убцяу° жу‘у угудцн жубугъ нуяхдъ буех –убцяу° Ёу√угшу«  уяъ–цн»хех ≈цншу«ну Ёуёужъбхех: будъ нхЏцнѕудцн яугу« »уѕу√удцн° жубунъ”у √ужшубх «бъќубъёц »ц√уеъжуду Џубуншу гцдъ ≈цЏу«ѕу цец° жу√угшу« ‘у ъгхех ≈цншу«ну Ёуёужъбхех: « шуќу–у «ббех жубуѕр«° жу√уду« «бъ√уЌуѕх «б’шугуѕх° бугъ √убцѕъ жубугъ √хжбуѕъ° жубугъ нуяхдъ бцн яхЁхжр« √уЌуѕї</div><br>  (Allah the Mighty and Majestic says, "The Son of Adam denies Me and he has no right to do so, and he abuses Me and he has no right to do so. In reference to his denial of Me, it is his saying: `He (Allah) will never re-create me like He created me before.' But the re-creation of him is easier than his original creation. As for his cursing Me, it is his saying: `Allah has taken a son.' But I am the One, the Self-Sufficient Master. I do not give birth, nor was I born, and there is none comparable to Me.'')
