Allah commanded His Messenger Muhammad to recite this story to his Ummah so that they could follow this example of sincerity towards Allah, putting one's trust in Him, worshipping Him Alone with no partner or associate, and renouncing Shirk and its people. Allah granted guidance to Ibrahim before, i.e., from a very early age he had denounced his people's practice of worshipping idols with Allah, may He be exalted.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ŞóÇáó áÇøğÈöíåö æóŞóæúãöåö ãóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó </div><br>  (When he said to his father and his people: "What do you worship'') meaning: what are these statues to which you are so devoted   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú äóÚúÈõÏõ ÃóÕúäóÇãÇğ İóäóÙóáøõ áóåóÇ ÚóÜßöİöíäó </div><br>  (They said: "We worship idols, and to them we are ever devoted.'') meaning: we are devoted to worshipping them and praying to them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó åóáú íóÓúãóÚõæäóßõãú ÅöĞú ÊóÏúÚõæäó - Ãóæú íóäİóÚõæäóßõãú Ãóæú íóÖõÑøõæäó - ŞóÇáõæÇú Èóáú æóÌóÏúäóÂ ÁóÇÈóÂÁóäóÇ ßóĞóáößó íóİúÚóáõæäó </div><br>  (He said: "Do they hear you when you call Or do they benefit you or do they cause harm'' They said: "(Nay) but we found our fathers doing so.'') They knew that their idols could not do anything, but they had seen their fathers doing this, so they made haste to follow in their footsteps. So Ibrahim said to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÃóİóÑóÁóíúÊõãú ãøóÇ ßõäúÊõãú ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó - ÃóäÊõãú æóÁóÇÈóÂÄõßõãõ ÇáÇøñŞúÏóãõæäó - İóÅöäøóåõãú ÚóÏõæøñ áöì ÅöáÇøó ÑóÈøó ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (Do you observe that which you have been worshipping --you and your ancient fathers Verily, they are enemies to me, save the Lord of Al-`Alamin.) meaning, `if these idols mean anything and have any influence, then let them do me any kind of harm, for I am an enemy to them and I do not care about them or think anything of them.' This is akin to the way Allah described Nuh:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÌúãöÚõæÇú ÃóãúÑóßõãú æóÔõÑóßóÂÁóßõãú</div><br>  (So devise your plot, you and your partners) (10:71).

Verily, my Lord is on the straight path) (11:54-56). rSimilarly, Ibrahim denounced their gods and idols and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóíúİó ÃóÎóÇİõ ãóÂ ÃóÔúÑóßúÊõãú æóáÇó ÊóÎóÇİõæäó Ãóäøóßõãú ÃóÔúÑóßúÊõã ÈöÇááøóåö</div><br>  (And how should I fear those whom you associate in worship with Allah, while you fear not that you have joined in worship with Allah) (6:81).
