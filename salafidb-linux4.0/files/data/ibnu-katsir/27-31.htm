Sulayman wrote a letter to Bilqis and her people and gave it to the hoopoe to deliver. It was said that he carried it on his wings, as is the way with birds, or that he carried it in his beak. He went to their land and found the palace of Bilqis, then he went to her private chambers and threw the letter through a small window, then he stepped to one side out of good manners. Bilqis was amazed and confused when she saw that, then she went and picked up the letter, opened its seal and read it. The letter said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ãöä ÓõáóíúãóÇäó æóÅöäøóåõ ÈöÓúãö Çááøóåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö - ÃóáÇøó ÊóÚúáõæÇú Úóáóìøó æóÃúÊõæäöì ãõÓúáöãöíäó </div><br>  (it is from Sulayman, and it (reads): `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful; Be you not exalted against me, but come to me submitting (as Muslims).') So she gathered her commanders and ministers and the leaders of her land, and said to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúãóáÃõ Åöäøóì ÃõáúŞöìó Åöáóìøó ßöÊóÇÈñ ßóÑöíãñ</div><br>  ("O chiefs! Verily, here is delivered to me a noble letter.'') She described it as such because of the wondrous things she had seen, that it was delivered by a bird who threw it to her, then stood aside out of good manners. This was something that no king could do. Then she read the letter to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ãöä ÓõáóíúãóÇäó æóÅöäøóåõ ÈöÓúãö Çááøóåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö - ÃóáÇøó ÊóÚúáõæÇú Úóáóìøó æóÃúÊõæäöì ãõÓúáöãöíäó </div><br>  (Verily, it is from Sulayman, and it (reads): `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful; Be you not exalted against me, but come to me submitting (as Muslims).') Thus they knew that it was from Allah's Prophet Sulayman, upon him be peace, and that they could not match him.
