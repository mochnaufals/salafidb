Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due; and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice. Verily, how excellent is the teaching which He (Allah) gives you! Truly, Allah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to Return the Trusts to Whomever They Are Due</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah commands that the trusts be returned to their rightful owners. Al-Hasan narrated that Samurah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÏøö ÇáúÃóãóÇäóÉó Åöáì ãóäö ÇÆúÊóãóäóßó¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÎõäú ãóäú ÎóÇäóß»</div><br>  (Return the trust to those who entrusted you, and do not betray those who betrayed you.) Imam Ahmad and the collectors of Sunan recorded this Hadith. This command refers to all things that one is expected to look after, such as Allah's rights on His servants: praying, Zakah, fasting, penalties for sins, vows and so forth. The command also includes the rights of the servants on each other, such as what they entrust each other with, including the cases that are not recorded or documented. Allah commands that all types of trusts be fulfillled. Those who do not implement this command in this life, it will be extracted from them on the Day of Resurrection. It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÊõÄóÏøóäøó ÇáúÍõŞõæŞõ Åöáì ÃóåúáöåóÇ ÍóÊøóì íõŞúÊóÕøó áöáÔøóÇÉö ÇáúÌóãøóÇÁö ãöäó ÇáúŞóÑúäóÇÁ»</div><br>  (The rights will be rendered back to those to whom they are due, and even the sheep that does not have horns will take revenge from the horned sheep.) Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Jurayj said about this Ayah, "It was revealed concerning `Uthman bin Talhah from whom the Messenger of Allah took the key of the Ka`bah and entered it on the Day of the victory of Makkah. When the Prophet went out, he was reciting this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóÃúãõÑõßõãú Ãóä ÊõÄÏøõæÇú ÇáÇÍóãóÜäóÜÊö Åöáóì ÃóåúáöåóÇ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due). He then called `Uthman and gave the key back to him.'' Ibn Jarir also narrated that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "When the Messenger of Allah went out of the Ka`bah, he was reciting this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóÃúãõÑõßõãú Ãóä ÊõÄÏøõæÇú ÇáÇÍóãóÜäóÜÊö Åöáóì ÃóåúáöåóÇ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due). May I sacrifice my father and mother for him, I never heard him recite this Ayah before that.'' It is popular that this is the reason behind revealing the Ayah (4:58). Yet, the application of the Ayah is general, and this is why Ibn `Abbas and Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah said, "This Ayah is for the righteous and wicked,'' meaning it is a command that encompasses everyone. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Order to Be Just</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÍóßóãúÊõãú Èóíúäó ÇáäøóÇÓö Ãóä ÊóÍúßõãõæÇú ÈöÇáúÚóÏúáö</div><br>  (and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice.) commanding justice when judging between people. Muhammad bin Ka`b, Zayd bin Aslam and Shahr bin Hawshab said; "This Ayah was revealed about those in authority'', meaning those who judge between people. A Hadith states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ãóÚó ÇáúÍóÇßöãö ãóÇ áóãú íóÌõÑú¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÇÑó æóßóáóåõ Çááåõ Åöáì äóİúÓöå»</div><br>  (Allah is with the judge as long as he does not commit injustice, for when he does, Allah will make him reliant on himself.) A statement goes, "One day of justice equals forty years of worship.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó äöÚöãøóÇ íóÚöÙõßõãú Èöåö</div><br>  (Verily, how excellent is the teaching which He (Allah) gives you!) meaning, His commands to return the trusts to their owners, to judge between people with justice, and all of His complete, perfect and great commandments and laws. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ßóÇäó ÓóãöíÚÇğ ÈóÕöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (Truly, Allah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer.) means, He hears your statements and knows your actions.  </div></body></html>
