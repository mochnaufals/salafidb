So Allah, seized him with punishment for his last and first transgression. Verily, in this is an instructive admonition for whosoever fears Allah.) (79:23-26) meaning: he brought his people together and called to them in a loud voice, shouting that, and they responded to him obediently. So Allah took revenge on him, and made him a lesson to others in this world and the Hereafter. He even confronted Musa with that, and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÆöäö ÇÊøóÎóĞúÊó ÅöáóÜåóÇğ ÛóíúÑöì áÃóÌúÚóáóäøóßó ãöäó ÇáúãóÓúÌõæäöíäó</div><br>  (If you choose a god other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners) (26:29).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóæúŞöÏú áöì íóåóÜãóÜäõ Úóáóì ÇáØøöíäö İóÇÌúÚóá áøöì ÕóÑúÍÇğ áøóÚóáøöì ÃóØøóáöÚõ Åöáóì ÅöáóÜåö ãõæÓóì</div><br>  (So kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to bake (bricks out of) clay, and set up for me a Sarh in order that I may look at the God of Musa;) He commanded his minister and adviser Haman to bake bricks for him, i.e., to make bricks in order to build a Sarh, a exalted towering palace.

Build me a Sarh that I may arrive at the ways -- the ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the God of Musa, but verily, I think him to be a liar.'' Thus it was made fair seeming, in Fir`awn's eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the path; and the plot of Fir`awn led to nothing but loss and destruction) (40:36-37). Fir`awn built this tower, which was the highest structure ever seen on earth, because he wanted to show his people that Musa was lying when he claimed that there was a God other than Fir`awn. Fir`awn said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøöì áÃóÙõäøõåõ ãöäó ÇáúßóÜĞöÈöíäó</div><br>  (and verily, I think that he (Musa) is one of the liars.) meaning, `when he says that there is a lord other than me.' The issue was not whether Allah had sent Musa, because he did not acknowledge the existence of the Creator in the first place. On the contrary, he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (And what is the Lord of Al-`Alamin) (26:23) and:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÆöäö ÇÊøóÎóĞúÊó ÅöáóÜåóÇğ ÛóíúÑöì áÃóÌúÚóáóäøóßó ãöäó ÇáúãóÓúÌõæäöíäó</div><br>  (If you choose a god other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners.)
