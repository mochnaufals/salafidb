Revealer of the (Holy) Book, Mover of the clouds, and Defeater of the Confederates, defeat them and grant us victory over them.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command for Endurance when the Enemy Engaging</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah commands endurance upon meeting the enemy in battle and ordains patience while fighting them. Muslims are not allowed to run or shy away, or show cowardice in battle. They are commanded to remember Allah while in that condition and never neglect His remembrance. They should rather invoke Him for support, trust in Him and seek victory over their enemies from Him. They are required to obey Allah and His Messenger in such circumstances adhering to what He commanded them, and abstaining from what He forbade them. They are required to avoid disputing with each other, for this might lead to their defeat and failure,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóĞúåóÈó ÑöíÍõßõãú</div><br>  (lest your strength departs), so that your strength, endurance and courage do not depart from you,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÕúÈöÑõæÇú Åöäøó Çááøóåó ãóÚó ÇáÕøóÜÈöÑöíäó</div><br>  (and be patient. Surely, Allah is with the patients.)  In their courage, and obedience to Allah and His Messenger, the Companions reached a level never seen before by any nation or generation before them, or any nation that will ever come. Through the blessing of the Messenger and their obedience to what he commanded, the Companions were able to open the hearts, as well as, the various eastern and western parts of the world in a rather short time. This occurred even though they were few, compared to the armies of the various nations at that time. For example, the Romans, Persians, Turks, Slavs, Berbers, Ethiopians, Sudanese tribes, the Copts and the rest of the Children of Adam. They defeated all of these nations, until Allah's Word became the highest and His religion became dominant above all religions. The Islamic state spread over the eastern and western parts of the world in less than thirty years. May Allah grant them His pleasure, as well as, be pleased with them all, and may He gather us among them, for He is the Most Generous, and Giving.  </div></body></html>
