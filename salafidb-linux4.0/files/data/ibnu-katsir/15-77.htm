The discussion of As-Sijjil in Surah Hud is a sufficient explanation. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áÂíóÜÊò áöáúãõÊóæóÓøöãöíäó </div><br>  (Surely, in this are signs for those who see.) meaning that the traces of the destruction of that city are easily visible to any one who ponder about it, whether they look at it with physical eyesight or mental and spiritual insight, as Mujahid said concerning the phrase,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöáúãõÊóæóÓøöãöíäó</div><br>  (those who see) he said, "those who have insight and discernment.'' It was reported from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak that it referred to those who look. Qatadah said: "those who learn lessons''.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöáúãõÊóæóÓøöãöíäó</div><br>  (those who see) therefore the meaning is "those who ponder''. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The City of Sodom on the Highroad</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåóÇ áóÈöÓóÈöíáò ãøõŞöíãò </div><br>  (And verily, they were right on the highroad.) meaning that the city of Sodom, which was physically and spiritually turned upside down, and pelted with stones until it became a foul smelling lake (the Dead Sea), is on a route that is easily accessible until the present day. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóßõãú áøóÊóãõÑøõæäó Úóáóíúåöãú ãøõÕúÈöÍöíäó - æóÈöÇáøóíúáö ÃóİóáÇó ÊóÚúŞöáõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, you pass by them in the morning, and at night. Will you not then reflect) (37:137-138).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áÂíóÉğ áöáúãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (Surely, there is indeed a sign in that for the believers.) meaning, `All that We did to the people of Lut, from the destruction and the vengeance, to how We saved Lut and his family, these are clear signs to those who believe in Allah and His Messengers.'  </div></body></html>
