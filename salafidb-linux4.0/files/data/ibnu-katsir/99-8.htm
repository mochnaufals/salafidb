More than one of the Salaf have said this and it is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÇÊøóŞõæÇú ÑóÈøóßõãú Åöäøó ÒóáúÒóáóÉó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÔóìúÁñ ÚóÙöíãñ </div><br>  (O mankind!

(22:1) This is also similar to His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ãõÏøóÊú - æóÃóáúŞóÊú ãóÇ İöíåóÇ æóÊóÎóáøóÊú </div><br>  (And when the earth is stretched forth, and has cast out all that was in it and became empty.) (84:3-4) Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊõáúŞöí ÇáúÃóÑúÖõ ÃóİúáóÇĞó ßóÈöÏöåóÇ ÃóãúËóÇáó ÇáúÃõÓúØõæóÇäö ãöäó ÇáĞøóåóÈö æóÇáúİöÖøóÉö¡ İóíóÌöíÁõ ÇáúŞóÇÊöáõ İóíóŞõæáõ İöí åóĞóÇ ŞóÊóáúÊõ¡ æóíóÌöíÁõ ÇáúŞóÇØöÚõ İóíóŞõæáõ İöí åóĞóÇ ŞóØóÚúÊõ ÑóÍöãöí¡æóíóÌöíÁõ ÇáÓøóÇÑöŞõ İóíóŞõæáõ: İöí åóĞóÇ ŞõØöÚóÊú íóÏöí¡ Ëõãøó íóÏóÚõæäóåõ İóáóÇ íóÃúÎõĞõæäó ãöäúåõ ÔóíúÆğÇ»</div><br>  (The earth will throw out the pieces of its liver (its contents).

Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ ãóÇ áóåóÇ </div><br>  (And man will say: "What is the matter with it'') meaning, he will be baffled by its situation after it used to be stable, settled and firm, and he used to be settled upon its surface. This refers to the alteration of the state of things and the earth moving and shaking. There will come to it inescapable quaking that Allah prepared for it. Then it will throw out its dead people -- from the first to the last generations. At that time the people will be baffled by the events and the earth changing into other than the earth, and the heavens as well. Then they will be presented before Allah, the One, the Irresistible. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãóÆöĞò ÊõÍóÏøöËõ ÃóÎúÈóÇÑóåóÇ </div><br>  (That Day it will declare its information.) meaning, it will speak of what the people did upon its surface. Imam Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i all recorded a Hadith from Abu Hurayrah -- and in the wording of An-Nasa'i's version it states -- that he said, "The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãóÆöĞò ÊõÍóÏøöËõ ÃóÎúÈóÇÑóåóÇ </div><br>  (That Day it will declare its information.)

It will say that he did such and such on such and such day. So this is its information.)'' Then At-Tirmidhi said, "This Hadith is Sahih Gharib.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÃóäøó ÑóÈøóßó ÃóæúÍóì áóåóÇ </div><br>  (Because your Lord will inspire it.) It is apparent that the implied meaning here is that He will permit it (the earth).

"Its Lord will say to it, `Speak.' So it will speak.'' Mujahid commented (on "inspire it''), " He commands it (i.e., to speak). '' Al-Qurazi said, "He will command it to separate from them.'' Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãóÆöĞò íóÕúÏõÑõ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÃóÔúÊóÇÊÇğ</div><br>  (That Day mankind will proceed in scattered groups (Ashtat)) meaning, they will return from the station of the Judgement in separate groups. This means that they will be divided into types and categories: between those who are miserable and those who are happy, and those who are commanded to go to Paradise and those who are commanded to go to the Hellfire. As-Suddi said, "Ashtat means sects.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíõÑóæúÇú ÃóÚúãóÜáóåõãú</div><br>  (that they may be shown their deeds.) meaning, so that they may act and be rewarded for what they did in this life of good and evil. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Recompense for Every Minute Deed Therefore</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah goes on to say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä íóÚúãóáú ãöËúŞóÇáó ĞóÑøóÉò ÎóíúÑÇğ íóÑóåõ - æóãóä íóÚúÜãóáú ãöËúŞóÇáó ĞóÑøóÉò ÔóÑøÇğ íóÑóåõ </div><br>  (So whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it.

For one man they are a reward, for another man they are a shield, and for another man they are a burden. In reference to the man for whom they are a reward, he is the man who keeps them to be used in the way of Allah. Thus, they spend their entire life grazing in the pasture or garden (waiting in preparation for Jihad). So whatever afflicts them during that lengthy period in the pasture or garden, it will be counted as good deeds for him. Then, if their lengthy period is ended and they are used for a noble battle or two, their hoof prints and their dung are counted as good deeds for him.  When they passed through a stream from which they did drink, though he (their owner) does not intend to quench their thirst, yet, it would be counted as good deeds, Therefore, they are a reward for that man. A man who keeps them to maintain himself and to be independent of others (i.e., begging, etc.), and he does not forget the right of Allah upon their necks and their backs (i.e., their Zakah), then they are a shield for him (from the Hellfire). A man who keeps them in order to boast, brag and show off, then they are a burden for him (on Judgement Day).) So the Messenger of Allah was then asked about the donkeys and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÃóäúÒóáó Çááåõ İöíåóÇ ÔóíúÆğÇ ÅöáøóÇ åóĞöåö ÇáúÇíóÉó ÇáúİóÇĞøóÉó ÇáúÌóÇãöÚóÉó</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä íóÚúãóáú ãöËúŞóÇáó ĞóÑøóÉò ÎóíúÑÇğ íóÑóåõ - æóãóä íóÚúÜãóáú ãöËúŞóÇáó ĞóÑøóÉò ÔóÑøÇğ íóÑóåõ </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>»</div><br>  (Allah has not revealed anything concerning them except this single, comprehensive Ayah: (So whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of speck of dust shall see it.)) Muslim also recorded this Hadith. In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded from `Adi that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÊøóÜÜŞõæÇ ÇáäøóÇÑó æóáóæú ÈöÔöŞøö ÊóãúÑóÉò¡ æóáóæú ÈößóáöãóÉò ØóíøöÜÈóÉ»</div><br>  (Fear (ward off) the Fire, even if by giving half a date in charity, and even by saying a single word of good.) In the Sahih as well, he (`Adi) narrated (from the Prophet ):   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÍúŞöÑóäøó ãöäó ÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö ÔóíúÆğÇ æóáóæú Ãóäú ÊõİúÑöÛó ãöäú Ïóáúæößó İöí ÅöäóÇÁö ÇáúãõÓúÊóÓúŞöí¡ æóáóæú Ãóäú ÊóáúŞóì ÃóÎóÇßó æóæóÌúåõßó Åöáóíúåö ãõäúÜÈóÓöØ»</div><br>  (Do not under rate any good act, even if it is offering drinking water from your bucket to one who is seeking a drink, or meeting your brother with a cheerful face.) It is also recorded in the Sahih that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ãóÚúÔóÑó äöÓóÇÁö ÇáúãõÄúãöäóÇÊö¡ áóÇ ÊóÍúŞöÑóäøó ÌóÇÑóÉñ áöÌóÇÑóÊöåóÇ æóáóæú İöÑúÓóäó ÔóÇÉ»</div><br>  (O party of believing women! None of you should belittle a gift sent by your neighbor, even if it is a Firsan of a sheep.) The word Firsan in this Hadith means its hoof. In another Hadith he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑõÏøõæÇ ÇáÓøóÇÆöáó æóáóæú ÈöÙöáúİò ãõÍúÑóŞ»</div><br>  (Give something to the beggar, even if it is a burnt hoof.) It has been reported from `A'ishah that she gave a single grape in charity and then she said, "To how much dust is it equivelent'' Imam Ahmad recorded from `Awf bin Al-Harith bin At-Tufayl that `A'ishah told him that the Prophet used to say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇÚóÇÆöÔóÉõ¡ ÅöíøóÇßö æóãõÍóŞøóÑóÇÊö ÇáĞøõäõæÈö¡ İóÅöäøó áóåóÇ ãöäó Çááåö ØóÇáöÈğÇ»</div><br>  (O `A'ishah! Beware of the sins that are belittled, for indeed they will be taken account of by Allah.) This Hadith was recorded by An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah.Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöíøóÇßõãú æóãõÍóŞøóÑóÇÊö ÇáĞøõäõæÈö¡ İóÅöäøóåõäøó íóÌúÊóãöÚúäó Úóáóì ÇáÑøóÌõáö ÍóÊúì íõåúáößúäóå»</div><br>  (Beware of the sins that are belittled. For verily, they are gathered in a man until they destroy him.) And indeed the Messenger of Allah made an example of them (sins that are taken lightly) by saying that they are like a people who settle in barren land. Then their leader comes and orders the men to go out one at a time and each bring back a stick until they have gathered a large number of sticks. Then they kindled a fire and burned everything that they threw into it.This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Idha Zulzilat (Az-Zalzalah) and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
