Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏö ÇÎúÊóÑúäóÜåõãú Úóáóì Úöáúãò Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (And We chose them (the Children of Israel) over the `Alamin, (nations) with knowledge.)

Remember the favor of Allah to you: when He made Prophets among you, made you kings, honored you above the `Alamin (nations).'') (5:20).  Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi reported that Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that Abu Al-`Aliyah said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøöì İóÖøóáúÊõßõãú Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (and that I preferred you over the `Alamin) means, "The kingship, Messengers and Books that were granted to them, instead of granting such to the other kingdoms that existed during their time, for every period there is a nation.'' It was also reported that Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Qatadah and Isma`il bin Abi Khalid said similarly. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Ummah of Muhammad is Better than the Children of Israel</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  This is the only way the Ayah can be understood, because this Ummah is better than theirs, as Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõäÊõãú ÎóíúÑó ÃõãøóÉò ÃõÎúÑöÌóÊú áöáäøóÇÓö ÊóÃúãõÑõæäó ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö æóÊóäúåóæúäó Úóäö ÇáúãõäúßóÑö æóÊõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóáóæú ÁóÇãóäó Ãóåúáõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö áóßóÇäó ÎóíúÑÇğ áøóåõãú</div><br>  (You are the best of people ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin good and forbid evil, and you believe in Allah. And had the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) believed, it would have been better for them) (3:110).  Also, the Musnad and Sunan Collections of Hadith recorded that Mu`awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÊõãú Êõæóİøõæäó ÓóÈúÚöíäó ÃõãøóÉğ ÃóäúÊõãú ÎóíúÑõåóÇ æóÃóßúÑóãõåóÇ Úóáóì Çááå»</div><br>  (You (Muslims) are the seventieth nation, but you are the best and most honored of them according to Allah.)  There are many Hadiths on this subject, and they will be mentioned when we discuss Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõäÊõãú ÎóíúÑó ÃõãøóÉò ÃõÎúÑöÌóÊú áöáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (You are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind) (3:110).  </div></body></html>
