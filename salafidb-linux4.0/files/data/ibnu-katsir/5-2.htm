But when you finish the Ihram, then hunt, and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) lead you to transgression. Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa, but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And have Taqwa of Allah. Verily, Allah is severe in punishment.)  Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that a man came to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud and said to him, "Advise me.'' He said, "When you hear Allah's statement,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú</div><br>  (O you who believe!) then pay full attention, for it is a righteous matter that He is ordaining or an evil thing that He is forbidding.'' Khaythamah said, "Everything in the Qur'an that reads,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú</div><br>  (O you who believe!) reads in the Tawrah, `O you who are in need.''' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóæúİõæÇú ÈöÇáúÚõŞõæÏö</div><br>  (Fulfill (your) obligations.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others said that `obligations' here means treaties. Ibn Jarir mentioned that there is a consensus for this view. Ibn Jarir also said that it means treaties, such as the alliances that they used to conduct. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÃóæúİõæÇú ÈöÇáúÚõŞõæÏö</div><br>  (O you who believe! Fulfill (your) obligations.) "Refers to the covenants, meaning, what Allah permitted, prohibited, ordained and set limits for in the Qur'an. Therefore, do not commit treachery or break the covenants. Allah emphasized this command when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó íóäŞõÖõæäó ÚóåúÏó Çááøóåö ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãöíËóÜŞöåö æóíóŞúØóÚõæäó ãóÂ ÃóãóÑó Çááøóåõ Èöåö Ãóä íõæÕóáó</div><br>  (And those who break the covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined,) until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓõæÁõ ÇáÏøóÇÑö</div><br>  (unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell).)''

Ibn Jarir said that this Tafsir conforms to the meaning of (`beasts of cattle') that the Arabs had. We should mention that Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas and others relied on this Ayah as evidence to allow eating the meat of the fetus if it is found dead in the belly of its slaughtered mother. There is a Hadith to the same effect collected in the Sunan of Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and narrated by Abu Sa`id who said, "We asked, `O Messenger of Allah! When we slaughter a camel, cow or sheep, we sometimes find a fetus in its belly, should we discard it or eat its meat' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáõæåõ Åöäú ÔöÆúÊõãú İóÅöäøó ĞóßóÇÊóåõ ĞóßóÇÉõ Ãõãøöå»</div><br>  (Eat it if you want, because its slaughter was fulfilled when its mother was slaughtered.)'' At-Tirmidhi said, "This Hadith is Hasan.'' Abu Dawud recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ĞóßóÇÉõ ÇáúÌóäöíäö ĞóßóÇÉõ Ãõãøöå»</div><br>  (Proper slaughter of the fetus is fulfilled with the slaughter of its mother.) Only Abu Dawud collected this narration. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ íõÊúáóì Úóáóíúßõãú</div><br>  (except that which will be announced to you (herein), ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that it refers to, "The flesh of dead animals, blood and the meat of swine.'' Qatadah said, "The meat of dead animals and animals slaughtered without Allah's Name being pronounced at the time of slaughtering.'' It appears, and Allah knows best, that the Ayah refers to Allah's other statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍõÑøöãóÊú Úóáóíúßõãõ ÇáúãóíúÊóÉõ æóÇáúÏøóãõ æóáóÍúãõ ÇáúÎöäúÒöíÑö æóãóÂ Ãõåöáøó áöÛóíúÑö Çááøóåö Èöåö æóÇáúãõäúÎóäöŞóÉõ æóÇáúãóæúŞõæĞóÉõ æóÇáúãõÊóÑóÏøöíóÉõ æóÇáäøóØöíÍóÉõ æóãóÂ Ãóßóáó ÇáÓøóÈõÚõ</div><br>  (Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al-Maytah (the dead animals), blood, the flesh of swine, and what has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns - and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal.)5:3, for although the animals mentioned in this Ayah are types of permissible cattle (except for swine), they become impermissible under the circumstances that the Ayah 5:3 specifies. This is why Allah said afterwards,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ĞóßøóíúÊõãú æóãóÇ ĞõÈöÍó Úóáóì ÇáäøõÕõÈö</div><br>  (Unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) and that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An-Nusub (stone altars)) as the latter type is not permissible, because it can no longer be slaughtered properly. Hence, Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõÍöáøóÊú áóßõãú ÈóåöíãóÉõ ÇáÇøñäúÚóÇãö ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ íõÊúáóì Úóáóíúßõãú</div><br>  (Lawful to you are all the beasts of cattle except that which will be announced to you, ) means, except the specific circumstances that prohibit some of these which will be announced to you. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÛóíúÑó ãõÍöáøöì ÇáÕøóíúÏö æóÃóäÊõãú ÍõÑõãñ</div><br>  (game (also) being unlawful when you assume Ihram.) Some scholars said that the general meaning of `cattle' includes domesticated cattle, such as camels, cows and sheep, and wild cattle, such as gazzelle, wild cattle and wild donkeys. Allah made the exceptions mentioned above (dead animals blood, flesh of swine etc.), and prohibited hunting wild beasts while in the state of Ihram. It was also reported that the meaning here is, "We have allowed for you all types of cattle in all circumstances, except what We excluded herewith for the one hunting game while in the state of Ihram.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóäö ÇÖúØõÑøó ÛóíúÑó ÈóÇÛò æóáÇó ÚóÇÏò İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, and not transgressing, then, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This Ayah means, "We allowed eating the meat of dead animals, when one is forced by necessity, under the condition that one is not transgressing the limits or overstepping them.'' Here, Allah states, "Just as We allowed the meat of cattle in all conditions and circumstances, then do not hunt game when in the state of Ihram, for this is the decision of Allah, Who is the Most Wise in all that He commands and forbids.'' So Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóÍúßõãõ ãóÇ íõÑöíÏõ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah commands that which He wills.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Necessity of Observing the Sanctity of the Sacred Area and the Sacred Months</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah continues,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊõÍöáøõæÇú ÔóÚóÂÆöÑó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of Sha'a'ir Allah (the symbols of Allah),) Ibn `Abbas said, "Sha`a'ir Allah means the rituals of Hajj.'' Mujahid said, "As-Safa and Al-Marwah, and the sacrificial animal are the symbols of Allah.'' It was also stated that Sha`a'ir Allah is what He prohibited. Therefore, it means, do not violate what Allah prohibited. Allah said afterwards,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÇáÔøóåúÑó ÇáúÍóÑóÇãó</div><br>  (nor of the Sacred Month,) for you are required to respect and honor the Sacred Month and to refrain from what Allah forbade during it, such as fighting. This also lays emphasis on avoiding sins during that time. As Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÜóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáÔøóåúÑö ÇáúÍóÑóÇãö ŞöÊóÇáò İöíåö Şõáú ŞöÊóÇáñ İöíåö ßóÈöíÑñ</div><br>  (They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Month.

The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred: Three are in succession, (they are:) Dhul-Qa'dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thaniyah) and Sha'ban.) This Hadith testifies to the continued sanctity of these months until the end of time. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Taking the Hady to the Sacred House of Allah, Al-Ka`bah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÇáúåóÏúìó æóáÇó ÇáúŞóáóÜÆöÏó</div><br>  (nor of the Hady brought for sacrifice, nor the garlands,) means, do not abandon the practice of bringing the Hady (sacrificial animals) to the Sacred House, as this ritual is a form of honoring the symbols of Allah. Do not abandon the practice of garlanding these animals on their necks, so that they are distinguished from other cattle. This way, it will be known that these animals are intended to be offered as Hady at the Ka`bah, and thus those who might intend some harm to them would refrain from doing so. Those who see the Hady might be encouraged to imitate this ritual, and indeed, he who calls to a type of guidance, will earn rewards equal to the rewards of those who follow his lead, without decrease in their own rewards. When the Messenger of Allah intended to perform Hajj, he spent the night at Dhul-Hulayfah, which is also called Wadi Al-`Aqiq. In the morning, the Prophet made rounds with his wives, who were nine at that time, performed Ghusl (bath), applied some perfume and performed a two Rak`ah prayer. He then garlanded the Hady and announced aloud his intention to perform Hajj and `Umrah. The Prophet's Hady at the time consisted of plenty of camels, more than sixty, and they were among the best animals, the healthiest and most physically acceptable, just as Allah's statement proclaims,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó æóãóä íõÚóÙøöãú ÔóÚóÜÆöÑó Çááøóåö İóÅöäøóåóÇ ãöä ÊóŞúæóì ÇáúŞõáõæÈö </div><br>  (Thus it is, and whosoever honors the symbols of Allah, then it is truly, from the piety of the hearts.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÇáúŞóáóÜÆöÏó</div><br>  (nor the garlands) means, "Do not breach their sanctity.'' During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people used to garland themselves with animal hair and pelts when they left their areas in months other than the Sacred Months. The idolators of the Sacred House Area used to garland themselves with the tree-stems of the Sacred Area, so that they were granted safe passage.'' This statement was collected by Ibn Abi Hatim, who also recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "There are two Ayat in this Surah (Al-Ma'idah) that were abrogated, the Ayah about the garlands 5:2, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä ÌóÂÁõæßó İóÇÍúßõãú Èóíúäóåõãú Ãóæú ÃóÚúÑöÖú Úóäúåõãú</div><br>  n(So if they come to you (O Muhammad ), either judge between them, or turn away from them.)'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Necessity of Preserving the Sanctity and Safety of those who Intend to Travel to the Sacred House</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇ ÁóÇãøöíäó ÇáúÈóíúÊó ÇáúÍóÑóÇãó íóÈúÊóÛõæäó İóÖúáÇğ ãøöä ÑøóÈøöåöãú æóÑöÖúæóäÇğ</div><br>  (nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah), seeking the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord.) The Ayah commands: Do not fight people who are heading towards the Sacred House of Allah, which if anyone enters it, he must be granted safe refuge. Likewise, those who are heading towards the Sacred House seeking the bounty and good pleasure of Allah, must not be stopped, prevented, or frightened away from entering the Sacred House. Mujahid, `Ata', Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mutarrif bin `Abdullah, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Qatadah and several others said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÈúÊóÛõæäó İóÖúáÇğ ãøöä ÑøóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  (seeking the bounty of their Lord.) refers to trading. A similar discussion preceded concerning the Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó Úóáóíúßõãú ÌõäóÇÍñ Ãóä ÊóÈúÊóÛõæÇú İóÖúáÇğ ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú</div><br>  (There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading).) Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑöÖúæóäÇğ</div><br>  (and pleasure. ) Ibn `Abbas said that the word `pleasure' in the Ayah refers to, "seeking Allah's pleasure by their Hajj.'' `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Ibn Jarir mentioned that this Ayah was revealed concerning Al-Hutam bin Hind Al-Bakri, who had raided the cattle belonging to the people of Al-Madinah. The following year, he wanted to perform `Umrah to the House of Allah and some of the Companions wanted to attack him on his way to the House. Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇ ÁóÇãøöíäó ÇáúÈóíúÊó ÇáúÍóÑóÇãó íóÈúÊóÛõæäó İóÖúáÇğ ãøöä ÑøóÈøöåöãú æóÑöÖúæóäÇğ</div><br>  (nor the people coming to the Sacred House (Makkah), seeking the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Hunting Game is Permissible After Ihram Ends</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÍóáóáúÊõãú İóÇÕúØóÜÏõæÇú</div><br>  (But when you finish the Ihram, then hunt,) When you end your Ihram, it is permitted for you to hunt game, which was prohibited for you during Ihram. Although this Ayah contains a command that takes effect after the end of a state of prohibition (during Ihram in this case), the Ayah, in fact, brings back the ruling that was previously in effect. If the previous ruling was an obligation, the new command will uphold that obligation, and such is the case with recommended and permissible matters. There are many Ayat that deny that the ruling in such cases is always an obligation. Such is also the case against those who say that it is always merely allowed. What we mentioned here is the correct opinion that employs the available evidence, and Allah knows best. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Justice is Always Necessary</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÌúÑöãóäøóßõãú ÔóäóÂäõ Şóæúãò Ãóä ÕóÏøõæßõãú Úóäö ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏö ÇáúÍóÑóÇãö Ãóä ÊóÚúÊóÏõæÇú</div><br>  (and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part).)  The meaning of this Ayah is apparent, as it commands: Let not the hatred for some people, who prevented you from reaching the Sacred House in the year of Hudaybiyyah, make you transgress Allah's Law and commit injustice against them in retaliation. Rather, rule as Allah has commanded you, being just with every one. We will explain a similar Ayah later on,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÌúÑöãóäøóßõãú ÔóäóÂäõ Şóæúãò Úóáóì ÃóáÇøó ÊóÚúÏöáõæÇú ÇÚúÏöáõæÇú åõæó ÃóŞúÑóÈõ áöáÊøóŞúæóì</div><br>  (And let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety,) which commands: do not be driven by your hatred for some people into abandoning justice, for justice is ordained for everyone, in all situations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Zayd bin Aslam said, "The Messenger of Allah and his Companions were in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah when the idolators prevented them from visiting the House, and that was especially hard on them. Later on, some idolators passed by them from the east intending to perform `Umrah. So the Companions of the Prophet said, `Let us prevent those (from `Umrah) just as their fellow idolators prevented us.' Thereafter, Allah sent down this Ayah.'' Ibn Abbas and others said that "Shana'an'' refers to enmity and hate. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÚóÇæóäõæÇú Úóáóì ÇáúÈÑøö æóÇáÊøóŞúæóì æóáÇó ÊóÚóÇæóäõæÇú Úóáóì ÇáÅöËúãö æóÇáúÚõÏúæóÇäö</div><br>  (Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa; but do not help one another in sin and transgression.) Allah commands His believing servants to help one another perform righteous, good deeds, which is the meaning of `Al-Birr', and to avoid sins, which is the meaning of `At-Taqwa'. Allah forbids His servants from helping one another in sin, `Ithm' and committing the prohibitions. Ibn Jarir said that, "Ithm means abandoning what Allah has ordained, while transgression means overstepping the limits that Allah set in your religion, along with overstepping what Allah has ordered concerning yourselves and others.'' Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇäúÕõÑú ÃóÎóÇßó ÙóÇáöãğÇ Ãóæú ãóÙúáõæãğÇ»</div><br>  (Support your brother whether he was unjust or the victim of injustice.) He was asked, "O Messenger of Allah! We know about helping him when he suffers injustice, so what about helping him when he commits injustice'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóÍúÌõÒõåõ æóÊóãúäóÚõåõ ãöäó ÇáÙøõáúãö İóĞóÇßó äóÕúÑõå»</div><br>  (Prevent and stop him from committing injustice, and this represents giving support to him.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith through Hushaym. Ahmad recorded that one of the Companions of the Prophet narrated the Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúãõÄúãöäõ ÇáøóĞöí íõÎóÇáöØõ ÇáäøóÇÓó æóíóÕúÈöÑõ Úóáóì ÃóĞóÇåõãú ÃóÚúÙóãõ ÃóÌúÑğÇ ãöäó ÇáøóĞöí áóÇ íõÎóÇáöØõ ÇáäøóÇÓó æóáóÇ íóÕúÈöÑõ Úóáì ÃóĞóÇåõã»</div><br>  (The believer who mingles with people and is patient with their annoyance, earns more reward than the believer who does not mingle with people and does not observe patience with their annoyance.) Muslim recorded a Hadith that states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÏóÚóÇ Åöáóì åõÏğì ßóÇäó áóåõ ãöäó ÇáúÃóÌúÑö ãöËúáõ ÃõÌõæÑö ãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚóåõ Åöáì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö áóÇ íóäúŞõÕõ Ğáößó ãöäú ÃõÌõæÑöåöãú ÔóíúÆğÇ¡ æóãóäú ÏóÚóÇ Åöáóì ÖóáóÇáóÉò ßóÇäó Úóáóíúåö ãöäó ÇáúÅöËúãö ãöËúáõ ÂËóÇãö ãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚóåõ Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ áóÇ íóäúŞõÕõ Ğáößó ãöäú ÂËóÇãöåöãú ÔóíúÆğÇ»</div><br>  (He who calls to a guidance, will earn a reward similar to the rewards of those who accept his call, until the Day of Resurrection, without decreasing their rewards.
