Here, what is being sworn about is the affirmation of the final abode and the refutation against the claim of the ignorant that the resurrection of bodies will not occur. This is why Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÃõŞúÓöãõ Èöíóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö - æóáÇó ÃõŞúÓöãõ ÈöÇáäøóİúÓö ÇááøóæøóÇãóÉö </div><br>  (Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection. And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.) Qatadah said, "This means, I swear by both of these things.'' This has also been reported from Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr. Concerning the Day of Judgement, it is well known what it is. In reference to An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah, Qurrah bin Khalid reported from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he said about this Ayah, "Verily, by Allah, we think that every believer blames himself. He says (questioning himself), `What did I intend by my statement What did I intend by my eating What did I intend in what I said to myself' However, the sinner proceeds ahead and he does not blame himself.'' Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÃõŞúÓöãõ ÈöÇáäøóİúÓö ÇááøóæøóÇãóÉö </div><br>  (And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah) "He criticizes himself in good and bad.'' Similar has been reported from `Ikrimah. Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid: "He is sorry for what he missed (of good deeds) and he blames himself for it.'' Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíóÍúÓóÈõ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ Ãóáøóä äøóÌúãóÚó ÚöÙóÇãóåõ </div><br>  (Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones) meaning, `on the Day of Judgement does he think that We are not able to return his bones and gather them from their various places'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáóì ŞóÜÏöÑöíäó Úóáóì Ãóä äøõÓóæøöìó ÈóäóÇäóåõ </div><br>  (Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.) meaning, `does man think that We will not gather his bones Surely, We will gather them and We are quite able to put together his fingertips. This means Our power is suitable to gather (and recreate) them, and if We wished We could surely resurrect him with more than what he originally had. We could make his Banan, which are the tips of his fingers, all equal (in length).' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú íõÑöíÏõ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ áöíóİúÌõÑó ÃóãóÇãóåõ </div><br>  (Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.) Sa`id reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "This means to proceed forward.'' Mujahid said about,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíóİúÌõÑó ÃóãóÇãóåõ</div><br>  (to break out ahead of himself.) "This means that he wants to proceed ahead following his own whims.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "This refers to the disbeliever who denies the Day of Reckoning.'' Ibn Zayd said the same thing. Thus, Allah says after this,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÜóáõ ÃóíøóÇäó íóæúãõ ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö </div><br>  (He asks: "When will be this Day of Resurrection'') meaning, he says when will the Day of Judgement be His question is only a question of denying its occurrence, and rejecting its existence. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæäó ãóÊóì åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúæóÚúÏõ Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó Şõá áøóßõã ãøöíÚóÇÏõ íóæúãò áÇøó ÊóÓúÊóÜóÎöÑõæäó Úóäúåõ ÓóÇÚóÉğ æóáÇó ÊóÓúÊóŞúÏöãõæäó </div><br>  (And they say: "When is this promise if you are truthful'' Say: "The appointment to you is for a Day, which you cannot put back for an hour nor put forward.'') (34:29-30) Here Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ÈóÑöŞó ÇáúÈóÕóÑõ </div><br>  (So, when Bariqa the sight.) Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala' recited this Ayah as Bariqa with a Kasrah under the letter Ra, which means to be diminished. That which he (Abu `Amr) has said resembles the statement of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÑúÊóÏøõ Åöáóíúåöãú ØóÑúİõåõãú</div><br>  (Their gaze returning not towards them.) (14:43) meaning, they will be looking this way and that way in horror. Their gaze will not be able to rest upon anything due to the severity of the terror on that Day. Others recited it as Baraqa with a Fathah over the letter Ra, and its meaning is close to the first recitation (Bariqa). The intent here is that the eyes will be dazzled, humbled, diminished, and humiliated on the Day of Judgement due to the severity of the horrors and the greatness of the matters that they will witness on that Day. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÎóÓóİó ÇáúŞóãóÑõ </div><br>  (And the moon will be eclipsed.) meaning, its light will go away.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌõãöÚó ÇáÔøóãúÓõ æóÇáúŞóãóÑõ </div><br>  (And the sun and moon will be joined together.) Mujahid said, "They will be rolled up.'' In explaining this Ayah, Ibn Zayd recited the following Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÇáÔøóãúÓõ ßõæøöÑóÊú - æóÅöĞóÇ ÇáäøõÌõæãõ ÇäßóÏóÑóÊú </div><br>  (When the sun is wound round and its light is lost and is overthrown, and when the stars fall.) (81:1,2) It has been reported from Ibn Mas`ud that he recited the Ayah as, (æóÌõãöÚó Èóíúäó ÇáÔøóãúÓö æóÇáúŞóãóÑö) (and the sun and the moon will be joined between each other.) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ íóæúãóÆöĞò Ãóíúäó ÇáúãóİóÑøõ </div><br>  (On that Day man will say:"Where (is the refuge) to flee'') meaning, the human will see these horrors on the Day of Judgement and he will want to flee. He will say, "Where (is the place) to flee to'' This means, where is the escape or refuge Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó áÇó æóÒóÑó - Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó íóæúãóÆöĞò ÇáúãõÓúÊóŞóÑøõ </div><br>  (No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr and several others of the Salaf said, "There will be no salvation.'' This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ áóßõãú ãøöä ãøóáúÌóÃò íóæúãóÆöĞò æóãóÇ áóßõãú ãøöä äøóßöíÑò</div><br>  (You will have no refuge on that Day nor there will be for you any denying.) (42:47) meaning, `there will be no place for you to hide.' This is like what Allah says here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó æóÒóÑó</div><br>  (There is no refuge.) meaning, `there will be no place for you to seek shelter.' Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó íóæúãóÆöĞò ÇáúãõÓúÊóŞóÑøõ </div><br>  (Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) meaning, the place of return and the final destination. The Deeds of Man will be placed before Him on the Day of Judgement Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõäóÈøóÃõ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ íóæúãóÆöĞö ÈöãóÇ ŞóÏøóãó æóÃóÎøóÑó </div><br>  (On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) meaning, he will be informed of all of his deeds, the old of them and the recent of them, the first of them and the last of them, the small of them and the large of them. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóÌóÏõæÇú ãóÇ ÚóãöáõæÇú ÍóÇÖöÑğÇ æóáÇó íóÙúáöãõ ÑóÈøõßó ÃóÍóÏğÇ</div><br>  (And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no one with injustice.) (18:49) Likewise, Allah says here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáö ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ Úóáóì äóİúÓöåö ÈóÕöíÑóÉñ - æóáóæú ÃóáúŞóì ãóÚóÇĞöíÑóåõ </div><br>  (Nay! Man will be well informed about himself, though he may put forth his excuses.) meaning, he will be a witness against himself, knowing full well what he did, even though he will try to make excuses and deny it. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÑóÃú ßóÊóÜÈóßó ßóİóì ÈöäóİúÓößó Çáúíóæúãó Úóáóíúßó ÍóÓöíÈğÇ </div><br>  ((It will be said to him): "Read your book. You are sufficient as a reckoner against yourself this Day.'') `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáö ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ Úóáóì äóİúÓöåö ÈóÕöíÑóÉñ </div><br>  (Nay! Man will be well informed about himself.) "His hearing, his sight, his two hands, his two legs and his limbs.'' Qatadah said, "This means he is a witness against himself.'' In another narration from Qatadah he said, "By Allah! If you wish to see him, you would see him as someone who sees the shortcomings of the people and their sins, yet he is heedless of his own sins.'' It used to be said, "Verily, it is written in the Injil: `O Son of Adam, do you see the small splinters in the eye of your brother and disregard the tree stump that is in your eye, so you do not see it''' Mujahid said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÃóáúŞóì ãóÚóÇĞöíÑóåõ </div><br>  (Though he may put forth his excuses.) "This means, even though he argues in defense of it, he is a witness against it.'' Qatadah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÃóáúŞóì ãóÚóÇĞöíÑóåõ </div><br>  (Though he may put forth his excuses.) "Even though he will try to make false excuses on that Day, they will not be accepted from him.'' As-Suddi said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÃóáúŞóì ãóÚóÇĞöíÑóåõ </div><br>  (Though he may put forth his excuses.) "This means his argument.'' This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó áóãú Êóßõäú İöÊúäóÊõåõãú ÅöáÇøó Ãóä ŞóÇáõæÇú æóÇááøóåö ÑóÈøöäóÇ ãóÇ ßõäøóÇ ãõÔúÑößöíäó </div><br>  (There will then be no Fitnah for them but to say: "By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.'') (6:23) Allah also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÈúÚóËõåõãõ Çááøóåö ÌóãöíÚÇğ İóíóÍúáöİõæäó áóåõ ßóãóÇ íóÍúáöİõæäó áóßõãú æóíóÍúÓóÈõæäó Ãóäøóåõãú Úóáóì ÔóìúÁò ÃóáÇó Åöäøóåõãú åõãõ ÇáúßóÜĞöÈõæäó </div><br>  (On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you (O Muslims). And they think that they have something. Verily, they are liars!) (58:18) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÃóáúŞóì ãóÚóÇĞöíÑóåõ </div><br>  (Though he may put forth his excuses.) "This is apologizing.
