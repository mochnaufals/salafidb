He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇŞúÊõáõæåóÇ»</div><br>  (Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æõŞöíóÊú ÔóÑøóßõãú¡ ßóãóÇ æõŞöíÊõãú ÔóÑøóåóÇ»</div><br>  (It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)'' Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõÑúÓóáóÜÊö ÚõÑúİÇğ </div><br>  (By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõÑúÓóáóÜÊö ÚõÑúİÇğ </div><br>  (By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, "O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah . He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).'' Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÓúãö Çááøóåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö</div><br>  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  </div></body></html>
