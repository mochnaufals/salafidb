Qatadah commented, "Grace into the hearts of the believers'', that is, the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, on the Day of Al-Hudaybiyyah. The companions were they, who accepted the call of Allah and His Messenger and obeyed the decisions of Allah and His Messenger . When their hearts felt content with acceptance and were at peace, Allah increased their faith, joining it to the faith they already had. Al-Bukhari, and other Imams, relied on this Ayah as proof that faith increases and decreases in the hearts. Allah the Exalted said next that had He willed, He would have inflicted defeat on the disbelievers, Allah says;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöáøóåö ÌõäõæÏõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (And to Allah belong the armies of the heavens and the earth) and had He willed to send only one angel to them, that angel would have brought destruction to all what they had. However, Allah the Exalted willed Jihad and fighting to be established for, and by, the believers for great wisdom, clear reasons and unequivocal evidences that He had in all this. This is why Allah the Great said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÚóáöíãÇğ ÍóßöíãÇğ</div><br>  (and Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.)

This good news is for you, so what good news do we have'' Allah the Exalted sent down this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíõÏúÎöáó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó æóÇáúãõÄúãöäóÜÊö ÌóäøóÜÊò ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÇ ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÇ</div><br>  (That He may admit the believing men and the believing women to Gardens under which rivers flow to abide therein forever,) meaning they will remain in Paradise forever,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõßóİøöÑó Úóäúåõãú ÓóíøöÆóÜÊöåöãú</div><br>  (and He may expiate from them their sins;) Allah will not punish them for their errors and mistakes.

(3:185) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÚóĞøöÈó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó æóÇáúãõäóÜİöŞóÜÊö æóÇáúãõÔúÑößöíäó æóÇáúãõÔúÑößóÜÊö ÇáÙøóÂäøöíäó ÈöÇááøóåö Ùóäøó ÇáÓøóæúÁö</div><br>  (And that He may punish the hypocrites, men and women, and also the idolators, men and women, who think evil thoughts about Allah,) who question the wisdom in Allah's decisions and think that the Messenger and his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, might be killed and exterminated. This is why Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóíúåöãú ÏóÂÆöÑóÉõ ÇáÓøóæúÁö æóÛóÖöÈó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöãú æóáóÚóäóåõãú</div><br>  (for them is a disgraceful torment.

Allah the Exalted and Most Honored asserted His ability to take revenge from the enemies of Islam and all disbelievers and hypocrites,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöáøóåö ÌõäõæÏõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÚóÒöíÒÇğ ÍóßöíãÇğ </div><br>  (And to Allah belong the armies of the heavens and the earth.
