If you are in doubt as to my religion, then (know that) I will never worship those whom you worship besides Allah. But I worship Allah Who causes you to die.) (10:104) The fact that the word "Rabb'' (Lord) is connected to the word city (in the phrase "the Lord of this city'') is a sign of honor and divine care for that city. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáúíóÚúÈõÏõæÇú ÑóÈøó åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúÈóíúÊö - ÇáøóĞöì ÃóØúÚóãóåõã ãøöä ÌõæÚò æóÁóÇãóäóåõã ãøöäú Îæúİò </div><br>  (So let them worship the Lord of this House (the Ka`bah), Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.)

This was reported in Sahih, Hasan, Musnad narrarations, through various routes, by such a large group that it is absolutely unquestionable, as has been explained in the appropriate place in the book Al-Ahkam, to Allah is the praise and thanks.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóåõ ßõáøõ ÔóìÁò</div><br>  (and to Whom belongs everything.) This is a statement of general application following a specific statement, i.e., He is the Lord of this city, and the Lord and Sovereign of all things, there is no god worthy of worship besides Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõãöÑúÊõ Ãóäú Ãóßõæäó ãöäó ÇáúãõÓúáöãöíäó</div><br>  (And I am commanded to be from among the Muslims. ) means, those who believe in Allah alone, who are sincere towards Him and who obediently follow His commands.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäú ÃóÊúáõæó ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäó</div><br>  (And that I should recite the Qur'an,) means, to people, so as to convey it to them.

Allah will judge their nations to whom they were sent, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóãóÇ Úóáóíúßó ÇáúÈóáóÜÛõ æóÚóáóíúäóÇ ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈõ</div><br>  (your duty is only to convey and on Us is the reckoning) (13: 40).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóäÊó äóĞöíÑñ æóÇááøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò æóßöíáñ</div><br>  (But you are only a warner.

Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóíõÑöíßõãú ÁóÇíóÜÊöåö İóÊóÚúÑöİõæäóåóÇ</div><br>  (He will show you His Ayat (signs), and you shall recognize them.)

It was recorded that Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy upon him, used to recite the following two lines of verse, whether they were written by him or someone else: "If you are alone one day, do not say, `I am alone.' Rather say, `Someone is watching me.' Do not think that Allah will let His attention wander for even an instant, or that anything is hidden from Him.'' This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat An-Naml. All praise and thanks be to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
