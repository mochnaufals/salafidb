He states that it has been brought down by the trustworthy Ruh (i.e., Jibril) who is helped by Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊóäóÒøóáóÊú Èöåö ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäõ </div><br>  (And it is not the Shayatin who have brought it down.) Then He tells us that it could not be the case for three reasons that the Shayatin brought it down. One is that it would not suit them, i.e., they have no desire to do so and they do not want to, because their nature is to corrupt and misguide people, but this contains words enjoining what is right and forbidding what is evil, and light, guidance and mighty proofs. There is a big difference between this and the Shayatin, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóäÈóÛöì áóåõãú</div><br>  (Neither would it suit them)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÓúÊóØöíÚõæäó</div><br>  (nor are they able.) meaning, even if they wanted to, they could not do it. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú ÃóäÒóáúäóÇ åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäó Úóáóì ÌóÈóáò áøóÑóÃóíúÊóåõ ÎóÜÔöÚÇğ ãøõÊóÕóÏøöÚÇğ ãøöäú ÎóÔúíóÉö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rent asunder by the fear of Allah) (59:21). Then Allah explains that even if they wanted to and were able to bear it and convey it, they still would not be able to achieve that, because they were prevented from hearing the Qur'an when it was brought down, for the heavens were filled with guardians and shooting stars at the time when the Qur'an was being revealed to the Messenger of Allah , so none of the Shayatin could hear even one letter of it, lest there be any confusion in the matter. This is a part of Allah's mercy towards His servants, protection of His Laws, and support for His Book and His Messenger .
