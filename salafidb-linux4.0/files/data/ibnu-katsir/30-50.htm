That is a matter which rests with Allah, for by His power He can make the dead hear the voices of the living if He wills. He guides whom He wills and sends astray whom He wills, and no one but He has the power to do this. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊõÓúãöÚõ ÅöáÇøó ãóä íõÄúãöäõ ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ İóåõã ãøõÓúáöãõæäó</div><br>  (you can make to hear only those who believe in Our Ayat, and have submitted (to Allah in Islam).) means, those who are humble and who respond and obey. These are the ones who will listen to the truth and follow it; this is the state of the believers; the former (being deaf and blind) is the state of the disbelievers, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ íóÓúÊóÌöíÈõ ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÓúãóÚõæäó æóÇáúãóæúÊóì íóÈúÚóËõåõãõ Çááøóåõ Ëõãøó Åöáóíúåö íõÑúÌóÚõæäó </div><br>  (It is only those who listen will respond, but as for the dead, Allah will raise them up, then to Him they will be returned.) (6:36) `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, may Allah be pleased with her, used this Ayah --   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßó áÇó ÊõÓúãöÚõ ÇáúãóæúÊóì</div><br>  (So verily, you cannot make the dead to hear) as evidence against `Abdullah bin `Umar when he reported that the Prophet had addressed the slain disbelievers who had been thrown into a dry well three days after the battle of Badr, rebuking and reprimanding them, until `Umar said, "O Messenger of Allah, are you addressing people who are dead bodies'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö ãóÇ ÃóäúÊõãú ÈöÃóÓúãóÚó áöãóÇ ÃóŞõæáõ ãöäúåõãú¡ æóáóßöäú áóÇ íõÌöíÈõæä»</div><br>  (By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, you do not hear what I say any better than they do, but they cannot respond.) s`A'ishah interpreted this event to mean that the Prophet was making the point that now they would know that what he had been telling them was true. Qatadah said: "Allah brought them back to life for him so that they could hear what he said by way of rebuke and vengeance.''  </div></body></html>
