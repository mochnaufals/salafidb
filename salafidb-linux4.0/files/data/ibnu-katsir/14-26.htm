Similar is said by Ad-Dahhak, Sa'id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Mujahid and several others. They stated that this parable describes the believer's deeds, good statements and good actions. The believer is just like the beneficial date tree, always having good actions ascending at all times, by day and by night. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, "We were with the Messenger of Allah when he asked,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÎúÈöÑõæäöí Úóäú ÔóÌóÑóÉò ÊõÔúÈöåõ Ãóæú ßóÇáÑøóÌõáö ÇáúãõÓúáöãö áóÇ íóÊóÍóÇÊøõ æóÑóŞõåóÇ ÕóíúİğÇ æóáóÇ ÔöÊóÇÁğ¡ æóÊõÄúÊöí ÃõßõáóåóÇ ßõáøó Íöíäò ÈöÅöĞúäö ÑóÈøöåóÇ»</div><br>  (Tell me about a tree that resembles the Muslim, the leaves of which do not fall in summer or winter and gives its fruit at all times by the leave of its Lord.)'' Ibn `Umar said, "I thought of the date palm tree, but felt shy to answer when I saw that Abu Bakr and `Umar did not talk. When they did not give an answer, the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åöíó ÇáäøóÎúáóÉ»</div><br>  (It is the date palm tree.) When we departed, I said to `Umar, `My father, by Allah! I thought that it was the date tree.' He said, `Why did you not speak then' I said, `I saw you were silent and I felt shy to say anything.' `Umar said, `Had you said it, it would have been more precious to me than such things (i.e., would have been very precious to me).''' `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÔóÌóÑÉò ØóíøöÈóÉò</div><br>  (as a goodly tree), is a tree in Paradise. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõÄúÊöì ÃõßõáóåóÇ ßõáøó Íöíäò</div><br>  (Giving its fruit at all times,) It is said that it means by day and by night. And they say that describes the believer as a tree that always has fruits during summer and winter, by night and by day. This is the parable of the believer whose good works ascend to heaven by day and by night and at all times,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÅöĞúäö ÑóÈøöåóÇ</div><br>  (by the leave of its Lord, ) thus earning perfection and becoming beneficial, plentiful, pure and blessed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÖúÑöÈõ Çááøóåõ ÇáÃóãúËóÇáó áöáäøóÇÓö áóÚóáøóåõãú íóÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (and Allah sets forth parables for mankind in order that they may remember.)  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóËáõ ßóáöãóÉò ÎóÈöíËóÉò ßóÔóÌóÑóÉò ÎóÈöíËóÉò</div><br>  (And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree) describing the disbelief of the disbeliever, for it has no basis or stability. It is similar to the colocynth tree (a very bitter, unscented plant) which is also called, `Ash-Shiryan'. Shu`bah narrated that Mu`awiyah bin Abi Qurrah narrated that Anas bin Malik said that it is the colocynth tree. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÌúÊõËøóÊú</div><br>  (uprooted), meaning, was cutoff from the root,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä İóæúŞö ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ãóÇ áóåóÇ ãöä ŞóÑóÇÑò</div><br>  (from the surface of earth, having no stability.) therefore, existing without basis or stabililty, just like Kufr (disbelief), for it does not have a basis or roots. Surely, the works of the disbelievers will never ascend nor will any of them be accepted.  </div></body></html>
