Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr!'' Allah sent down the Ayah of Surat Al-Baqarah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÜóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáúÎóãúÑö æóÇáúãóíúÓöÑö Şõáú İöíåöãóÂ ÅöËúãñ ßóÈöíÑñ</div><br>  (They ask you (O Muhammad ) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: "In them is a great sin...)  `Umar was then summoned and the Ayah was recited to him. Yet, he still said, "O Allah! Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr.'' Then, this Ayah that is in Surat An-Nisa' was revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóŞúÑóÈõæÇú ÇáÕøóáóæÉó æóÃóäÊõãú ÓõßóÜÑóì</div><br>  (O you who believe! Approach not As-Salah (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state.) (4:43)  Then, when the prayer was called for, a person used to herald on behalf of Allah's Messenger , "No drunk person should attend the prayer.'' `Umar was summoned again and the Ayah was recited to him. Yet, he still said, "O Allah! Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr.'' Then, the Ayah that is in Surat Al-Ma'idah was revealed, `Umar was again summoned and the Ayah was recited to him. When he reached:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóáú ÃóäúÊõãú ãøõäÊóåõæäó</div><br>  (So, will you not then abstain) (5:91) he said, "We did abstain, we did abstain.'' This is also the narration that Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasai collected in their books. `Ali bin Al-Madini and At-Tirmidhi said that the chain of narrators for this Hadith is sound and authentic. We will mention this Hadith again along with what Imam Ahmad collected by Abu Hurayrah Allah's saying in Surat Al-Ma'idah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáúÎóãúÑõ æóÇáúãóíúÓöÑõ æóÇáÇøñäÕóÇÈõ æóÇáÇøñÒúáÇóãõ ÑöÌúÓñ ãøöäú Úóãóáö ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö İóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæåõ áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊõİúáöÍõæäó</div><br>  (Intoxicants and gambling, and Al-Ansab, and Al-Azlam are an abomination of Satan's handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.) (5:90)  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÜóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáúÎóãúÑö æóÇáúãóíúÓöÑö</div><br>  (They ask you (O Muhammad ) concerning alcoholic drinks and gambling.)  As for Al-Khamr, `Umar bin Khattab, the Leader of the faithful, used to say, "It includes all what intoxicates the mind.'' We will also mention this statement in the explanation of Surat Al-Ma'idah, along with the topic of gambling.  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú İöíåöãóÂ ÅöËúãñ ßóÈöíÑñ æóãóäóÜİöÚõ áöáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (Say: In them is a great sin, and (some) benefits for men.)  As for the harm that the Khamr and gambling cause, it effects the religion. As for their benefit, it is material, including benefit for the body, digesting the food, getting rid of the excrements, sharpening the mind, bringing about a joyous sensation and financially benefiting from their sale. Also, (their benefit includes) earnings through gambling that one uses to spend on his family and on himself. Yet, these benefits are outweighed by the clear harm that they cause which affects the mind and the religion. This is why Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöËúãõåõãóÂ ÃóßúÈóÑõ ãöä äøóİúÚöåöãóÇ</div><br>  (...but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.)  This Ayah was the beginning of the process of prohibiting Khamr, not explicity, but it only implied this meaning. So when this Ayah was recited to `Umar, he still said, "O Allah! Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr.'' Soon after, Allah sent down a clear prohibition of Khamr in Surat Al-Ma'idah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÂãóäõæÇú ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáúÎóãúÑõ æóÇáúãóíúÓöÑõ æóÇáÇøñäÕóÇÈõ æóÇáÇøñÒúáÇóãõ ÑöÌúÓñ ãøöäú Úóãóáö ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö İóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæåõ áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊõİúáöÍõæäó - ÅöäøóãóÇ íõÑöíÏõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ Ãóä íõæŞöÚó Èóíúäóßõãõ ÇáúÚóÏóÇæóÉó æóÇáúÈóÛúÖóÂÁó İöì ÇáúÎóãúÑö æóÇáúãóíúÓöÑö æóíóÕõÏøóßõãú Úóä ĞößúÑö Çááøóåö æóÚóäö ÇáÕøóáóæÉö İóåóáú ÃóäúÊõãú ãøõäÊóåõæäó </div><br>  (O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab, and Al-Azlam are an abomination of Shaytan's handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from As-Salah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain) (5:90, 91)  We will mention this subject, by the will of Allah, when we explain Surat Al-Ma'idah.  Ibn `Umar, Ash-Sha`bi, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Aslam stated that the first Ayah revealed about Khamr was:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÜóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáúÎóãúÑö æóÇáúãóíúÓöÑö Şõáú İöíåöãóÂ ÅöËúãñ ßóÈöíÑñ</div><br>  (They ask you about Khamr and gambling. Say: "In them there is great sin.'') (2:219)  Then, the Ayah in Surat An-Nisa' was revealed (on this subject) and then the Ayah in Surat Al-Ma'idah which prohibited Khamr. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Spending whatever One could spare of his Money on Charity</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÜóáõæäóßó ãóÇĞóÇ íõäİöŞõæäó Şõáö ÇáúÚóİúæó</div><br>  (And they ask you what they ought to spend. Say: "That which is (spare) beyond your needs.'')  Al-Hakam said that Miqsam said that Ibn `Abbas said that this Ayah means, whatever you can spare above the needs of your family. This is also the opinion of Ibn `Umar, Mujahid, `Ata', `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Al-Qasim, Salim, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas.  Ibn Jarir related that Abu Hurayrah said that a man said, "O Messenger of Allah! I have a Dinar (a currency).'' The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúİöŞúåõ Úóáì äóİúÓöß»</div><br>  (Spend it you on yourself.) He said, "I have another Dinar.'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúİöŞúåõ Úóáì Ãóåúáöß»</div><br>  (Spend it on your wife.) He said, "I have another Dinar.'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúİöŞúåõ Úóáì æóáóÏöß»</div><br>  (Spend it on your offspring.) He said, "I have another Dinar.'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÃóäúÊó ÃóÈúÕóÑ»</div><br>  (You have better knowledge (meaning how and where to spend it in charity).)  Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih.  Muslim recorded that Jabir said that Allah's Messenger said to a man:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÈúÏóÃú ÈöäóİúÓößó İóÊóÕóÏøóŞú ÚóáóíúåóÇ¡ İóÅöäú İóÖóáó ÔóíúÁñ İóáöÃóåúáößó¡ İóÅöäú İóÖóáó ÔóíúÁñ Úóäú Ãóåúáößó İóáöĞöí ŞóÑóÇÈóÊößó¡ İóÅöäú İóÖóáó Úóäú Ğöí ŞóÑóÇÈóÊößó ÔóíúÁñ İóåßóĞóÇ æóåßóĞóÇ»</div><br>  (Start with yourself and grant it some charity. If anything remains, then spend it on your family. If anything remains, then spend it on your relatives. If anything remains, then spend it like this and like that (i.e., on various charitable purposes).)  A Hadith states:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÈúäó ÂÏóãó Åöäøóßó Ãóäú ÊóÈúĞõáó ÇáúİóÖúáó ÎóíúÑñ áóßó¡ æóÃóäú ÊõãúÓößóåõ ÔóÑøñ áóßó¡ æóáóÇ ÊõáóÇãõ Úóáì ßóİóÇİ»</div><br>  (O son of Adam! If you spend whatever you can spare, it would be better for you; but if you keep it, it would be worse for you. You shall not be blamed for whatever is barely sufficient.)  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞáößó íõÈíøöäõ Çááøóåõ áóßõãõ ÇáÂíóÜÊö áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÊóİóßøóÑõæäóİöì ÇáÏøõäõíóÇ æóÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö</div><br>  (Thus Allah makes clear to you His Ayat in order that you may give thought. In (to) this worldly life and in the Hereafter.) meaning, just as He stated and explained these commandments for you, He also explains the rest of His Ayat regarding the commandments and His promises and warnings, so that you might give thought in this life and the Hereafter. `Ali bin Abu Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas commented, "Meaning about the imminent demise and the brevity of this life, and the imminent commencement of the Hereafter and its continuity.'' a <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Maintaining the Orphan's Property</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÜóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáúíóÊóÜãóì Şõáú ÅöÕúáÇóÍñ áøóåõãú ÎóíúÑñ æóÅöä ÊõÎóÇáöØõæåõãú İóÅöÎúæóäõßõãú æóÇááøóåõ íóÚúáóãõ ÇáúãõİúÓöÏó ãöäó ÇáúãõÕúáöÍö æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ áÃóÚúäóÊóßõãú</div><br>  (And they ask you concerning orphans. Say: "The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers. And Allah knows him who means mischief (e.g., to swallow their property) from him who means good (e.g., to save their property). And if Allah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties.)  Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "When the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóŞúÑóÈõæÇú ãóÇáó ÇáúíóÊöíãö ÅöáÇøó ÈöÇáøóÊöì åöìó ÃóÍúÓóäõ</div><br>  (And come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it.)

(4:10) were revealed, those who took care of some orphans, separated their food and drink from the orphans' food and drink. When some of the orphans' food and drink remained, they would keep it for them until they eat it or otherwise get spoiled. This situation was difficult for them and they mentioned this subject to Allah's Messenger .   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÜóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáúíóÊóÜãóì Şõáú ÅöÕúáÇóÍñ áøóåõãú ÎóíúÑñ æóÅöä ÊõÎóÇáöØõæåõãú İóÅöÎúæóäõßõãú</div><br>  (And they ask you concerning orphans. Say: "The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers.) Hence, they joined their food and drink with the food and drink of the orphans.'' This Hadith was also collected by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak. Several others said similarly about the circumstances surrounding the revelation of the Ayah (2:220), including Mujahid, `Ata', Ash-Sha`bi, Ibn Abu Layla, Qatadah and others among the Salaf and those after them.  Ibn Jarir reported that `A'ishah said, "I dislike that an orphan's money be under my care, unless I mix my food with his food and my drink with his drink.''  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÅöÕúáÇóÍñ áøóåõãú ÎóíúÑñ</div><br>  (Say: The best thing is to work honestly in their property.) meaning, on the one hand (i.e., this is required in any case). Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÊõÎóÇáöØõæåõãú İóÅöÎúæóäõßõãú</div><br>  (...and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers.) meaning, there is no harm if you mix your food and drink with their food and drink, since they are your brothers in the religion. This is why Allah said afterwards:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóÚúáóãõ ÇáúãõİúÓöÏó ãöäó ÇáúãõÕúáöÍö</div><br>  (And Allah knows (the one) who means mischief (e.g., to swallow their property) from (the one) who means good (e.g., to save their property). ) meaning, He knows those whose intent is to cause mischief or righteousness. He also said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ áÃóÚúäóÊóßõãú Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÚóÒöíÒñ Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (And if Allah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties. Truly, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise) meaning, if Allah wills, He will make this matter difficult for you. But, He made it easy for you, and allowed you to mix your affairs with the orphans' affairs in a way that is better. Similarly, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóŞúÑóÈõæÇú ãóÇáó ÇáúíóÊöíãö ÅöáÇøó ÈöÇáøóÊöì åöìó ÃóÍúÓóäõ</div><br>  (And come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it.) (6:152)  Allah has thus allowed spending from the orphan's estate by its executor, in reasonable proportions, on the condition that he has the intention to compensate the orphan later on, when he can afford it. We will mention about it in detail in Surat An-Nisa' by Allah's will.  </div></body></html>
