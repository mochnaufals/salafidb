They did this due to their defiance and rejection of the Messengers, denial of the truth and refusal to follow it. They also killed many Prophets when they conveyed to them what Allah legislated for them, without cause or criminal behavior committed by these Prophets, for they only called them to the truth,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞúÊõáõæäó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÃúãõÑõæäó ÈöÇáúŞöÓúØö ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (And kill those men who order just dealings) thus, demonstrating the worst type of arrogance.

Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈóÔøöÑúåõãú ÈöÚóĞóÇÈò Ãóáöíãò </div><br>  (then announce to them a painful torment) meaning, painful and humiliating,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæáóÜÆößó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÍóÈöØóÊú ÃóÚúãóÜáõåõãú İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö æóãóÇ áóåõã ãøöä äøóÜÕöÑöíäó </div><br>  (They are those whose works will be lost in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. ).  </div></body></html>
