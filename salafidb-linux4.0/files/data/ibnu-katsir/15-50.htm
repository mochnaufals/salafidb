He tells us that they will dwell in Gardens and water springs.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúÎõáõæåóÇ ÈöÓóáóÜãò</div><br>  (Enter it in peace) meaning free of all problems.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÁóÇãöäöíäó</div><br>  (and security.) meaning free from all fear and concern. They will not have any fear of expulsion, nor will they fear that their condition will be disrupted or end.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÒóÚúäóÇ ãóÇ İöì ÕõÏõæÑöåöã ãøöäú Ûöáøò ÅöÎúæóÇäğÇ Úóáóì ÓõÑõÑò ãøõÊóŞóÜÈöáöíäó </div><br>  (And We shall remove any deep feeling of bitterness from their breasts. (So they will be like) brothers facing each other on thrones.) Al-Qasim narrated that Abu Umamah said: "The people of Paradise will enter Paradise with whatever enmity is left in their hearts from this world. Then, when they come together, Allah will remove whatever hatred the world has left in their hearts.'' Then he recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÒóÚúäóÇ ãóÇ İöì ÕõÏõæÑöåöã ãøöäú Ûöáøò</div><br>  (And We shall remove any deep feeling of bitterness from their breasts.) This is how it was narrated in this report, but Al-Qasim bin `Abdur-Rahman is weak in his reports from Abu Umamah. However, this is in accord with the report in the Sahih where Qatadah says, "Abu Al-Mutawakkil An-Naji told us that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri told them that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÎúáõÕõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ İóíõÍúÈóÓõæäó Úóáóì ŞóäúØóÑóÉò Èóíúäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóÇáäøóÇÑö.

Then judgment will be passed between them concerning any wrong they have committed in this world against one another, until they are cleansed and purified. Then permission will be given to them to enter Paradise.)''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóãóÓøõåõãú İöíåóÇ äóÕóÈñ</div><br>  (No sense of fatigue shall touch them) meaning no harm or hardship, as was reported in the Sahihs:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóäøó Çááåó ÃóãóÑóäöí Ãóäú ÃõÈóÔøöÑó ÎóÏöíÌóÉó ÈöÈóíúÊò İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ãöäú ŞóÕóÈò áóÇ ÕóÎóÈó İöíåö æóáóÇ äóÕóÈ»</div><br>  (Allah commanded me to tell Khadijah the good news of a jeweled palace in Paradise in which there will be no toil and no fatigue.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ åõãú ãøöäúåóÇ ÈöãõÎúÑóÌöíäó</div><br>  (nor shall they (ever) be asked to leave it.)

You will be healthy and never fall sick; you will live and never die; you will be young and never grow old; you will stay here and never leave.) Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÇ áÇó íóÈúÛõæäó ÚóäúåóÇ ÍöæóáÇğ </div><br>  (Wherein they shall dwell (forever). They will have no desire to be removed from it.)

And that My torment is indeed the most painful torment.) meaning, `O Muhammad, tell My servants that I am the source of mercy and I am the source of punishment.' Similar Ayat to this have already been quoted above, which indicate that we must always be in a state between hope (for Allah's mercy) and fear (of His punishment).  </div></body></html>
