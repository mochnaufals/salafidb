O you who believe! If you obey and fear Allah, He will grant you Furqan, and will expiate for you your sins, and forgive you; and Allah is the Owner of the great bounty.)</div>  Ibn `Abbas, As-Suddi, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan and several others said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İõÑúŞóÇäğÇ</div><br>  (Furqan), means, `a way out'; Mujahid added, "In this life and the Hereafter.'' In another narration, Ibn `Abbas is reported to have said, `Furqan' means `salvation' or -- according to another narration -- `aid'. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that `Furqan' means `criterion between truth and falsehood'. This last explanation from Ibn Ishaq is more general than the rest that we mentioned, and it also includes the other meanings. Certainly, those who have Taqwa of Allah by obeying what He ordained and abstaining from what he forbade, will be guided to differentiate between the truth and the falsehood. This will be a triumph, safety and a way out for them from the affairs of this life, all the while acquiring happiness in the Hereafter. They will also gain forgiveness, thus having their sins erased, and pardon, thus having their sins covered from other people, as well as, being directed to a way to gain Allah's tremendous rewards,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÁóÇãöäõæÇú ÈöÑóÓõæáöåö íõÄúÊößõãú ßöİúáóíúäö ãöä ÑøóÍúãóÊöåö æóíóÌúÚóá áøóßõãú äõæÑÇğ ÊóãúÔõæäó Èöåö æóíóÛúİöÑú áóßõãú æóÇááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (O you who believe!
