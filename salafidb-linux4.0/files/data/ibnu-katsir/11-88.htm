It has been said that he meant the prophethood. It has also been said that he meant the lawful provisions. It seems that the verse carries both meanings.

This is similar to what Qatadah said concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃõÑöíÏõ Ãóäú ÃõÎóÇáöİóßõãú Åöáóì ãóÂ ÃóäúåóÜßõãú Úóäúåõ</div><br>  (I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you.)

This has been said by Mujahid and others.  </div></body></html>
