The first view is supported by the Hadith of Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, in the Two Sahihs, according to which the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÃóÈóÇ ĞóÑó ÃóÊóÏúÑöí Ãóíúäó ÊóĞúåóÈõ åóĞöåö ÇáÔøóãúÓõ¿»</div><br>  (O Abu Dharr! Do you know where this sun goes) I (Abu Dharr) said: "Allah and His Messenger know best.'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöäøóåóÇ ÊóĞúåóÈõ İóÊóÓúÌõÏõ ÊóÍúÊó ÇáúÚóÑúÔö¡ Ëõãøó ÊóÓúÊóÃúĞöäõ ÑóÈøóåóÇ İóíõæÔößõ Ãóäú íõŞóÇáó áóåóÇ: ÇÑúÌöÚöí ãöäú ÍóíúËõ ÌöÆúÊ»</div><br>  (It goes and prostrates beneath the Throne, then it seeks permission from its Lord, and soon it will be said: "Go back from whence you came.'') Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "The sun is like flowing water, running in its course in the sky during the day. When it sets, it travels in its course beneath the earth until it rises in the east.'' He said, "The same is true in the case of the moon.'' Its chain of narration is Sahih.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó Çááøóåó ÈöãóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó ÎóÈöíÑñ</div><br>  (and that Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÚúáóãú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó íóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Know you not that Allah knows all that is in the heaven and the earth) (22:70). The meaning is that Allah is the Creator Who knows all things, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó ÓóÈúÚó ÓóãóÜæóÊò æóãöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ãöËúáóåõäøó</div><br>  (It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof) (65:12).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÈöÃóäøó Çááøóåó åõæó ÇáúÍóŞøõ æóÃóäøó ãóÇ íóÏúÚõæäó ãöä Ïõæäöåö ÇáúÈóÜØöáõ</div><br>  (That is because Allah, He is the Truth, and that which they invoke besides Him is falsehood;) means, He shows you His Signs so that you may know from them that He is the Truth, i.e., He truly exists and is truly divine, and that all else besides Him is falsehood. He has no need of anything else, but everything else is dependent on Him, because everything in heaven and on earth is created by Him and is enslaved by Him; none of them could move even an atom's weight except with His permission. If all the people of heaven and earth were to come together to create a fly, they would not be able to do so. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÈöÃóäøó Çááøóåó åõæó ÇáúÍóŞøõ æóÃóäøó ãóÇ íóÏúÚõæäó ãöä Ïõæäöåö ÇáúÈóÜØöáõ æóÃóäøó Çááøóåó åõæó ÇáúÚóáöìøõ ÇáúßóÈöíÑõ </div><br>  (That is because Allah, He is the Truth, and that which they invoke besides Him is falsehood; and that Allah, He is the Most High, the Most Great.) meaning, He is the Most High and there is none higher than Him, and He is the Most Great Who is greater than everything. Everything is subjugated and insignificant in comparison to Him.  </div></body></html>
