Ibn `Abbas, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, As-Suddi and several others commented that she prepared a sitting room which had couches, pillows to recline on and food that requires knives to cut, such as citron. This is why Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóÊú ßõáøó æóÇÍöÏóÉò ãøóäúåõäøó ÓößøöíäğÇ</div><br>  (and she gave each one of them a knife), as a part of her plan of revenge for their plot to see Yusuf,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáóÊö ÇÎúÑõÌú Úóáóíúåöäøó</div><br>  (and she said to Yusuf: "Come out before them.''), for she had asked him to stay somewhere else in the house,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÂ</div><br>  (Then, when) he went out and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÃóíúäóåõ ÃóßúÈóÑúäóåõ</div><br>  (they saw him, they exalted him) they thought highly of him and were astonished at what they saw. They started cutting their hands in amazement at his beauty, while thinking that they were cutting the citron with their knives. Therefore, they injured their hands with the knives they were holding, according to several reports of Tafsir. Others said that after they ate and felt comfortable, and after having placed citron in front of them, giving each one of them a knife, the wife of the `Aziz asked them, "Would you like to see Yusuf'' They said, "Yes.'' So she sent for him to come in front of them and when they saw him, they started cutting their hands. She ordered him to keep coming and going, so that they saw him from all sides, and he went back in while they were still cutting their hands. When they felt the pain, they started screaming and she said to them, "You did all this from one look at him, so how can I be blamed   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõáúäó ÍóÇÔó ááøóåö ãóÇ åóÜĞóÇ ÈóÔóÑğÇ Åöäú åóÜĞóÂ ÅöáÇøó ãóáóßñ ßóÑöíãñ</div><br>  (They said: "How perfect is Allah!

They never saw anyone like Yusuf before, for he, peace be upon him, was given half of all beauty. An authentic Hadith stated that the Messenger of Allah passed by Prophet Yusuf, during the Night of Isra' in the third heaven and commented,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöĞóÇ åõæó ŞóÏú ÃõÚúØöíó ÔóØúÑó ÇáúÍõÓúä»</div><br>  (He was given a half of all beauty.)

She said: "This is he (the young man) about whom you did blame me...'') She said these words to them so that they excuse her behavior, for a man who looks this beautiful and perfect, is worthy of being loved, she thought. She said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÑóÇæóÏÊøõåõ Úóä äøóİúÓöåö İóÇÓóÊóÚúÕóãó</div><br>  (and I did seek to seduce him, but he refused) to obey me. Some scholars said that when the women saw Yusuf's beauty, she told them about his inner beauty that they did not know of, being chaste and beautiful from the inside and outside.

Verily, You are sought for each and everything, and our total reliance is on You Alone for each and everything.

So his Lord answered his invocation) Yusuf, peace be upon him, was immune from error by Allah's will, and He saved him from accepting the advances of the wife of the `Aziz'. He preferred prison, rather than accept her illicit call. This indicates the best and most perfect grade in this case, for Yusuf was youthful, beautiful and full of manhood. His master's wife was calling him to herself, and she was the wife of the `Aziz of Egypt. She was also very beautiful and wealthy, as well as having a great social rank. He refused all this and preferred prison, for he feared Allah and hoped to earn His reward.
