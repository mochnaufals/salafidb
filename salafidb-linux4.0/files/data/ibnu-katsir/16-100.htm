The Hadiths mentioned about seeking refuge with Allah (Isti`adhah), were quoted in our discussion at the beginning of this Tafsir, praise be to Allah. The reason for seeking refuge with Allah before reading is that the reader should not get confused or mixed up, and that the Shaytan would not confuse him or stop him from thinking about and pondering over the meaning of what he reads. Hence the majority of scholars said that refuge should be sought with Allah before starting to read.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>≈цдшуех бунъ”у буех ”хбъЎу«дс Џубум «бшу–цнду Ѕу«гудхж«ъ жуЏубум —у»шцецгъ ну ужуяшубхжду </div><br>  (Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord.)
