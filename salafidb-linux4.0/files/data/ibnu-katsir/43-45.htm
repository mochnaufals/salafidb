This was the view of As-Suddi and was the opinion favored by Ibn Jarir. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Encouragement to adhere to the Qur'an</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then says;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÓúÊóãúÓößú ÈöÇáøóĞöì ÃõæÍöìó Åöáóíúßó Åöäøóßó Úóáóì ÕöÑóØò ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò </div><br>  (So hold you fast to that which is revealed to you.

This means that it is an honor for them in that it was revealed in their language, so they are the people who have the best understanding of it among mankind and hence are obliged to be the most steadfast in adhering to its commandments. This is how the best of them were, the first immigrants and those who emulated them and followed them. It was also said that the meaning of the phrase;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõ áóĞößúÑñ áøóßó æóáöŞóæúãößó</div><br>  (And verily, this is indeed a Dhikr for you and your people,) was that `it was sent to remind you and your people.' The fact that they are singled out does not exclude others.

This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÈóÚóËúäóÇ İöì ßõáøö ÃõãøóÉò ÑøóÓõæáÇğ Ãóäö ÇÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáúØøóÜÛõæÊó</div><br>  (And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): "Worship Allah, and avoid all false deities.'') (16:36) Mujahid said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it: (æóÇÓúÃóáö ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ Åöáóíúåöãú ŞóÈúáóßó (ãöäú) ÑõÓõáöäóÇ) (And ask those whom We sent before you of Our Messengers.) This was narrated by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. Yet this appears to be an explanation rather than an alternate version of recitation. And Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
