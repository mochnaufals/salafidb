They will carry with them white shroud from Paradise, and fragrance for enshrouding from Paradise. They will sit as far from him as the sight goes. Then, the angel of death, will come until he sits right next to his head, saying, "O, good and pure soul! Depart (your body) to Allah's forgiveness and pleasure.'' So the soul flows (out of its body), just as the drop flows out from the tip of the jug, and the angel of death captures it. When he captures the soul, they (the group of angels) will not leave it with him for more than an instance, and they will seize it and wrap it in that shroud, and in that fragrance. A most pleasant musk scent ever found on the earth, will flow out of the soul, and the angels will ascend it (to heaven). They will not pass by, but they will say, "Whose is this Tayyib (good) soul'' They (the angels who are ascending the soul) will reply, "Such person, the son of such and such person,'' -- calling him by the best names that he used to be called in the world. They will reach the lower heaven and will ask that its door be opened for him, and it will be opened for them. The best residents of every heaven will then see him to the next heaven, until he is brought to the seventh heaven. Allah, the Exalted and Ever High, will say, "List my servants record in `Illiyyin and send him back to earth, for I have created them from it, and into it I shall return them, and from it I shall bring them out once again.'' The soul will be joined with its body, and two angels will come to him, sit him up and ask him, "Who is your Lord'' He will say, "Allah is my Lord.'' They will ask him, "What is your religion'' He will say, "My religion is Islam.'' They will say to him, "What do you say about this man (Prophet Muhammad) who was sent to you'' He will say, "He is the Messenger of Allah.'' They will ask him, "And what proof do you have about it'' He will say, "I read the Book of Allah (the Qur'an), and had faith and belief in him.'' Then, a caller (Allah) will herald from heaven, "My servant has said the truth. Therefore, furnish him from Paradise, and let him wear from (the clothes of) Paradise, and open a door for him to Paradise.'' So he is given from Paradise's tranquillity and good scent, and his grave will be expanded for him as far as his sight can reach. Then, a man, with a handsome face and handsome clothes and whose scent is pleasant, will come to him, saying, "Receive the glad tidings with that which pleases you. This is the Day which you were promised.'' He will ask him, "Who are you; for yours is the face that carries the good news'' He will reply, "I am your good works.'' He will say, "O Lord!

The angel of death will seize the soul, and when he does, they (the group of angels) will not let it stay in his hand for more than an instance, and they will wrap it in the Musuh.

He will be approached from his left, and the fast will declare, `There is no entrance from my side.' He will be approached from his feet, and the acts of righteousness will declare, `There is no entrance from our side.'

He will say, `Leave me until I pray.' He will be told, `You will pray, but first tell us what we want to know.' He will ask, `What are your questions' He will be told, `This man who was sent among you, what do you say about him and what is your testimony about him' He will ask, `Muhammad' He will be answered in the positive and he will reply, `I bear witness that he is the Messenger of Allah and that he has brought us the proofs from our Lord.
