They were also commanded to be forgiving and forbearing with the idolators and to observe patience with them at the time. However, they were eager and anticipating the time when they would be allowed to fight, so that they could punish their enemies. The situation at that time did not permit armed conflict for many reasons. For instance, Muslims were few at the time, compared to their numerous enemies. The Muslims' city was a sacred one and the most honored area on the earth, and this is why the command to fight was not revealed in Makkah. Later on when the Muslims controlled a town of their own, Al-Madinah, and had strength, power and support, Jihad was then legislated. Yet, when the command to fight was revealed, just as Muslims wished, some of them became weary and were very fearful of facing the idolators in battle.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú ÑóÈøóäóÇ áöãó ßóÊóÈúÊó ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÇáúŞöÊóÇáó áóæúáÇ ÃóÎøóÑúÊóäóÇ Åöáóì ÃóÌóáò ŞóÑöíÈò</div><br>  (They say: "Our Lord! Why have You ordained for us fighting Would that You had granted us respite for a short period'') meaning, we wish that Jihad was delayed until a later time, because it means bloodshed, orphans and widows. In a similar Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áóæúáÇó äõÒøöáóÊú ÓõæÑóÉñ İóÅöĞóÂ ÃõäÒöáóÊú ÓõæÑóÉñ ãøõÍúßóãóÉñ æóĞõßöÑó İöíåóÇ ÇáúŞöÊóÇáõ</div><br>  (Those who believe say: "Why is not a Surah sent down (for us) But when a decisive is sent down, and fighting is mentioned). Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf and several of his companions came to the Prophet while in Makkah and said, "O Allah's Prophet! We were mighty when we were pagans, but when we embraced the faith, we became weak.'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí ÃõãöÑúÊõ ÈöÇáúÚóİúæö İóáóÇ ÊõŞóÇÊöáõæÇ ÇáúŞóæúã»</div><br>  (I was commanded to pardon the people, so do not fight them.) When Allah transferred the Prophet to Al-Madinah, He commanded him to fight (the idolators), but they (some Muslims) held back. So, Allah revealed the Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑó Åöáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó Şöíáó áóåõãú ßõİøõæÇú ÃóíúÏöíóßõãú</div><br>  (Have you not seen those who were told to hold back their hands) This Hadith was collected by An-Nasa'i and Al-Hakim. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ãóÊóÜÚõ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ Şóáöíáñ æóÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉõ ÎóíúÑñ áøöãóäö ÇÊøóŞóì</div><br>  (Say: "Short is the enjoyment of this world. The Hereafter is (far) better for him who fears Allah,) means, the destination of the one who with Taqwa is better for him than this life.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊõÙúáóãõæäó İóÊöíáÇğ</div><br>  (and you shall not be dealt with unjustly even equal to the Fatil.) for your good deeds. Rather, you will earn your full rewards for them. This promise directs the focus of believers away from this life and makes them eager for the Hereafter, all the while encouraging them to fight in Jihad. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>There is No Escaping Death</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíúäóãóÇ ÊóßõæäõæÇú íõÏúÑößßøõãõ ÇáúãóæúÊõ æóáóæú ßõäÊõãú İöì ÈõÑõæÌò ãøõÔóíøóÏóÉò</div><br>  (Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high!) meaning, you shall certainly die and none of you shall ever escape death. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøõ ãóäú ÚóáóíúåóÇ İóÇäò </div><br>  (Whatsooever is on it (the earth) will perish),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøõ äóİúÓò ĞóÂÆöŞóÉõ ÇáúãóæúÊö</div><br>  (Everyone shall taste death), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ áöÈóÔóÑò ãøöä ŞóÈúáößó ÇáúÎõáúÏó</div><br>  (And We granted not to any human being immortality before you). Therefore, every soul shall taste death and nothing can save any person from it, whether he performed Jihad or not. Everyone has an appointed time, and a limited term of life. In the illness that preceded his death, Khalid bin Al-Walid said, while in his bed, "I participated in so and so number of battles, and every part of my body sustained an injury due to a stab or a shot. Yet here I am, I die in my bed! Let not the eyes of the cowards ever taste sleep.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ßõäÊõãú İöì ÈõÑõæÌò ãøõÔóíøóÏóÉò</div><br>  (even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high!) means, entrenched, fortified, high and towering. No caution or fortification can ever avert death. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Hypocrites Sense a Bad Omen Because of the Prophet !</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÊõÕöÈúåõãú ÍóÓóäóÉñ</div><br>  (And if some good reaches them) meaning, fertile years and provision of fruits, produce, children, etc., as said by Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah and As-Suddi.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõæÇú åóÜĞöåö ãöäú ÚöäÏö Çááøóåö æóÅöä ÊõÕöÈúåõãú ÓóíøöÆóÉñ</div><br>  (they say, "This is from Allah,'' but if some evil befalls them) drought, famine, shortages of fruits and produce, death that strikes their children or animals, and so forth, as Abu Al-`Aliyah and As-Suddi stated.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõæÇú åóÜĞöåö ãöäú ÚöäÏößó</div><br>  (they say, "This is from you,'') meaning, because of you and because we followed you and embraced your religion. Allah said about the people of Fir`awn,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãõ ÇáúÍóÓóäóÉõ ŞóÇáõæÇú áóäóÇ åóÜĞöåö æóÅöä ÊõÕöÈúåõãú ÓóíøöÆóÉñ íóØøóíøóÑõæÇú ÈöãõæÓóì æóãóä ãøóÚóåõ</div><br>  (But whenever good came to them, they said: "Ours is this.'' And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Musa and those with him.) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íóÚúÈõÏõ Çááøóåó Úóáóì ÍóÑúİò</div><br>  (And among mankind is he who worships Allah as it were upon the edge (i. e. in doubt)). The same is the statement uttered by the hypocrites, who embraced Islam outwardly, but disliked it inwardly. This is why when a calamity befell them, they attributed it to following the Prophet . Consequently, Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ßõáøñ ãøöäú ÚöäÏö Çááøóåö</div><br>  Say: All things are from Alla0h, Allah's statement that all things are from Him means, everything occurs by the decision and decree of Allah, and His decision shall come to pass for both the righteous and the wicked, the faithful and the disbelievers. Allah then said while addressing His Messenger , but refering to mankind in general,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÂ ÃóÕóÜÈóßó ãöäú ÍóÓóäóÉò İóãöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allah,) meaning, of Allah's bounty, favor, kindness and mercy.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÕóÜÈóßó ãöä ÓóíøöÆóÉò İóãöä äøóİúÓößó</div><br>  (But whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself.), meaning because of you and due to your actions. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÕóÜÈóßõãú ãøöä ãøõÕöíÈóÉò İóÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈóÊú ÃóíúÏöíßõãú æóíóÚúİõæÇú Úóä ßóËöíÑò </div><br>  (And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.) As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Zayd said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãöä äøóİúÓößó</div><br>  (from yourself) means, because of your errors. Qatadah said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãöä äøóİúÓößó</div><br>  (From yourself) means, as punishment for you, O son of Adam, because of your sins. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÑúÓóáúäóÜßó áöáäøóÇÓö ÑóÓõæáÇğ</div><br>  (And We have sent you as a Messenger to mankind,) so that you convey to them Allah's commandments, what He likes and is pleased with, and what He dislikes and refuses.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóİóì ÈöÇááøóåö ÔóåöíÏÇğ</div><br>  (and Allah is sufficient as a Witness.) that He has sent you. He is also Witness over you and them, having full knowledge in what you convey to them and the disbelief and rebellion with which they respond to the truth.  </div></body></html>
