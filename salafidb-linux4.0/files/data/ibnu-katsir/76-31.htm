Rather convey that which has been revealed to you from your Lord and put your trust in Allah, for verily, Allah will protect you from the people.' The Athim is the sinner in his deeds and the Kafur is the disbeliever in his heart.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇĞúßõÑö ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøößó ÈõßúÑóÉğ æóÃóÕöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And remember the Name of your Lord every morning and afternoon.) meaning, at the beginning of the day and at its end.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó Çáøóíúáö İóÇÓúÌõÏú áóåõ æóÓóÈøöÍúåõ áóíúáÇğ ØóæöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And during the night, prostrate yourself to Him, and glorify Him a long night through.)

Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others have said, "This means their creation.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÔöÆúäóÇ ÈóÏøóáúäóÂ ÃóãúËóÜáóåõãú ÊóÈúÏöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And when We will, We can replace them with others like them with a complete replacement.) meaning, `when We wish, We will resurrect them on the Day of Judgement and change them, repeating their creation in a new form.' Here the beginning of their creation is a proof for the repetition of their creation. Ibn Zayd and Ibn Jarir both said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÔöÆúäóÇ ÈóÏøóáúäóÂ ÃóãúËóÜáóåõãú ÊóÈúÏöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And when We will, We can replace them with others like them with a complete replacement.) "This means, if We wish We can bring another group of people besides them (in their place).'' This is like Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä íóÔóÃú íõĞúåöÈúßõãú ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ æóíóÃúÊö ÈöÜÇÎóÑöíäó æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì Ğáößó ŞóÏöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (If He wills, He can take you away, O people, and bring others. And Allah is capable over that.) (4:133) This is also like His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä íóÔóÃú íõĞúåöÈúßõÜãú æóíóÃúÊö ÈöÎóáúŞò ÌóÏöíÏò æóãóÇ Ğóáößó Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÈöÚóÒöíÒò </div><br>  (If He wills, He can remove you and bring a new creation! And for Allah that is not hard or difficult.) (14:19-20) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Qur'an is a Reminder, and Guidance comes from the Help of Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóÜĞöåö ÊóĞúßöÑóÉñ</div><br>  (Verily, this is an admonition,) meaning, this Surah is a reminder.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä ÔóÂÁó ÇÊøóÎóĞó Åöáóì ÑóÈøöåö ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (so whosoever wills, let him take a path to his Lord.) meaning, a path and a way. This means, whoever wishes to be guided by the Qur'an. This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇĞóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú áóæú ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö æóÇáúíóæúãö ÇáÇøñÎöÑö</div><br>  (And what loss have they if they had believed in Allah and in the Last Day.) (4:39) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊóÔóÂÁõæäó ÅöáÇøó Ãóä íóÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (But you cannot will, unless Allah wills.) meaning, no one is able to guide himself, enter into faith or bring about any benefit for himself,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Ãóä íóÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ Åöäøó Çááøóåó ßóÇäó ÚóáöíãÇğ ÍóßöíãÇğ</div><br>  (Unless Allah wills. Verily, Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.) meaning, He is Most Knowledgeable of who deserves to be guided. So, He makes guidance easy for him and He predestines for him that which will be a cause for it. However, whoever deserves misguidance, He averts guidance from him. Unto Him belongs the most excellent wisdom and the most irrefutable argument. Thus, He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ßóÇäó ÚóáöíãÇğ ÍóßöíãÇğ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.) Then He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÏúÎöáõ ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ İöì ÑóÍúãóÊöåö æóÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó ÃóÚóÏøó áóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈÇğ ÃóáöíãÇğ </div><br>  (He will admit to His mercy whom He wills and as for the wrongdoers -- He has prepared a painful torment.) meaning, He guides whomever He wishes and He leads astray whomever He wishes. Whoever He guides, there is no one who can lead him astray; and whoever He leads astray, there is no one who can guide him. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Insan. And all praise and thanks are due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
