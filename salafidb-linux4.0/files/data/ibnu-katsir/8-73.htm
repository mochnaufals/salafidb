In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim recorded that Usamah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóÊóæóÇÑóËõ Ãóåúáõ ãöáøóÊóíúäö¡ æóáóÇ íóÑöËõ ãõÓúáöãñ ßóÇİöÑğÇ¡ æóáóÇ ßóÇİöÑñ ãõÓúáöãğÇ»</div><br>  (No followers of two religions inherit from each other. Therefore, neither a Muslim inherits from a disbeliever nor a disbeliever from a Muslim.)  The Prophet recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÈóÚúÖõåõãú ÃóæúáöíóÂÁõ ÈóÚúÖò ÅöáÇøó ÊóİúÚóáõæåõ Êóßõäú İöÊúäóÉñ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóİóÓóÇÏñ ßóÈöíÑñ </div><br>  (And those who disbelieve are supporters of one another, (and) if you (Muslims) do not do so (protect one another), there will be Fitnah on the earth, and great corruption.) Al-Hakim said, "Its chain is Sahih, and they did not record it.'' However, the following, from Usamah bin Zayd, is in the Two Sahihs; the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóÑöËõ ÇáúãõÓúáöãõ ÇáúßóÇİöÑó æóáóÇ ÇáúßóÇİöÑõ ÇáúãõÓúáöã»</div><br>  (Neither a Muslim inherits from a disbeliever nor a disbeliever inherits from a Muslim.)  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÊóİúÚóáõæåõ Êóßõäú İöÊúäóÉñ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóİóÓóÇÏñ ßóÈöíÑñ</div><br>  (If you do not do so, there will be Fitnah and oppression on the earth, and a great corruption), meaning, if you do not shun the idolators and offer your loyalty to the believers, Fitnah will overcome the people. Then confusion polytheism and corruption will be rampant, for the believers will be mixed with disbelievers, resulting in tremendous, widespread trials corruption and mischief between people.  </div></body></html>
