Therefore, do not be saddened by this fact. Allah said in other Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ßõĞøöÈóÊú ÑõÓõáñ ãøöä ŞóÈúáößó İóÕóÈóÑõæÇú Úóáóì ãóÇ ßõĞøöÈõæÇú æóÃõæĞõæÇú</div><br>  (Verily, Messengers were denied before you, but with patience they bore the denial, and they were hurt...) 6:34, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ íõŞóÇáõ áóßó ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ŞóÏú Şöíáó áöáÑøõÓõáö ãöä ŞóÈúáößó Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó áóĞõæ ãóÛúİöÑóÉó æóĞõæ ÚöŞóÇÈò Ãóáöíãò </div><br>  (Nothing is said to you except what was said to the Messengers before you.

Waraqah bin Nawfal said to Allah's Messenger , "None came with what you came with but he was the subject of enmity.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÔóíóÜØöíäó ÇáÅöäúÓö</div><br>  (Shayatin among mankind...) refers to,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÏõæøğÇ</div><br>  (enemies. ..) meaning, the Prophets have enemies among the devils of mankind and the devils of the Jinns. The word, Shaytan, describes one who is dissimilar to his kind due to his or her wickedness. Indeed, only the Shayatin, may Allah humiliate and curse them, from among mankind and the Jinns oppose the Messengers. `Abdur-Razzaq said that Ma`mar narrated that Qatadah commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÔóíóÜØöíäó ÇáÅöäúÓö æóÇáúÌöäøö</div><br>  (Shayatin (devils) among mankind and Jinn...) "There are devils among the Jinns and devils among mankind who inspire each other.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõæÍöì ÈóÚúÖõåõãú Åöáóì ÈóÚúÖò ÒõÎúÑõİó ÇáúŞóæúáö ÛõÑõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion.) means, they inspire each other with beautified, adorned speech that deceives the ignorant who hear it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó ÑóÈøõßó ãóÇ İóÚóáõæåõ</div><br>  (If your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it;) for all this occurs by Allah's decree, will and decision, that every Prophet had enemies from these devils,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞóÑúåõãú æóãóÇ íóİúÊóÑõæäó</div><br>  (so leave them alone with their fabrications.) and lies. This Ayah orders patience in the face of the harm of the wicked and to trust in Allah against their enmity, for, "Allah shall suffice for you (O Muhammad) and aid you against them.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöÊóÕúÛóì Åöáóíúåö</div><br>  (And Tasgha to it.) means, according to Ibn `Abbas, "incline to it.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİúÆöÏóÉõ ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö</div><br>  (the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter...) their hearts, mind and hearing. As-Suddi said that this Ayah refers to the hearts of the disbelievers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöíóÑúÖóæúåõ</div><br>  (And that they may remain pleased with it.) they like and adore it. Only those who disbelieve in the Hereafter accept this evil speech, being enemies of the Prophets, etc., just as Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóßõãú æóãóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó - ãóÂ ÃóäÊõãú Úóáóíúåö ÈöİóÜÊöäöíäó - ÅöáÇøó ãóäú åõæó ÕóÇáö ÇáúÌóÍöíãö </div><br>  (So, verily, you (pagans) and those whom you worship (idols). Cannot lead astray. Except those who are predestined to burn in Hell!) 37:161-163 and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßõãú áóİöì Şóæúáò ãøõÎúÊóáöİò - íõÄúİóßõ Úóäúåõ ãóäú Ãõİößó </div><br>  (Certainly, you have different ideas. Turned aside therefrom is he who is turned aside.) 51:8-9 Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöíóŞúÊóÑöİõæÇú ãóÇ åõã ãøõŞúÊóÑöİõæäó</div><br>  (And that they may commit what they are committing. ) meaning, "let them earn whatever they will earn'', according to `Ali bin Abi Talhah who reported this from Ibn `Abbas. As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd also commented, "Let them do whatever they will do.''  </div></body></html>
