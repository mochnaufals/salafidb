Rather, they will be a people who will be punished by the Fire due to their sins. It will be gradually killing them and devouring them until they become burnt coals. Then, intercession will be allowed and they will be brought (out of Hell) group by group and they will be spread on the rivers of Paradise. It will then be said, "O people of Paradise, pour (water) over them.'' Then, they will start to grow like the growing of a seed on the muddy banks of a flowing river.) A man among the people said, "It is as if the Messenger of Allah lived in the desert.'' This is how Muslim recorded this narration in his Sahih. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÃúÊöåö ãõÄúãöäÇğ ŞóÏú Úóãöáó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö</div><br>  (But whoever comes to Him (Allah) as a believer, and has done righteous good deeds,) whoever meets his Lord on the Day of Judgment as a believer in his heart, then verily, his intentions in his heart will be affirmed to be true by his statements and deeds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó áóåõãõ ÇáÏøóÑóÌóÜÊõ ÇáúÚõáóì</div><br>  (for such are the high ranks,) Paradise, which has the highest levels, the most tranquil rooms and the nicest homes. Imam Ahmad reported from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÌóäøóÉõ ãöÇÆóÉõ ÏóÑóÌóÉò ãóÇ Èóíúäó ßõáøö ÏóÑóÌóÊóíúäö ßóãóÇ Èóíúäó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ æóÇáúİöÑúÏóæúÓõ ÃóÚúáóÇåóÇ ÏóÑóÌóÉğ¡ æóãöäúåóÇ ÊóÎúÑõÌõ ÇáúÃóäúåóÇÑõ ÇáúÃóÑúÈóÚóÉõ¡ æóÇáúÚóÑúÔõ İóæúŞóåóÇ¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ÓóÃóáúÊõãõ Çááåó İóÇÓúÃóáõæåõ ÇáúİöÑúÏóæúÓ»</div><br>  (Paradise has one hundred levels and between each level is a distance like the distance between the sky and the earth. Al-Firdaws is the name of the highest of its levels. From it springs the four rivers and the Throne is above it. Therefore, when you ask Allah, then ask Him for Al-Firdaws.) This narration was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi. In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Ãóåúáó Úöáøöíøöíäó áóíóÑóæúäó ãóäú İóæúŞóåõãú ßóãóÇ ÊóÑóæúäó ÇáúßóæúßóÈó ÇáúÛóÇÈöÑó İöí ÃõİõŞö ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö áöÊóİóÇÖõáö ãóÇ Èóíúäóåõãú ŞóÇáõæÇ: íóÇ ÑóÓõæáó Çááåö Êöáúßó ãóäóÇÒöáõ ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁö ŞóÇáó: Èóáì¡ æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö ÑöÌóÇáñ ÂãóäõæÇ ÈöÇááåö æóÕóÏøóŞõæÇ ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíä»</div><br>  (Verily, the people of the `Illiyyin will see those who are above them just as you see the fading star in the horizon of the sky, due to the different status of virtue between them. ) The people said, "O Messenger of Allah, these are the dwellings of the Prophets.'' He replied, (Of course. And I swear by the One Whom my soul is in His Hand, (it is for) men who had faith in Allah and they believed the Messengers.) In the Sunan collections this narration is mentioned with the additional wording,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÅöäøó ÃóÈóÇ ÈóßúÑò æóÚõãóÑó áóãöäúåõãú æóÃóäúÚóãóÇ»</div><br>  (And verily Abu Bakr and `Umar are of them and they will be most favored.) His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌóäøóÜÊö ÚóÏúäò</div><br>  (Adn Gardens,) meaning established as a residence. It is merely used here in reference to the high ranks mentioned previously.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÇ ÇáÇøñäúåóÇÑõ ÎóÜÇáöÏöíäó İöíåóÇ</div><br>  (under which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever,) meaning that they will abide in it for eternity.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóĞáößó ÌóÒóÂÁõ ãóä ÊóÒóßøóì</div><br>  (and such is the reward of those who purify themselves.) One who purifies himself from dirt, filth and associating partners with Allah. This is the person who worships Allah alone, without ascribing partners to Him, and he follows the Messengers in the good they came with all that they claim.  </div></body></html>
