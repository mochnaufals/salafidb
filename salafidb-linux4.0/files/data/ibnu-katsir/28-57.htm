(12:103) This Ayah is even more specific than the following:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßó áÇó ÊóåúÏöì ãóäú ÃóÍúÈóÈúÊó æóáóÜßöäøó Çááøóåó íóåúÏöì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ æóåõæó ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöÇáúãõåúÊóÏöíäó </div><br>  (Verily, you guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He knows best those who are the guided.) meaning: Allah knows best who deserves to be guided and who deserves to be misguided. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that this Ayah was revealed concerning Abu Talib, the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah . He used to protect the Prophet, support him and stand by him. He loved the Prophet dearly, but this love was a natural love, i.e., born of kinship, not a love that was born of the fact that he was the Messenger of Allah . When he was on his deathbed, the Messenger of Allah called him to Faith and to enter Islam, but the decree overtook him and he remained a follower of disbelief, and Allah's is the complete wisdom. Az-Zuhri said: "Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib narrated to me that his father, Al-Musayyib bin Hazan Al-Makhzumi, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "When Abu Talib was dying, the Messenger of Allah came to him and found Abu Jahl bin Hisham and `Abdullah bin Abi Umayyah bin Al-Mughirah with him. The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ Úóãøö Şõáú: áóÇ Åöáóåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ¡ ßóáöãóÉğ ÃõÍóÇÌøõ áóßó ÈöåóÇ ÚöäúÏó Çááå»</div><br>  (O my uncle, say La ilaha illallah, a word which I may use as evidence in your favor before Allah in the Hereafter.) Abu Jahl bin Hisham and `Abdullah bin Abi Umayyah said: `O Abu Talib, will you leave the religion of `Abdul-Muttalib' The Messenger of Allah kept urging him to say La ilaha illallah, and they kept saying, `Will you leave the religion of `Abdul-Muttalib' -- until, at the very end, he said that he was on the religion of `Abdul-Muttalib, and he refused to say La ilaha illallah. The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇááåö áóÃóÓúÊóÛúİöÑóäøó áóßó ãóÇ áóãú Ãõäúåó Úóäúß»</div><br>  (By Allah, I shall certainly seek forgiveness for you unless I am told not to.)

And there was revealed concerning Abu Talib the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßó áÇó ÊóåúÏöì ãóäú ÃóÍúÈóÈúÊó æóáóÜßöäøó Çááøóåó íóåúÏöì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (Verily, you guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills.)'' This was recorded (by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Hadith of Az-Zuhri. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Excuses made by the People of Makkah for not believing, and the Refutation of Their Excuses</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú Åöä äøóÊøóÈöÚö ÇáúåõÏóì ãóÚóßó äõÊóÎóØøóİú ãöäú ÃóÑúÖöäóÂ</div><br>  (And they say: "If we follow the guidance with you, we would be snatched away from our land.'') Allah tells us that this is the excuse which was given by some of the disbelievers for not following true guidance. They said to the Messenger of Allah :   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä äøóÊøóÈöÚö ÇáúåõÏóì ãóÚóßó äõÊóÎóØøóİú ãöäú ÃóÑúÖöäóÂ</div><br>  (If we follow the guidance with you, we would be snatched away from our land.), meaning, `we are afraid that if we follow the message of guidance that you have brought, and go against the pagan Arab tribes around us, they will seek to do us harm and wage war against us, and they may snatch us away from wherever we may be.' Allah said in response to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæóáóãú äõãóßøöä áøóåõãú ÍóÑóãÇğ ÁóÇãöäÇğ</div><br>  (Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary,) meaning, the excuse they give is a lie and is false, because Allah has put them in a secure city and a venerated sanctuary which has been safe from the time it was built -- how could this sanctuary be safe for them when they believed in disbelief and Shirk, and how could it not be safe for them when they become Muslims and follow the truth   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÌúÈóì Åöáóíúåö ËóãóÑóÇÊõ ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (to which are brought fruits of all kinds, ) means, all kinds of fruits from the surrounding regions, from At-Ta'if and elsewhere. Similarly, the people of Makkah engaged in trade and other goods also came to their city.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøöÒúŞÇğ ãøöä áøóÏõäøóÇ æóáóÜßöäøó ÃóßúËóÑóåõãú áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (a provision from Ourselves, but most of them know not.) - this is why they said what they said.  </div></body></html>
