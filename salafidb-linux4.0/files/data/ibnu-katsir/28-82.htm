This was also reported in the Sahih by Al-Bukhari from Salim, who said that his father told him that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóíúäóãóÇ ÑóÌõáñ íóÌõÑøõ ÅöÒóÇÑóåõ ÅöĞú ÎõÓöİó Èöåö¡ İóåõæó íóÊóÌóáúÌóáõ İöí ÇáúÃóÑúÖö Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (While a man was dragging his lower garment, he was swallowed up and he will remain sinking down into the earth until the Day of Resurrection.) He also recorded something similar from Salim from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet . Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóíúäóãóÇ ÑóÌõáñ İöíãóäú ßóÇäó ŞóÈúáóßõãú ÎóÑóÌó İöí ÈõÑúÏóíúäö ÃóÎúÖóÑóíúäö íóÎúÊóÇáõ İöíåöãóÇ¡ ÃóãóÑó Çááåõ ÇáúÃóÑúÖó İóÃóÎóĞóÊúåõ¡ İóÅöäøóåõ áóíóÊóÌóáúÌóáõ İöíåóÇ Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (When a man among the people who came before you went out wearing two green garments, walking proudly and arrogantly, Allah commanded the earth to swallow him up, and he will remain sinking down into it until the Day of Resurrection.)  This version was recorded only by Ahmad, and its chain of narration is Hasan (sound).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ßóÇäó áóåõ ãöä İöÆóÉò íóäÕõÑõæäóåõ ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ãöäó ÇáúãõäÊóÕöÑöíäó</div><br>  (Then he had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves.) means, his wealth, group, servants and retinue were of no avail to him; they could not protect him from the wrath and vengeance of Allah. Nor could he help himself or save himself. There was no one to help him, neither himself nor anybody else. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>His People learned a Lesson from Him being swallowed up</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÕúÈóÍó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóãóäøóæúÇú ãóßóÇäóåõ ÈöÇáÇøñãúÓö</div><br>  (And those who had desired his position the day before,) means, those witnessed him with his finery and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÑöíÏõæäó ÇáúÍóíóæÉó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ íáóíúÊó áóäóÇ ãöËúáó ãóÂ ÃõæÊöìó ŞóÜÑõæäõ Åöäøóåõ áóĞõæ ÍóÙøò ÚóÙöíãò</div><br>  (Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: "Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given!

Wealth does not indicate that Allah is pleased with its owner, for Allah gives and withholds, allows times of difficulty and times of ease, raises and lowers, His is the most complete wisdom and most convincing proof.
