These clear signs were: his staff, his hand, the years of famine, the sea, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs and the blood. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, "They were his hand and his staff, the five signs mentioned in Al-A`raf, and destruction of wealth and the rock.'' Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Ash-Sha`bi and Qatadah said: "They are his hand, his staff, the years of famine, the failure of the crops, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs and the blood.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÓúÊóßúÈóÑõæÇú æóßóÇäõæÇú ŞóæúãÇğ ãøõÌúÑöãöíäó</div><br>  (Yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals,) 7:133 meaning, despite all these signs and their witnessing of them, they disbelieved them and belied them wrongfully and arrogantly, although they were themselves were convinced of them, so they did not have any effect on them. By the same token, (Allah tells His Messenger here,) `if We were to respond to what these people are asking you for, who have said that they will not believe in you until you cause springs to gush forth throughout the land for them, they would not respond or believe except if Allah willed.' As Fira`wn said to Musa, even though he had witnessed the signs which he brought,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì áÃóÙõäøõßó íãõæÓóì ãóÓúÍõæÑğÇ</div><br>  ("O Musa! I think you are indeed bewitched. '') It was said that this meant he thought he was a sorcerer, but Allah knows best. These nine signs which were mentioned by the Imams (scholars) quoted above are what is referred to here, and in the Ayah :   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóáúŞö ÚóÕóÇßó İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÁóÇåóÇ ÊóåúÊóÒøõ ßóÃóäøóåóÇ ÌóÂäøñ æóáøóì ãõÏúÈöÑÇğ æóáóãú íõÚóŞøöÈú íãõæÓóì áÇó ÊóÎóİú</div><br>  ("And throw down your stick!'' But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight, and did not look back. (It was said:) "O Musa ! Fear not.'') until His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÊöÓúÚö ÁóÇíóÜÊò Åöáóì İöÑúÚóæúäó æóŞóæúãöåö Åöäøóåõãú ßóÇäõæÇú ŞóæúãÇğ İóÜÓöŞöíäó</div><br>  (among the nine signs (you will take) to Fir`awn and his people. Verily, they are a people who are rebellious.) 27:10-12 These Ayat include mention of the stick and the hand, and the rest of the nine signs are mentioned in detail in Surat Al-A`raf. Musa was also given many other signs, such as striking the rock with his staff and water flowing from it, their being shaded with clouds, manna and quails, and other signs which were bestowed upon the Children of Israel after they had left the land of Egypt. But here Allah mentions the nine signs which were witnessed by his people in Egypt. These became evidence against them, because they stubbornly rejected them out of disbelief.  So Musa said to Fira`wn:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÚóáöãúÊó ãóÂ ÃóäÒóáó åóÜÄõáÇÁö ÅöáÇøó ÑóÈøõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÈóÕóÂÆöÑó</div><br>  ("Verily, you know that these signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth. ) meaning, as proof and evidence of the truth of what I have brought to you.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøöì áÃóÙõäøõßó íİöÑúÚóæäõ ãóËúÈõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (And I think you are indeed, O Fir`awn, doomed to destruction!) i.e., bound to be destroyed. This was the view of Mujahid and Qatadah. Ibn `Abbas said: "It means cursed.'' Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóËúÈõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (doomed to destruction.) means defeated. As Mujahid said, "doomed'' includes all of these meanings. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Destruction of Fir`awn and His People</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÑóÇÏó Ãóä íóÓúÊóİöÒøóåõã ãøöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (So he resolved to turn them out of the land.) means, he wanted to expel them and drive them out.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÛúÑóŞúäóÇåõ æóãóä ãøóÚóåõ ÌóãöíÚğÇæóŞõáúäóÇ ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåö áöÈóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó ÇÓúßõäõæÇú ÇáÇøñÑúÖó</div><br>  (But We drowned him and all who were with him. And We said to the Children of Israel after him: "Dwell in the land...'') This is good news for Muhammad , a foretelling of the conquest of Makkah, even though this Surah was revealed in Makkah before the Hijrah. Similarly, the people of Makkah wanted to expel the Prophet from the city, as Allah says in two Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ßóÇÏõæÇú áóíóÓúÊóİöÒøõæäóßó ãöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö áöíõÎúÑöÌõæßó ãöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (And verily, they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land...) 17:76-77 Hence Allah caused His Messenger to inherit Makkah, so he entered it by force, according to the better-known of the two opinions, and he defeated its people then out of kindness and generosity, he let them go, just as Allah caused the Children of Israel, who had been oppressed, to inherit the land, east and west, and to inherit the land of Fir`awn's people, with its farmland, crops and treasures. As Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó æóÃóæúÑóËúäóÜåóÇ Èóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó </div><br>  (thus We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them. ) (26:59). Here Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõáúäóÇ ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåö áöÈóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó ÇÓúßõäõæÇú ÇáÇøñÑúÖó İóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁó æóÚúÏõ ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö ÌöÆúäóÇ Èößõãú áóİöíİğÇ </div><br>  (And We said to the Children of Israel after him: "Dwell in the land, then, when the final and the last promise comes near, We shall bring you altogether as mixed crowd.'') meaning, all of you, you and your ene mies. Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak said, "It means all together.''  </div></body></html>
