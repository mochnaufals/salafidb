For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ËóãõæÏõ İóåóÏóíúäóÜåõãú</div><br>  (And as for Thamud, We showed and made clear to them the path of truth ...) 41:17. Mujahid commented on Allah's saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó Çááøóåõ áöíõÖöáøó ŞóæúãÇğ ÈóÚúÏó ÅöĞú åóÏóÇåõãú</div><br>  (And Allah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them) "Allah the Mighty and Sublime is clarifying to the believers about not seeking forgiveness for the idolators in particular, and in general, it is an exhortation to beware of disobeying Him, and encouragement to obey Him. So either do or suffer.'' Ibn Jarir commented, "Allah says that He would not direct you to misguidance, so that you invoke Him for forgiveness for your dead idolators, after He gave you guidance and directed you to believe in Him and in His Messenger ! First, He will inform you of what you should avoid, so that you avoid it. Before He informs you that this action is not allowed, you would not have disobeyed Him and fallen into what He prohibited for you if you indulge in this action. Therefore, in this case, He will not allow you to be misguided. Verily, guidance or misguidance occurs after commands and prohibitions are established. As for those who were neither commanded nor prohibited, they can neither be obedient nor disobedient in doing what they were neither ordered nor prohibited from doing.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó áóåõ ãõáúßõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö íõÍúìö æóíõãöíÊõ æóãóÇ áóßõãú ãøöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ãöä æóáöìøò æóáÇó äóÕöíÑò </div><br>  (Indeed to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, He gives life and He causes death. And besides Allah you have neither any protector nor any helper.) Ibn Jarir commented, "This is an encouragement from Allah for His believing servants to fight the idolators and chiefs of disbelief. It is also a command for them to trust in Allah's aid, for He is the Owner of the heavens and earth, and not to fear His enemies. Verily, they have no protector besides Allah, nor a supporter other than Him.''  </div></body></html>
