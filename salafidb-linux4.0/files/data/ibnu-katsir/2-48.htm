And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from him, nor will compensation be taken from him, nor will they be helped.)</div>  After Allah reminded the Children of Israel of the favors that He has granted them, He warned them about the duration of the torment which He will punish them with on the Day of Resurrection. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú íóæúãğÇ</div><br>  (And fear a Day) meaning, the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó ÊóÌúÒöì äóİúÓñ Úóä äøóİúÓò ÔóíúÆğÇ</div><br>  (When a person shall not avail another) meaning, on that Day, no person shall be of any help to another. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÒöÑõ æóÇÒöÑóÉñ æöÒúÑó ÃõÎúÑóì</div><br>  (And no bearer of burdens shall bear another's burden) (35:18)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áößõáøö ÇãúÑöìÁò ãøöäúåõãú íóæúãóÆöĞò ÔóÃúäñ íõÛúäöíåö </div><br>  (Every man that Day will have enough to make him careless of others.) (80:37) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÇÊøóŞõæÇú ÑóÈøóßõãú æóÇÎúÔóæúÇú íóæúãÇğ áÇøó íóÌúÒöì æóÇáöÏñ Úóä æóáóÏöåö æóáÇó ãóæúáõæÏñ åõæó ÌóÇÒò Úóä æóÇáöÏöåö ÔóíúÆÇğ</div><br>  (O mankind! Have Taqwa of your Lord (by keeping your duty to Him and avoiding all evil), and fear a Day when no father can avail aught for his son, nor a son avail aught for his father) (31: 33).  This indeed should serve as a great warning that both the father and the son will not be of help to each other on that Day. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Neither Intercession, Ransom, or Assistance will be accepted on behalf of the Disbelievers</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõŞúÈóáõ ãöäúåóÇ ÔóİóÜÚóÉñ</div><br>  (nor will intercession be accepted from him)  meaning, from the disbelievers. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ÊóäİóÚõåõãú ÔóİóÜÚóÉõ ÇáÔøóÜİöÚöíäó </div><br>  (So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them) (74:48) and described the people of the Fire saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ áóäóÇ ãöä ÔóÜİöÚöíäó - æóáÇó ÕóÏöíŞò Íóãöíãò </div><br>  (Now we have no intercessors.

Allah's statement here (2:48)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõÄúÎóĞõ ãöäúåóÇ ÚóÏúáñ</div><br>  (nor will compensation be taken from him) means, that Allah does not accept the disbelievers to ransom themselves. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóãóÇÊõæÇú æóåõãú ßõİøóÇÑñ İóáóä íõŞúÈóáó ãöäú ÃóÍóÏöåöã ãøöáúÁõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ĞóåóÈğÇ æóáóæö ÇİúÊóÏóì Èöåö</div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them even if they offered it as a ransom) (3:91)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú áóæú Ãóäøó áóåõãú ãøóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÌóãöíÚÇğ æóãöËúáóåõ ãóÚóåõ áöíóİúÊóÏõæÇú Èöåö ãöäú ÚóĞóÇÈö íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö ãóÇ ÊõŞõÈøöáó ãöäúåõãú æóáóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ </div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves from the torment on the Day of Resurrection, it would never be accepted of them, and theirs would be a painful torment) (5:36)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÊóÚúÏöáú ßõáøó ÚóÏúáò áÇøó íõÄúÎóĞú ãöäúåóÂ</div><br>  (And even if he offers every ransom, it will not be accepted from him) (6:70) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇáúíóæúãó áÇó íõÄúÎóĞõ ãöäßõãú İöÏúíóÉñ æóáÇó ãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ãóÃúæóÇßõãõ ÇáäøóÇÑõ åöìó ãóæúáóÜßõãú</div><br>  (So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you (hypocrites), nor of those who disbelieved. Your abode is the Fire. That is your Mawla (friend Ü proper place)) (57:15).  Allah stated that if the people do not believe in His Messenger and follow what He sent him with, then when they meet Him on the Day of Resurrection, after remaining on the path of disbelief, their family lineage and/or the intercession of their masters will not help them at all. It will not be accepted of them, even if they paid the earth's fill of gold as ransom. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä íóÃúÊöìó íóæúãñ áÇøó ÈóíúÚñ İöíåö æóáÇó ÎõáøóÉñ æóáÇó ÔóİóÜÚóÉñ</div><br>  (Before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession) (2:254) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó ÈóíúÚñ İöíåö æóáÇó ÎöáóÜáñ</div><br>  (On which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending) (19:31). Allah's statement next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó åõãú íõäÕóÑõæäó</div><br>  (nor will they be helped.) means, "no person shall get angry - or anxious - on their behalf and offer them any help, or try to save them from Allah's punishment.'' As stated earlier on that Day, neither the relative, nor persons of authority will feel pity for the disbelievers, nor will any ransom be accepted for them. Consequently, they will receive no help from others and they will be helpless themsleves. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó íõÌúíöÑõ æóáÇó íõÌóÇÑõ Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (While He (Allah) grants refuge (or protection), but none grants refuge from Him) (23:88)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíóæúãóÆöĞò áÇøó íõÚóĞøöÈõ ÚóĞóÇÈóåõ ÃóÍóÏñ - æóáÇó íõæËöŞõ æóËóÇŞóåõ ÃóÍóÏñ </div><br>  (So on that Day none will punish as He will punish. And none will bind (the wicked, disbelievers and polytheists) as He will bind) (89:25-26)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ áóßõãú áÇó ÊóäóÜÕóÑõæäó - Èóáú åõãõ Çáúíóæúãó ãõÓúÊóÓúáöãõæäó </div><br>  ("What is the matter with you Why do you not help one another (as you used to do in the world)'' Nay, but that Day they shall surrender) (37:25-26) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóæúáÇó äóÕóÑóåõãõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÊøóÎóĞõæÇú ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ŞõÑúÈóÇäÇğ ÁóÇáöåóÉó Èóáú ÖóáøõæÇú Úóäúåõãú</div><br>  (Then why did those whom they had taken for alihah (gods) besides Allah, as a way of approach (to Allah) not help them Nay, but they vanished completely from them) (46:28).  Also, Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ áóßõãú áÇó ÊóäóÜÕóÑõæäó </div><br>  ("What is the matter with you Why do you not help one another'') (37:25) means, "This Day, you shall not have a refuge from Us. Not this Day.'' Ibn Jarir said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó åõãú íõäÕóÑõæäó</div><br>  (nor will they be helped.) meaning, on that Day, they shall neither be helped by any helper, nor shall anyone intercede on their behalf. No repeal or ransom will be accepted for them, all courtesy towards them will have ceased, along with any helpful intercession. No type of help or cooperation will be available for them on that Day. The judgment will, on that Day, be up to the Most Great, the Most Just, against whom no intercessor or helper can ever assist. He will then award the evil deed its kind and will multiply the good deeds. This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞöİõæåõãú Åöäøóåõãú ãøóÓúÆõæáõæäó - ãóÇ áóßõãú áÇó ÊóäóÜÕóÑõæäó - Èóáú åõãõ Çáúíóæúãó ãõÓúÊóÓúáöãõæäó </div><br>  (But stop them, verily, they are to be questioned. "What is the matter with you Why do you not help one another'' Nay, but that Day they shall surrender) (37:24-26).  </div></body></html>
