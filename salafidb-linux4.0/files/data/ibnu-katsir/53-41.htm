Similar was said by Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and several others. `Ikrimah and Sa`id said: "Like the case of a people who dig a well, during the course of which they find a rock preventing them from completing their work. So they say, `We are finished' and they abandon the work.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İÃóÚöäÏóåõ Úöáúãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö İóåõæó íóÑóì </div><br>  (Is with him the knowledge of the Unseen so that he sees) means, does this person, who stopped giving for fear of poverty and ended his acts of charity have knowledge of the Unseen and thus knows that if he does not stop giving, his wealth will go away No. Such a person has stopped giving in charity for righteous causes and did not keep relations with kith and kin because of his miserliness, being stingy and out of fear of poverty. The Prophet said in a Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúİöŞú ÈöáóÇáõ¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÎúÔó ãöäú Ğöí ÇáúÚóÑúÔö ÅöŞúáóÇáğÇ»</div><br>  (O Bilal, spend and fear not less provisions from the Owner of the Thone.)

Ibn `Abbas said about:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİøóì</div><br>  (fulfilled) "He delivered all that Allah ordered him to deliver.'' Sa`id bin Jubayr said about:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİøóì</div><br>  (fulfilled), "What he was ordered.'' Qatadah said about:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİøóì</div><br>  (fulfilled), "He obeyed Allah and delivered His Message to His creatures.'' This is the view preferred by Ibn Jarir because it includes the statement before it and supports it. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞö ÇÈúÊóáóì ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó ÑóÈøõåõ ÈößóáöãóÜÊò İóÃóÊóãøóåõäøó ŞóÇáó Åöäøöì ÌóÜÚöáõßó áöáäøóÇÓö ÅöãóÇãğÇ</div><br>  (And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim tried him with (certain) commands, which he fulfilled. He said: "Verily, I am going to make you an Imam (a leader) for mankind.'')(2:124) Therefore, Ibrahim fulfilled all the commands of his Lord, stayed away from all the prohibitions, and conveyed Allah's Message in its entirety. Therefore, he is worthy of being made a leader for mankind in all of his affairs, statements and actions. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÃóæúÍóíúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó Ãóäö ÇÊøóÈöÚú ãöáøóÉó ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó ÍóäöíİğÇ æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ãöäó ÇáúãõÔúÑößöíäó </div><br>  (Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): "Follow the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.'')(16:123) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>None shall carry the Burden of Any Other on the Day of Resurrection</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted explained what He has revealed in the Scripture of Ibrahim and Musa,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇøó ÊóÒöÑõ æóÒöÑóÉñ æöÒúÑó ÃõÎúÑóì </div><br>  (That no burdened person shall bear the burden of another.) Meaning, every soul shall carry its own injustices, whether disbelief or sin, and none else shall carry its burden of sin, as Allah states   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÊóÏúÚõ ãõËúŞóáóÉñ Åöáóì ÍöãúáöåóÇ áÇó íõÍúãóáú ãöäúåõ ÔóìúÁñ æóáóæú ßóÇäó ĞóÇ ŞõÑúÈóì</div><br>  (And if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin.)(35:18) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóä áøóíúÓó áöáÅöäÓóÜäö ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ÓóÚóì </div><br>  (And that man can have nothing but what he does.) So just as no soul shall carry the burden of any other, the soul shall only benefit from the good that one earns for himself. As for the Hadith recorded by Muslim in the Sahih, that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ãóÇÊó ÇáúÅöäúÓóÇäõ ÇäúŞóØóÚó Úóãóáõåõ ÅöáøóÇ ãöäú ËóáóÇËò: ãöäú æóáóÏò ÕóÇáöÍò íóÏúÚõæ áóåõ¡ Ãóæú ÕóÏóŞóÉò ÌóÇÑöíóÉò ãöäú ÈóÚúÏöåö¡ Ãóæú Úöáúãò íõäúÊóİóÚõ Èöå»</div><br>  (When a person dies, his deeds will cease except in three cases: from a righteous son who invokes Allah for him, or an ongoing charity after his death, or knowledge that people benefit from.) These three things are, in reality, a result of one's own deeds, efforts and actions. For example, a Hadith states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÃóØúíóÈó ãóÇ Ãóßóáó ÇáÑøóÌõáõ ãöäú ßóÓúÈöåö¡ æóÅöäøó æóáóÏóåõ ãöäú ßóÓúÈöå»</div><br>  (Verily, the best type of provision that one consumes is from what he himself has earned, and one's offspring are among what he has earned.) The ongoing charity that one leaves behind, like an endowment, for example, are among the traces of his own actions and deeds. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ äóÍúäõ äõÍúìö ÇáúãóæúÊóì æóäóßúÊõÈõ ãóÇó ŞóÏøóãõæÇú æóÁóÇËóÇÑóåõãú</div><br>  (Verily, We give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before (them) and their traces.)(36:12) The knowledge that one spreads among people which they are guided by is among his actions and deeds. A Hadith collected in the Sahih states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÏóÚóÇ Åöáóì åõÏğì ßóÇäó áóåõ ãöäó ÇáúÃóÌúÑö ãöËúáõ ÃõÌõæÑö ãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚóåõ¡ ãöäú ÛóíúÑö Ãóäú íóäúŞõÕó ãöäú ÃõÌõæÑöåöãú ÔóíúÆğÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever invites to guidance, he will earn as much reward as those who follow him, without decreasing anything out of their own rewards.) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó ÓóÚúíóåõ Óóæúİó íõÑóì </div><br>  (And that his deeds will be seen.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõáö ÇÚúãóáõæÇú İóÓóíóÑóì Çááøóåõ Úóãóáóßõãú æóÑóÓõæáõåõ æóÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó æóÓóÊõÑóÏøõæäó Åöáóì ÚóÜáöãö ÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÇáÔøóåóÜÏóÉö İóíõäóÈøöÆõßõãú ÈöãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (And say: "Do deeds! Allah will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger and the believers. And you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen.

Allah's statement here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó íõÌúÒóÇåõ ÇáúÌóÒóÂÁó ÇáÃóæúİóì </div><br>  (Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best recompense.)  </div></body></html>
