Rather, He commanded them: "Be,'' and they were, without any refusal or delay. They obeyed and responded to Him with submission and fear. Is He not then able to revive the dead This is similar to what Allah said elsewhere,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÎóáúŞõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÃóßúÜÈóÑõ ãöäú ÎóáúŞö ÇáäøóÇÓö æóáóÜßöäøó ÃóßúÜËóÑó ÇáäøóÇÓö áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, the creation of the heavens and earth is greater than the creation of the people.

(40:57) Allah responds to the above question by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáóì Åöäøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ</div><br>  (Yes, He surely is Able to do all things.)

"Those of determination'' among the Messengers are Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, `Isa and the last of all of the Prophets, Muhammad . Allah has specifically mentioned their names in two Ayat: Surat Al-Ahzab (33:7) and Surat Ash-Shura (42:13).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÓúÊóÚúÌöá áøóåõãú</div><br>  (and be in no hurry for them.) which means, `do not rush the punishment for them.' This is similar to Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóĞóÑúäöì æóÇáúãõßóĞøöÈöíäó Ãõæúáöì ÇáäøóÚúãóÉö æóãóåøöáúåõãú ŞóáöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And leave Me alone to deal with the rejectors, those who are in possession of good things of life.

(86:17) Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÃóäøóåõãú íóæúãó íóÑóæúäó ãóÇ íõæÚóÏõæäó áóãú íóáúÈóËõæÇú ÅöáÇøó ÓóÇÚóÉğ ãøöä äøóåóÇÑò</div><br>  (On the Day when they will see that which they are promised, it will be as though they had not remained (in the world) except an hour in a day.)

(79:46) and as He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóæúãó íóÍúÔõÑõåõãú ßóÃóä áøóãú íóáúÈóËõæÇú ÅöáÇøó ÓóÇÚóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáäøóåóÇÑö íóÊóÚóÇÑóİõæäó Èóíúäóåõãú</div><br>  (And on the Day when He shall gather them together, (it will be) as if they had not stayed but an hour of a day. They will recognize each other.)(10:45) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóáÇóÛñ</div><br>  (A clear message.) meaning, this Qur'an provides a clear concept.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóáú íõåúáóßõ ÅöáÇøó ÇáúŞóæúãõ ÇáúİóÜÓöŞõæäó</div><br>  (But will any be destroyed except the defiantly rebellious people) Which means that Allah does not destroy anyone except those who choose the way of destruction. It is part of Allah's justice that He does not punish anyone except those who deserve the punishment -- and Allah knows best. This concludes the explanation of Surat Al-Ahqaf. And all praise and blessings are due to Allah. Both success and protection from faults are by His help.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
