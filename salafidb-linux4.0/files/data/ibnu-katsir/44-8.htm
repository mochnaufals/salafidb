This was in the month of Ramadan, as Allah tells us:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÔóåúÑõ ÑóãóÖóÇäó ÇáøóĞöì ÃõäÒöáó İöíåö ÇáúŞõÑúÂäõ</div><br>  (The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an) (2:185). We have already quoted the relevant Hadiths in (the Tafsir of) Surat Al-Baqarah, and there is no need to repeat them here.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ ãõäĞöÑöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, We are ever warning.) means, telling them what is good for them and what is harmful for them, according to Shari`ah, so that the proof of Allah may be established against His servants.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåóÇ íõİúÑóŞõ ßõáøõ ÃóãúÑò Íóßöíãò </div><br>  (Therein (that night) is decreed every matter, Hakim.) means, on Laylatul-Qadr, the decrees are transferred from Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz to the (angelic) scribes who write down the decrees of the (coming) year including life span, provision, and what will happen until the end of the year. This was narrated from Ibn `Umar, Mujahid, Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak and others among the Salaf.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (Hakim) means decided or confirmed, which cannot be changed or altered. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóãúÑÇğ ãøöäú ÚöäúÏöäóÂ</div><br>  (As a command from Us.) meaning, everything that happens and is decreed by Allah and the revelation that He sends down -- it all happens by His command, by His leave and with His knowledge.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ ãõÑúÓöáöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, We are ever sending,) means, to mankind, sending Messenger who will recite to them the clear signs of Allah. The need for this was urgent.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÍúãóÉğ ãøöä ÑøóÈøößó Åöäøóåõ åõæó ÇáÓøóãöíÚõ ÇáúÚóáöíãõ ÑøóÈøõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóãóÇ ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ</div><br>  ((As) a mercy from your Lord.
