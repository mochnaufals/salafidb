Say: "Each one does according to Shakilatihi, and your Lord knows best of him whose path is right.'')</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Turning away from Allah at Times of Ease and despairing at Times of Calamity</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah tells us about the weakness that is inherent in man, except for those whom He protects at both times of ease and calamity. If Allah blesses a man with wealth, good health, ease, provision and help, and he gets what he wants, he turns away from the obedience and worship of Allah, and becomes arrogant. Mujahid said, "(It means) he goes away from Us.'' I say, this is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ßóÔóİúäóÇ Úóäúåõ ÖõÑøóåõ ãóÑøó ßóÃóä áøóãú íóÏúÚõäóÂ Åöáóì ÖõÑøò ãøóÓøóåõ</div><br>  (But when We have removed his harm from him, he passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!) 10:12 and;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ äóÌøóÜßõãú Åöáóì ÇáúÈóÑøö ÃóÚúÑóÖúÊõãú</div><br>  (But when He brings you safe to land, you turn away.) When man is stricken with evil, which means disasters, accidents and calamities,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇäó íóÆõæÓÇğ</div><br>  (he is in great despair.), meaning that he thinks he will never have anything good again. As Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöäú ÃóĞóŞúäóÇ ÇáÅöäúÓóÜäó ãöäøóÇ ÑóÍúãóÉğ Ëõãøó äóÒóÚúäóÇåóÇ ãöäúåõ Åöäøóåõ áóíóÆõæÓñ ßóİõæÑñ - æóáóÆöäú ÃóĞóŞúäóÇåõ äóÚúãóÂÁó ÈóÚúÏó ÖóÑøóÂÁó ãóÓøóÊúåõ áóíóŞõæáóäøó ĞóåóÈó ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÇÊõ Úóäøöí Åöäøóåõ áóİóÑöÍñ İóÎõæÑñ - ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÕóÈóÑõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÇÊö ÃõæúáóÜÆößó áóåõãú ãøóÛúİöÑóÉñ æóÃóÌúÑñ ßóÈöíÑñ </div><br>  (And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us, and remove it from him, verily, He is despairing, ungrateful. But if We let him taste good after evil has touched him, he is sure to say: "Ills have departed from me.'' Surely, he is exultant, and boastful. Except those who show patience and do righteous good deeds: those, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.) (11:9-11)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ßõáøñ íóÚúãóáõ Úóáóì ÔóÇßöáóÊöåö</div><br>  (Say: "Each one does according to Shakilatihi...'') Ibn `Abbas said, "According to his inclinations.'' Mujahid said, "According to his inclinations and his nature.'' Qatadah said, "According to his intentions.'' Ibn Zayd said, "According to his religion.'' All these suggestions are close in meaning. This Ayah - and Allah knows best - is a threat and a warning to the idolators, like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõá áøöáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÇÚúãóáõæÇú Úóáóì ãóßóÇäóÊößõãú</div><br>  (And say to those who do not believe: "Act according to your ability and way'') (11:121) So Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ßõáøñ íóÚúãóáõ Úóáóì ÔóÇßöáóÊöåö İóÑóÈøõßõãú ÃóÚúáóãõ Èöãóäú åõæó ÃóåúÏóì ÓóÈöíáÇğ </div><br>  (Say: "Each one does according to Shakilatihi, and your Lord knows best of him whose path is right.'') meaning either us or you. Everyone will be rewarded in accordance with his deeds, for nothing whatsoever is hidden from Allah.  </div></body></html>
