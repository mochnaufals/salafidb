Allah made the clouds work for them (bringing rain) so that they may produce their sustenance from them. He also created the ways and means of earnings, commercial activities and other professions. Yet, most of them give liltle thanks for this. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÊóÚõÏøõæÇú äöÚúãóÉó Çááøóåö áÇó ÊõÍúÕõæåóÇ Åöäøó ÇáÅäúÓóÇäó áóÙóáõæãñ ßóİøóÇÑñ</div><br>  (And if you count the blessings of Allah,never will you be able to count them.
