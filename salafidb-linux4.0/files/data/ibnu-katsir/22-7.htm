Then it changes and becomes a lump of flesh, like a piece of meat with no form or shape. Then it starts to take on a form and shape, developing a head, arms, chest, stomach, thighs, legs, feet and all its members.

He then writes its provision, its allotted length of life and whether it is to be one of the blessed or the wretched.''
