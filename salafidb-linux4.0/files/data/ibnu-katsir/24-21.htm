He accepts the repentance of those who repent to Him from this sin, and purifies those among them who are purified by the prescribed punishment carried out on them. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóÊøóÈöÚõæÇú ÎõØõæóÊö ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö</div><br>  (O you who believe!

This is a warning given in the most concise and eloquent manner. `Ali bin Abi Talhah recorded from Ibn `Abbas that   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎõØõæóÊö ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö</div><br>  (the Khutuwat of Shaytan) means his deeds. `Ikrimah said that it means his evil whispers. Qatadah said: "Every sin is one of the footsteps of Shaytan.'' Abu Mijlaz said: "Vowing to commit sin is one of the footsteps of Shaytan.'' Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæúáÇó İóÖúáõ Çááøóåö Úóáóíúßõãú æóÑóÍúãóÊõåõ ãóÇ Òóßóì ãöäßõã ãøöäú ÃóÍóÏò ÃóÈóÏÇğ</div><br>  (And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins.) meaning, if He did not help whomever He wills to repent and come back to Him and be purified from Shirk, evil and sin, and whatever bad characteristics each person has according to his nature, no one would ever attain purity and goodness.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöäøó Çááøóåó íõÒóßøöì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (But Allah purifies whom He wills) means, among His creation, and He sends astray whomever He wills, leaving him to be doomed in his misguidance and sin.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÓóãöíÚñ</div><br>  (and Allah is All-Hearer,) means, He hears what His servants say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáöíãñ</div><br>  (All-Knower.) of who deserves to be guided and who deserves to be misguided.  </div></body></html>
