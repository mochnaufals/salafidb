Then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, miserly towards good. Such have not believed. Therefore, Allah makes their deeds fruitless and that is ever easy for Allah.)  Allah tells us that His knowledge encompasses those who sought to tell others not to go out and who said to their brethren, meaning their companions, friend and acquaintances,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáõãøó ÅöáóíúäóÇ</div><br>  (Come here towards us,) meaning, come to where we are in the shade and enjoying fruits.

Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóáóŞõæßõã</div><br>  (they will smite you) means, "they will start to talk about you.'' Qatadah said: "But when it comes to the booty, the most miserly of people and the worst to have to share the booty with are those who say, `Give us, give us, we were there with you,' but during battle they were the most cowardly and the most likely to fail to support the truth.'' They are miserly towards good, meaning that there is no goodness in them, for they have combined cowardice with lies and little good.
