Similar was said by Muqatil bin Hayyan, who added, "The Prophet had a peace treaty with the Jews. When one of the Prophet's Companions would pass by a gathering of Jews, they would speak among themselves in secret, prompting the believer to think that they were plotting to kill or harm him. When the believer saw this, he feared for his safety and changed the route he was taking. The Prophet advised them to abandon their evil secret talks, but they did not listen and kept on holding the Najwa. Allah the Exalted sent down this Ayah in their case,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑó Åöáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó äõåõæÇú Úóäö ÇáäøóÌúæóì Ëõãøó íóÚõæÏõæäó áöãóÇ äõåõæÇú Úóäúåõ</div><br>  (Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden).''

So I said to them, `wa `Alaykum As-Sam (the same death be upon you).'

Ibn Jarir recorded that Anas bin Malik said, "A Jew passed by Allah's Messenger , who was sitting with his Companions, he greeted them and they greeted him back. Allah's Messenger then said to his Companions,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóáú ÊóÏúÑõæäó ãóÇ ŞóÇáó¿»</div><br>  (Do you know what he just said) They said, `He said: As-Salam, O Allah's Messenger.'

Allah's Messenger then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑõÏøõæå»</div><br>  (Bring him back,) and when he was brought back, the Prophet asked him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóŞõáúÊó: ÓóÇãñ Úóáóíúßõãú¿»</div><br>  (Did you say: Sam `Alaykum) He said, `Yes.'

The basis for the Hadith of Anas is in the Sahih and similar to this Hadith of `A'ishah is in the Sahih. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæäó İöì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú áóæúáÇó íõÚóĞøöÈõäóÇ Çááøóåõ ÈöãóÇ äóŞõæáõ</div><br>  (and say within themselves:"Why should Allah punish us not for what we say'') means, the Jews say these words, changing the meaning of the Islamic greeting, into an abusive statement, and then say, `Had he been a Prophet, Allah would have punished us for what we said. Allah knows what we conceal. Therefore, if Muhammad were a Prophet, Allah would have sent His punishment on us sooner, in this life.' Allah the Exalted replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÓúÈõåõãú Ìóåóäøóãõ</div><br>  (Hell will be sufficient for them;) ell should be sufficient for them in the Hereafter,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÕúáóæúäóåóÇ İóÈöÆúÓó ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ</div><br>  (they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Jews used to say, "Sam `Alayka,'' to Allah's Messenger . They would say then within themselves, "Why does Allah not punish us for what we say'' This Ayah was later revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁõæßó Íóíøóæúßó ÈöãóÇ áóãú íõÍóíøößó Èöåö Çááøóåõ æóíóŞõæáõæäó İöì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú áóæúáÇó íõÚóĞøöÈõäóÇ Çááøóåõ ÈöãóÇ äóŞõæáõ ÍóÓúÈõåõãú Ìóåóäøóãõ íóÕúáóæúäóåóÇ İóÈöÆúÓó ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ</div><br>  (And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and say within themselves: "Why should Allah punish us not for what we say'' Hell will be sufficient for them; they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Its chain of narration is Hasan, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not collect it. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Manners of the Najwa, (Secret Counsel)</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted teaches His believing servants to avoid the ways of the disbelievers and hypocrites,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÅöĞóÇ ÊóäóÇÌóíúÊõãú İóáÇó ÊóÊóäóÜÌóæúÇú ÈöÇáÅöËúãö æóÇáúÚõÏúæóÇäö æóãóÚúÕöíóÉö ÇáÑøóÓõæáö</div><br>  (O you who believe! When you hold secret counsel, do it not for sin and wrongdoing, and disobedience to the Messenger,) meaning, do not hold evil secret counsels like the ignorant disbelieving People of the Scriptures and their allies among the hypocrites, who imitate their ways,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóäóÜÌóæúÇú ÈöÇáúÈöÑøö æóÇáÊøóŞúæóì æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó ÇáøóĞöì Åöáóíúåö ÊõÍúÔóÑõæäó</div><br>  (but do it for Al-Birr and Taqwa; and have Taqwa of Allah unto Whom you shall be gathered.) and He will then inform you of all your deeds and statements; He has counted and recorded them and will justly hold you accountable for them. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáäøóÌúæóì ãöäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö áöíóÍúÒõäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóáóíúÓó ÈöÖóÂÑøöåöãú ÔóíúÆÇğ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÅöĞúäö Çááøóåö æóÚóáóì Çááøóåö İóáúíóÊóæóßøóáö ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó </div><br>  (An-Najwa are only from the Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.) Allah states that secret talks, where the believers feel anxious, are   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö áöíóÍúÒõäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú</div><br>  (only from Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) meaning, that those who hold such counsels do so because of the lures of the devil,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíóÍúÒõäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú</div><br>  (in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) The devil seeks to bother the believers, even though his plots will not harm the believers, except if Allah wills it. Those who are the subject of evil Najwa, should seek refuge in Allah and put his trust in Him, for none of it will harm them, Allah willing. The Sunnah also forbids the Najwa so that no Muslim is bothered by it. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ßõäúÊõãú ËóáóÇËóÉğ İóáóÇ íóÊóäóÇÌóì ÇËúäóÇäö Ïõæäó ÕóÇÍöÈöåöãóÇ¡ İóÅöäøó Ğáößó íõÍúÒöäõå»</div><br>  (If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, because that would cause him to be worried.) This Hadith is collected in the Two Sahihs using a chain of narration that contained Al-A`mash. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ßõäúÊõãú ËóáóÇËóÉğ İóáóÇ íóÊóäóÇÌóì ÇËúäóÇäö Ïõæäó ÇáËøóÇáöËö ÅöáøóÇ ÈöÅöĞúäöåö¡ İóÅöäøó Ğáößó íõÍúÒöäõå»</div><br>  (If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, except with his permission, because that would cause him to be worried.) Muslim collected this Hadith.  </div></body></html>
