Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä ÊóãöíÏó Èößõãú</div><br>  (lest it should shake with you.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóËøó İöíåóÇ ãöä ßõáøö ÏóÂÈøóÉò</div><br>  (And He has scattered therein moving creatures of all kinds) means, He has placed throughout it all kinds of animals, the total number of whose kinds and colors is known to no one except the One Who created them. When Allah tells us that He is the Creator, He also reminds us that He is the Provider, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÒóáúäóÇ ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ãóÂÁğ İóÃóäúÈóÊúäóÇ İöíåóÇ ãöä ßõáøö ÒóæúÌò ßóÑöíãò</div><br>  (And We send down water from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein in pairs,) meaning, every kind of good produce in pairs, i.e., they are beautiful to look at.
