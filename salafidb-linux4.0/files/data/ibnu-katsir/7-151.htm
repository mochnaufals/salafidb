And when Musa returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said: "What an evil thing is that which you have done during my absence. Did you hasten in matter of your Lord'' And he threw down the Tablets and seized his brother by (the hair of) his head and dragged him towards him. He (Harun) said: "O son of my mother! Indeed the people judged me weak and were about to kill me, so make not the enemies rejoice over me, nor put me among the people who are wrongdoers.'') (151. He (Musa) said: "O my Lord! Forgive me and my brother, and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.'')  Allah states that when Musa returned to his people after conversation with his Lord, he became angry and full of regret. Abu Ad-Darda' said that Asif, or regret, is the severest type of anger.</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÈöÆúÓóãóÇ ÎóáóİúÊõãõæäöì ãöä ÈóÚúÏöì</div><br>  (He (Musa) said: "What an evil thing is that which you have done during my absence.'') evil it is that which you committed after I departed and left you, by worshiping the calf,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÚóÌöáúÊõãú ÃóãúÑó ÑóÈøößõãú</div><br>  (Did you hasten in the matter of your Lord) Musa said, `You wanted me to rush back to you, even though being there this was Allah's decision' Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóáúŞóì ÇáÃóáúæóÇÍó æóÃóÎóĞó ÈöÑóÃúÓö ÃóÎöíåö íóÌõÑøõåõ Åöáóíúåö</div><br>  (And he threw down the Tablets and seized his brother by his head and dragged him towards him.)

It indicates that Musa threw down the Tablets because he was angry at his people, according to the majority of scholars of early and latter times. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÎóĞó ÈöÑóÃúÓö ÃóÎöíåö íóÌõÑøõåõ Åöáóíúåö</div><br>  (and seized his brother by (the hair of) his head and dragged him towards him.) for Musa feared that Harun might have not tried hard enough to forbid them from their evil action. In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó íåóÜÑõæäõ ãóÇ ãóäóÚóßó ÅöĞú ÑóÃóíúÊóåõãú ÖóáøõæÇú - ÃóáÇøó ÊóÊøóÈöÚóäö ÃóİóÚóÕóíúÊó ÃóãúÑöì - ŞóÇáó íóÈúäóÄõãøó áÇó ÊóÃúÎõĞú ÈöáöÍúíóÊöì æóáÇó ÈöÑóÃúÓöì Åöäøöì ÎóÔöíÊõ Ãóä ÊóŞõæáó İóÑøóŞúÊó Èóíúäó Èóäöì ÅöÓúÑÁöíáó æóáóãú ÊóÑúŞõÈú Şóæúáöì </div><br>  .(He Musa said: "O Harun ! What prevented you when you saw them going astray. That you followed me not (according to my advice to you) Have you then disobeyed my order'' He Harun said: "O son of my mother! Seize (me) not by my beard, nor by my head! Verily, I feared lest you should say: `You have caused a division among the Children of Israel, and you have not respected (waited or observed) my word!''') 20:92-94. Here, Allah said that Harun said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÈúäó Ãõãøó Åöäøó ÇáúŞóæúãó ÇÓúÊóÖúÚóİõæäöì æóßóÇÏõæÇú íóŞúÊõáõæäóäöì İóáÇó ÊõÔúãöÊú Èöìó ÇáÃóÚúÏóÂÁó æóáÇó ÊóÌúÚóáúäöì ãóÚó ÇáúŞóæúãö ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  ("O son of my mother! Indeed the people judged me weak and were about to kill me, so make not the enemies rejoice over me, nor put me among the people who are wrongdoers.'') Harun said, `Do not place me on the same level as they are, as if I was one of them.' Further, Harun said, `O son of my mother', so that Musa would feel more mercy and leniency towards him, even though Harun was also the son of Musa's father. When Musa was satisfied that his brother was innocent,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ŞóÇáó áóåõãú åóÜÑõæäõ ãöä ŞóÈúáõ íŞóæúãö ÅöäøóãóÇ İõÊöäÊõãú Èöåö æóÅöäøó ÑóÈøóßõãõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ İóÇÊøóÈöÚõæäöì æóÃóØöíÚõæÇú ÃóãúÑöì </div><br>  (And Harun indeed had said to them beforehand: "O my people!

Surely, he who observes something is nothing like he who is informed about it. His Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored, told him that his people were tested after him, but he did not throw the Tablets. When he saw them with his eyes, then he threw the Tablets.)  </div></body></html>
