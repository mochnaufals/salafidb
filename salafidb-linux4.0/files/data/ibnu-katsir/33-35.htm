Verily Allah says: (Verily, the Muslims: men and women, the believers: men and women...)) to the end of the Ayah.'' This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i and Ibn Jarir.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõÓúáöãöíäó æóÇáúãõÓúáöãóÜÊö æóÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó æóÇáúãõÄúãöäóÜÊö</div><br>  (Verily, the Muslims: men and women, the believers: men and women...) indicates that Iman is something other than Islam, and that it is more specific, because Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáóÊö ÇáÇøñÚúÑóÇÈõ ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Şõá áøóãú ÊõÄúãöäõæÇú æóáóÜßöä ŞõæáõæÇú ÃóÓúáóãúäóÇ æóáóãøóÇ íóÏúÎõáö ÇáÇíãóÜäõ İöì ŞõáõæÈößõãú</div><br>  (The bedouins say: "We believe.'' Say: "You believe not but you only say, `We have surrendered (in Islam),' for faith has not yet entered your hearts.'') (49:14). In the Two Sahihs, it says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóÒúäöí ÇáÒøóÇäöí Íöíäó íóÒúäöí æóåõæó ãõÄúãöä»</div><br>  (The adulterer does not commit adultery at the time when he is a believer.) For it snatches away his Iman, although that does not mean he is a disbeliever, according to the consensus of the Muslims. This indicates that Iman is more specific than Islam, as we have stated at the beginning of our commentary on Al-Bukhari.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúŞóÜäöÊöíäó æóÇáúŞóÜäöÊóÜÊö</div><br>  (the Qanit: men and the women,) Al-Qunut means obedience during quite time.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãøóäú åõæó ŞóÇäöÊñ ÁóÇäóÂÁó Çáøóíúáö ÓóÜÌöÏÇğ æóŞóÂÆöãÇğ íóÍúĞóÑõ ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉó æóíóÑúÌõæÇú ÑóÍúãóÉó ÑóÈøöåö</div><br>  (Is one who is (Qanit,) prostrating himself or standing in the middle of the night, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord...)

So, beyond Islam there is a higher level to be reached, which is Iman, and Qunut stems from them both.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÕøóÜÏöŞöíäó æóÇáÕøóÜÏöŞóÜÊö</div><br>  (the men and women who are truthful,) This refers to their speech, for truthfulness is a praiseworthy attribute. Some of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, were never known to have lied even once, neither during Jahiliyyah nor in Islam. Truthfulness is a sign of faith, just as lying is a sign of hypocrisy. Whoever is truthful will be saved:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Úóáóíúßõãú ÈöÇáÕøöÏúŞö İóÅöäøó ÇáÕøöÏúŞó íóåúÏöí Åöáóì ÇáúÈöÑøö¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáúÈöÑøó íóåúÏöí Åöáóì ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóÅöíøóÇßõãú æóÇáúßóĞöÈó¡ İóÅöäøó ÇáúßóĞöÈó íóåúÏöí Åöáóì ÇáúİõÌõæÑö¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáúİõÌõæÑó íóåúÏöí Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ æóáóÇ íóÒóÇáõ ÇáÑøóÌõáõ íóÕúÏõŞõ æóíóÊóÍóÑøóì ÇáÕøöÏúŞó ÍóÊøóì íõßúÊóÈó ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ÕöÏøöíŞğÇ¡ æóáóÇ íóÒóÇáõ ÇáÑøóÌõáõ íóßúĞöÈõ æóíóÊóÍóÑøóì ÇáúßóĞöÈó ÍóÊøóì íõßúÊóÈó ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ßóĞøóÇÈğÇ»</div><br>  (You have to be truthful, for truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise. And beware of lying, for lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hell. A man will keep telling the truth and striving to do so until he will be recorded with Allah as a truthful. And a man will keep telling lies and will persist in doing so until he will be recorded with Allah as a liar.) And there are many Hadiths on this topic.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÕøóÜÈöÑöíäó æóÇáÕøóÜÈöÑóÊö</div><br>  (the men and the women who are patient,) This is the attribute of those who are steadfast, which is patience in the face of adversity and knowing that what is decreed will inevitably come to pass. So, they face it with patience and steadfastness. Patience is the most difficult when disaster first strikes, then after that it becomes easier, and this is true steadfastness.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÎóÜÔöÚöíäó æóÇáúÎóÜÔöÚóÜÊö</div><br>  (the Khashi`: men and the women,) Khushu` means serenity and tranquillity, deliberation and dignity and humility. What motivates a person to be like this is the fear of Allah and the awareness that He is constantly watching, as mentioned in the Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÚúÈõÏõ Çááåó ßóÃóäøóßó ÊóÑóÇåõ İóÅöäú áóãú Êóßõäú ÊóÑóÇåõ İóÅöäøóåõ íóÑóÇß»</div><br>  (Worship Allah as if you can see Him, for if you cannot see Him, He can see you.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõÊóÕóÏøöŞöíäó æóÇáúãõÊóÕóÏøöŞóÜÊö</div><br>  (the men and the women who give Sadaqat,) As-Sadaqah (charity) means doing good to people who are in need or who are weak and have no means of earning a living and none to financially support them. They give them from the excess of their wealth in obedience to Allah and as a good deed to His creation. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóÈúÚóÉñ íõÙöáøõåõãõ Çááåõ İöí Ùöáøöåö íóæúãó áóÇ Ùöáøó ÅöáøóÇ Ùöáøõåõ İóĞóßóÑó ãöäúåõãú æóÑóÌõáñ ÊóÕóÏøóŞó ÈöÕóÏóŞóÉò İóÃóÎúİóÇåóÇ ÍóÊøóì áóÇÊóÚúáóãó ÔöãóÇáõåõ ãóÇ ÊõäúİöŞõ íóãöíäõå»</div><br>  (There are seven whom Allah will shade with His Shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His Shade -- and among them he mentioned -- . ..a man who gave in charity and concealed it to the extent that his left hand did not know what his right hand was giving.) According to another Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉõ ÊõØúİöìÁõ ÇáúÎóØöíÆóÉó ßóãóÇ íõØúİöìÁõ ÇáúãóÇÁõ ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (Sadaqah extinguishes bad deeds just as water extinguishes fire.) There are many Hadiths which encourage charitable giving; this topic is discussed in detail elsewhere.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æÇáÕøóÜÆöãöíäó æÇáÕøóÜÆöãóÜÊö</div><br>  (the men and the women who fast,) According to a Hadith narrated by Ibn Majah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáÕøóæúãõ ÒóßóÇÉõ ÇáúÈóÏóä»</div><br>  (Fasting is the Zakah of the body.) In other words, it purifies it and cleanses it of things that are bad in both physical and Shar`i terms. Sa`id bin Jubayr said: "Whoever fasts Ramadan and three days of each month, is included in the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æÇáÕøóÜÆöãöíäó æÇáÕøóÜÆöãóÜÊö</div><br>  (the men and the women who fast,)'' Fasting is also one of the greatest means of overcoming one's desires, as the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇãóÚúÔóÑó ÇáÔøóÈóÇÈö ãóäö ÇÓúÊóØóÇÚó ãöäúßõãõ ÇáúÈóÇÁóÉó İóáúíóÊóÒóæøóÌú¡ İóÅöäøóåõ ÃóÛóÖøõ áöáúÈóÕóÑö æóÃóÍúÕóäõ áöáúİóÑúÌö¡ æóãóäú áóãú íóÓúÊóØöÚú İóÚóáóíúåö ÈöÇáÕøóæúãö İóÅöäøóåõ áóåõ æöÌóÇÁ»</div><br>  (O young men! Whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, for it is most effective in lowering the gaze and protecting the chastity. And whoever cannot get married, then let him fast, for it will be a protection for him.) It is quite apt that next should be mentioned:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÍóÜİöÙöíäó İõÑõæÌóåõãú æóÇáúÍóÜİöÜÙóÜÊö</div><br>  (the men and the women who guard their chastity) i.e., they protect their private parts from forbidden and sinful things, except for that which is permitted. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú áöİõÑõæÌöåöãú ÍóÜİöÙõæäó - ÅöáÇøó Úóáóì ÃóÒúæóÌöåöãú Ãóæú ãóÇ ãóáóßóÊú ÃóíúãóÜäõåõãú İóÅöäøóåõãú ÛóíúÑõ ãóáõæãöíäó - İóãóäö ÇÈúÊóÛóì æóÑóÂÁó Ğáößó İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÚóÇÏõæäó </div><br>  (And those who guard their chastity. Except from their wives or the whom their right hands possess -- for they are not blameworthy. But whosoever seeks beyond that, then it is those who are trespassers.) (70:29-31)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáĞóßöÜÑöíäó Çááøóåó ßóËöíÑÇğ æóÇáĞóßöÑóÊö</div><br>  (and the men and the women who remember Allah much) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÃóíúŞóÙó ÇáÑøóÌõáõ ÇãúÑóÃóÊóåõ ãöäó Çááøóíúáö İóÕóáøóíóÇ ÑóßúÚóÊóíúäö ßõÊöÈóÇ Êöáúßó ÇááøóíúáóÉó ãöäó ÇáĞøóÇßöÑöíäó Çááåó ßóËöíÑğÇ æóÇáĞøóÇßöÑóÇÊ»</div><br>  (If a man wakes his wife at night and they pray two Rak`ahs, they will recorded that night as being among the men and the women who remember Allah much.) This was recorded by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah from the Hadith of Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with them both, from the Prophet . Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "The Messenger of Allah was walking along a road in Makkah, and he came to (the mountain of) Jumdan, and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóĞóÇ ÌõãúÏóÇäõ¡ ÓöíÑõæÇ¡ İóŞóÏú ÓóÈóŞó ÇáúãõİóÑøöÏõæä»</div><br>  (This is Jumdan, go ahead, for the Mufarridun have gone ahead.(The men and the women who remember Allah much) Then he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó ÇÛúİöÑú áöáúãõÍóáøöŞöíä»</div><br>  (O Allah, forgive those who shaved their hair.)

They said, `And those who shortened.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáúãõŞóÕøöÑöíä»</div><br>  (And those who shortened.) This was recorded by Imam Ahmad with this chain of narration. It was also recorded by Muslim, except for the last part of it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÚóÏøó Çááøóåõ áóåõã ãøóÛúİöÑóÉğ æóÃóÌúÑÇğ ÚóÙöíãÇğ</div><br>  (Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward.) Here Allah tells us that for all of those mentioned in this Ayah, He has prepared for them forgiveness of their sins and a great reward, meaning, Paradise.  </div></body></html>
