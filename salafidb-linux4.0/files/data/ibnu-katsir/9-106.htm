Some Companions stayed behind from the battle of Tabuk due to laziness, preferring comfort, ease, ripe fruits and shade. They did not lag behind because of hypocrisy or doubts. Some of them tied themselves to the pillars (of the Masjid) like Abu Lubabah and several of his friends did. Some of them did not do that, and they are the three mentioned here. Those who tied themselves received their pardon before these three men whose pardon was delayed, until this Ayah was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÊóÇÈó Çááå Úóáóì ÇáäøóÈöìøö æóÇáúãõåóÜÌöÑöíäó æóÇáÇøñäÕóÜÑö</div><br>  (Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin and the Ansar...)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóáóì ÇáËøóáóÜËóÉö ÇáøóĞöíäó ÎõáøöİõæÇú ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ÖóÇŞóÊú Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáÃóÑúÖõ ÈöãóÇ ÑóÍõÈóÊú</div><br>  (And the three who stayed behind, until for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened...)
