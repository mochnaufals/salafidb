As Qatadah said concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó ÇáúãóÓóÜÌöÏó áöáøóåö İóáÇó ÊóÏúÚõæÇú ãóÚó Çááøóåö ÃóÍóÏÇğ </div><br>  (And the Masjids are for Allah, so invoke not anyone along with Allah.) "Whenever the Jews and Christians used to enter their churches and synagogues, they would associate partners with Allah. Thus, Allah commanded His Prophet to tell them that they should single Him out alone for worship.'' Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning this verse,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó ÇáúãóÓóÜÌöÏó áöáøóåö İóáÇó ÊóÏúÚõæÇú ãóÚó Çááøóåö ÃóÍóÏÇğ </div><br>  (And the Masjids are for Allah, so invoke not anyone along with Allah.) "The Jinns said to the Prophet of Allah , `How can we come to the Masjid while we are distant - meaning very far away - from you And how can we be present for the prayer while we are far away from you' So Allah revealed this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó ÇáúãóÓóÜÌöÏó áöáøóåö İóáÇó ÊóÏúÚõæÇú ãóÚó Çááøóåö ÃóÍóÏÇğ </div><br>  (And the Masjids are for Allah, so invoke not anyone along with Allah.)'' The Jinns crowding together to hear the Qur'an Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõ áøóãóÇ ŞóÇãó ÚóÈúÏõ Çááøóåö íóÏúÚõæåõ ßóÇÏõæÇú íóßõæäõæäó Úóáóíúåö áöÈóÏÇğ </div><br>  (And when the servant of Allah stood up invoking Him in prayer they just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other.) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, "When they heard the Prophet reciting the Qur'an they almost mounted on top of him due to their zeal. When they heard him reciting the Qur'an they drew very near to him. He was unaware of them until the messenger (i.e., Jibril) came to him and made him recite,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃõæÍöìó Åöáóìøó Ãóäøóåõ ÇÓúÊóãóÚó äóİóÑñ ãøöäó ÇáúÌöäøö</div><br>  (Say: "It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinn listened.'') (72:1) They were listening to the Qur'an.'' This is one opinion and it has been reported from Az-Zubayr bin Al-`Awwam. Ibn Jarir recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "The Jinns said to their people,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóãóÇ ŞóÇãó ÚóÈúÏõ Çááøóåö íóÏúÚõæåõ ßóÇÏõæÇú íóßõæäõæäó Úóáóíúåö áöÈóÏÇğ</div><br>  (when the servant of Allah stood up invoking Him in prayer they just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other.) )'' This is the second view and it has also been reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr. Al-Hasan said, "When the Messenger of Allah stood up and said none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and he called the people to their Lord, the Arabs almost crowded over him together (against him).'' Qatadah said concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõ áøóãóÇ ŞóÇãó ÚóÈúÏõ Çááøóåö íóÏúÚõæåõ ßóÇÏõæÇú íóßõæäõæäó Úóáóíúåö áöÈóÏÇğ </div><br>  (when the servant of Allah stood up invoking Him in prayer they just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other.) "Humans and Jinns both crowded together over this matter in order to extinguish it. However, Allah insisted upon helping it, supporting it and making it victorious over those who opposed it.'' This is the third view and it has also been reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ibn Zayd. It was also the view preferred by Ibn Jarir. This view seems to be the most apparent meaning of the Ayah due to Allah's statement which follows it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóÏúÚõæ ÑóÈøöì æóáÇó ÃõÔúÑößõ Èöåö ÃóÍóÏÇğ </div><br>  (Say: "I invoke only my Lord, and I associate none as partners along with Him.'') meaning, when they harmed him, opposed him, denied him and stood against him in order to thwart the truth he came with, and to unite against him, the Messenger said to them   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóÏúÚõæ ÑóÈøöì</div><br>  (I invoke only my Lord,) meaning, `I only worship my Lord alone, and He has no partners. I seek His help and I put my trust in Him.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÃõÔúÑößõ Èöåö ÃóÍóÏÇğ</div><br>  (and I associate none as partners along with Him.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Messenger does not have Power to harm or give Guidance</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Åöäøöì áÇó Ãóãúáößõ áóßõãú ÖóÑøÇğ æóáÇó ÑóÔóÏÇğ </div><br>  (Say: "It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the right path.'') meaning, `say: I am only a man like you all and I have received revelation. I am only a servant among the servants of Allah. I have no control over the affairs of your guidance or your misguidance. Rather all of these things are referred to Allah.' Then he (the Prophet) says about himself that no one can save him from Allah either. This means, `if I disobey Allah, then no one would be able to rescue me from His punishment.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóäú ÃóÌöÏó ãöä Ïõæäöåö ãõáúÊóÍóÏÇğ</div><br>  (and nor can I find refuge except in Him.) Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi all said, "No place to escape to.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>It is only obligatory upon the Messenger to convey the Message</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÈóáÇóÛÇğ ãøöäó Çááøóåö æóÑöÓóÜáóÜÊöåö</div><br>  ((Mine is) but conveyance from Allah and His Messages,) This is an exception related to the previous statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä íõÌöíÑóäöì ãöäó Çááøóåö ÃóÍóÏñ</div><br>  (None can protect me from Allah's punishment,) meaning, `nothing can save me from Him and rescue me except my conveyance of the Message that He has obligated me to carry out.' This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáÑøóÓõæáõ ÈóáøöÛú ãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúßó ãöä ÑøóÈøößó æóÅöä áøóãú ÊóİúÚóáú İóãóÇ ÈóáøóÛúÊó ÑöÓóÇáóÊóåõ æóÇááøóåõ íóÚúÕöãõßó ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (O Messenger! Proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind.) (5:67) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÚúÕö Çááøóåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ İóÅöäøó áóåõ äóÇÑó Ìóåóäøóãó ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÂ ÃóÈóÏÇğ</div><br>  (and whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then verily, for him is the fire of Hell, he shall dwell therein forever.) meaning, `I will convey unto you all the Messages of Allah, so whoever disobeys after that, then his reward will be the fire of Hell wherein he will abide forever.' This means, they will not be able to avoid it nor escape from it. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóæúÇú ãóÇ íõæÚóÏõæäó İóÓóíóÚúáóãõæäó ãóäú ÃóÖúÚóİõ äóÇÕöÑÇğ æóÃóŞóáøõ ÚóÏóÏÇğ </div><br>  (Till, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who it is that is weaker concerning helpers and less important concerning numbers.) meaning, until these idolators from the Jinns and humans see what has been promised to them on the Day of Judgement. Then on that day, they will know who's helpers are weaker and fewer in number -- them or the believers who worship Allah alone. This means that the idolators have no helper at all and they are fewer in number than the soldiers of Allah.  </div></body></html>
