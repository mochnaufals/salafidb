It is recorded in the Two Sahihs, that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó áóãøóÇ ÎóáóŞó ÇáúÎóáúŞó¡ ßóÊóÈó ßöÊóÇÈğÇ ÚöäúÏóåõ İóæúŞó ÇáúÚóÑúÔö¡ Åöäøó ÑóÍúãóÊöí ÊóÛúáöÈõ ÛóÖóÈöí»</div><br>  (When Allah created the creation, He wrote in a Book that He has with Him above the Throne; `My mercy overcomes My anger.')

As for those who deny and refuse, they are in confusion and disarray. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÎóÓöÑõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóåõã</div><br>  (Those who destroy themselves) on the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåõãú áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (will not believe. ) in the Return and thus do not fear the repercussions of that Day.
