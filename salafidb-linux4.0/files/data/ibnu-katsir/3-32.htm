But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah's Love is Attained by Following the Messenger</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  This honorable Ayah judges against those who claim to love Allah, yet do not follow the way of Muhammad . Such people are not true in their claim until they follow the Shari`ah (Law) of Muhammad and his religion in all his statements, actions and conditions. It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Úóãöáó ÚóãóáğÇ áóíúÓó Úóáóíúåö ÃóãúÑõäóÇ İóåõæó ÑóÏ»</div><br>  (Whoever commits an act that does not conform with our matter (religion), then it will be rejected of him.)  This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÊõÍöÈøõæäó Çááøóåó İóÇÊøóÈöÚõæäöì íõÍúÈöÈúßõãõ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (Say (O Muhammad to mankind): "If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you...'') meaning, what you will earn is much more than what you sought in loving Him, for Allah will love you. Al-Hasan Al-Basri and several scholars among the Salaf commented, "Some people claimed that they love Allah. So Allah tested them with this Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÊõÍöÈøõæäó Çááøóåó İóÇÊøóÈöÚõæäöì íõÍúÈöÈúßõãõ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (Say (O Muhammad to mankind): "If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you...''). ''  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÛúİöÑú áóßõãú ĞõäõæÈóßõãú æóÇááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  ("And forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'') meaning, by your following the Messenger , you will earn all this with the blessing of his mission. Allah next commands everyone,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóØöíÚõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇáÑøóÓõæáó İÅöä ÊóæóáøóæúÇú</div><br>  (Say: "Obey Allah and the Messenger.'' But if they turn away) by defying the Prophet ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (then Allah does not like the disbelievers.) thus, testifying that defiance of the Messenger's way constitutes Kufr. Indeed, Allah does not like whoever does this, even if he claims that he loves Allah and seeks a means of approach to Him, unless, and until, he follows the unlettered Prophet, the Final Messenger from Allah to the two creations: mankind and the Jinn. This is the Prophet who, if the previous Prophets and mighty Messengers were to have been alive during his time, they would have no choice but to follow, obey him, and to abide by his Law. We will mention this fact when we explain the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ÃóÎóĞó Çááøóåõ ãöíËóÜŞó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíúäó</div><br>  (And (remember) when Allah took the Covenant of the Prophets) 3:81, Allah willing.  </div></body></html>
