Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who are, by Allah's leave, foremost in good deeds. That -- that is indeed a great grace.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Inheritance of the Qur'an is of three kinds</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says: `Then We made those who uphold the Book confirming what came before, the one whom We have chosen from among Our servants. They are this Ummah, who are divided into three types.' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãöäúåõãú ÙóÜáöãñ áøöäóİúÓöåö</div><br>  (Then of them are some who wrong themselves,) these are the ones who are careless about doing some obligatory actions, and who commit some forbidden actions.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäúåõãú ãøõŞúÊóÕöÏñ</div><br>  (and of them are some who follow a middle course,) these are the ones who fulfill their obligations and avoid things that are forbidden, but they may neglect some good deeds and do some things which are disliked.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäúåõãú ÓóÇÈöŞñ ÈöÇáúÎóíúÑóÊö ÈöÅöĞõäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (and of them are some who are, by Allah's leave, foremost in good deeds.) these are the ones who do obligatory actions and things which are encouraged, and who avoid doing unlawful and disliked actions, and avoid some actions which are permissible. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÃóæúÑóËúäóÇ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÕúØóİóíúäóÇ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöäóÇ</div><br>  (Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. ) "This refers to the Ummah of Muhammad . Allah caused it to inherit every Book that He had revealed; those who wrong themselves will be forgiven, those who follow a middle course will have an easy accounting, and those who are foremost in good deeds will enter Paradise without being brought to account.'' Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani reported from Ibn `Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said one day:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÔóİóÇÚóÊöí áöÃóåúáö ÇáúßóÈóÇÆöÑö ãöäú ÃõãøóÊöí»</div><br>  (My intercession will be for those among my Ummah who commit major sins.)'' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Those who are foremost in good deeds will enter Paradise without being brought to account; those who follow a middle course will enter Paradise by the mercy of Allah; and those who wrong themselves and Ashab Al-A`raf will enter Paradise by the intercession of Muhammad .'' It was also reported from a number of the Salaf that those among this Ummah who wrong themselves are still among those whom Allah has chosen, even though they are imperfect and fell short by not adhering to the straight path. Others said that those who wrong themselves are not part of this Ummah and are not among those whom Allah has chosen and who inherited the Book. The correct view is that they are also part of this Ummah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Virtues of the Scholars</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The scholars are the most fortunate of people with regard to this blessing, and the most entitled to this mercy. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Qays bin Kathir said, "One of the people of Al-Madinah came to Abu Ad-Darda', may Allah be pleased with him, when he was in Damascus. Abu Ad-Darda' said, `What brought you here, my brother' He said, `A Hadith which I heard that you narrate from the Messenger of Allah .' He said, `Have you come for trade' He said, `No.' He said, `Have you come for any other reason' He said, `No.' He said, `Have you come only to seek this Hadith' He said, `Yes.' He, may Allah be pleased with him said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Óóáóßó ØóÑöíŞğÇ íóØúáõÈõ İöíåóÇ ÚöáúãğÇ¡ Óóáóßó Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì Èöåö ØóÑöíŞğÇ Åöáóì ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉó áóÊóÖóÚõ ÃóÌúäöÍóÊóåóÇ ÑöÖğÇ áöØóÇáöÈö ÇáúÚöáúãö¡ æóÅöäøóåõ áóíóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõ áöáúÚóÇáöãö ãóäú İöí ÇáÓøóãóæóÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖö ÍóÊøóì ÇáúÍöíÊóÇäõ İöí ÇáúãóÇÁö¡ æóİóÖúáõ ÇáúÚóÇáöãö Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÇÈöÏö ßóİóÖúáö ÇáúŞóãóÑö Úóáóì ÓóÇÆöÑö ÇáúßóæóÇßöÈö¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáúÚõáóãóÇÁó åõãú æóÑóËóÉõ ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁö¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁó áóãú íõæóÑøöËõæÇ ÏöíäóÇÑğÇ æóáóÇ ÏöÑúåóãğÇ¡ æóÅöäøóãóÇ æóÑøóËõæÇ ÇáúÚöáúãó¡ İóãóäú ÃóÎóĞó Èöåö ÃóÎóĞó ÈöÍóÙó æóÇİöÑ»</div><br>  (Whoever follows a path to seek knowledge, Allah will show him the way to Paradise. The angels lower their wings being pleased with the one who seeks knowledge. Whoever is in the heavens and on earth, even the fish in the sea, ask for forgiveness for the scholar. The superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is like that of the moon over all other heavenly bodies. The scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, for the Prophets did not leave behind Dinars and Dirhams, but they left behind knowledge; and whoever receives it, receives an abundance of good fortune.)''' It was also reported by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah.  </div></body></html>
