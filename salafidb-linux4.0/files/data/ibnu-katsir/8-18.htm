Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãú ÊóŞúÊõáõæåõãú æóáóÜßöäøó Çááøóåó ŞóÊóáóåõãú</div><br>  (You killed them not, but Allah killed them.) meaning, it is not because of your power and strength that you killed the pagans, who were many while you were few. Rather, it is He Who gave you victory over them, just as He said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú äóÕóÑóßõãõ Çááøóåõ ÈöÈóÏúÑò æóÃóäÊõãú ÃóĞöáøóÉñ</div><br>  (And Allah has already made you victorious at Badr, when you were a weak little force.) 3:123, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú äóÕóÑóßõãõ Çááøóåõ İöì ãóæóÇØöäó ßóËöíÑóÉò æóíóæúãó Íõäóíúäò ÅöĞú ÃóÚúÌóÈóÊúßõãú ßóËúÑóÊõßõãú İóáóãú ÊõÛúäö Úóäßõãú ÔóíúÆÇğ æóÖóÇŞóÊú Úóáóíúßõãõ ÇáÃóÑúÖõ ÈöãóÇ ÑóÍõÈóÊú Ëõãøó æóáøóíúÊõã ãøõÏúÈöÑöíäó </div><br>  (Truly, Allah has given you victory on many battlefields, and on the day of Hunayn when you rejoiced at your great number, but it availed you naught and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you, then you turned back in flight.) 9:25  Allah, the Exalted and Ever High, states that victory does not depend on numbers or collecting weapons and shields. Rather, victory is from Him, Exalted He is.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóã ãøöä İöÆóÉò ŞóáöíáóÉò ÛóáóÈóÊú İöÆóÉò ßóËöíÑóÉğ ÈöÅöĞúäö Çááøóåö æóÇááøóåõ ãóÚó ÇáÕøóÜÈöÑöíäó</div><br>  (How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah's leave'' And Allah is with the patient.) 2:249  Allah then mentioned the handful of sand that His Prophet threw at the disbelievers during the day of Badr, when he went out of his bunker. While in the bunker, the Prophet invoked Allah humbly and expressing his neediness before Allah. He then threw a handful of sand at the disbelievers and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÔóÇåóÊö ÇáúæõÌõæå»</div><br>  (Humiliated be their faces.) He then commanded his Companions to start fighting with sincerity and they did. Allah made this handful of sand enter the eyes of the idolators, each one of them were struck by some of it and it distracted them making each of them busy. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÑóãóíúÊó ÅöĞú ÑóãóíúÊó æóáóÜßöäøó Çááøóåó Ñóãóì</div><br>  (And you threw not when you did throw, but Allah threw.)  Therefore, it is Allah Who made the sand reach their eyes and busied them with it, not you (O Muhammad) .  Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Muhammad bin Ja`far bin Az-Zubayr narrated to him that `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöíõÈúáöìó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ãöäúåõ ÈóáÇóÁğ ÍóÓóäğÇ</div><br>  (that He might test the believers by a fair trial from Him. ) "So that the believers know Allah's favor for them by giving them victory over their enemy, even though their enemy was numerous, while they were few. They should thus know His right and express gratitude for His favor on them.'' Similar was said by Ibn Jarir. It is stated in a Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóßõáøó ÈóáóÇÁò ÍóÓóäò ÃóÈúáóÇäóÇ»</div><br>  (Every trail (from Allah) is a favor for us.)  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÓóãöíÚñ Úóáöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.)  Allah hears the supplication and knows those who deserve help and triumph. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößõãú æóÃóäøó Çááøóåó ãõæåöäõ ßóíúÏö ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó </div><br>  (This (is the fact) and surely Allah weakens the deceitful plots of the disbelievers.) This is more good news, aside from the victory that the believers gained. Allah informed them that He will weaken the plots of the disbelievers in the future, degrade them and make everything they have perish and be destroyed, all praise and thanks are due to Allah.  </div></body></html>
