And it is they who are the successful.) (105. And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment.) (106. On the Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) when some faces will become white and some faces will become black; as for those whose faces will become black (to them will be said): "Did you reject faith after accepting it Then taste the torment (in Hell) for rejecting faith.'') (107. And for those whose faces will become white, they will be in Allah's mercy (Paradise), therein they shall dwell forever.) (108. These are the Ayat of Allah. We recite them to you in truth, and Allah wills no injustice to the `Alamin.) (109. And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And all matters go back (for decision) to Allah.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to Establish the Invitation to Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáúÊóßõä ãøöäúßõãú ÃõãøóÉñ</div><br>  (Let there arise out of you a group of people)  that calls to righteousness, enjoins all that is good and forbids evil in the manner Allah commanded,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúãõİúáöÍõæäó</div><br>  (And it is they who are the successful.)  Ad-Dahhak said, "They are a special group of the Companions and a special group of those after them, that is those who perform Jihad and the scholars.''  The objective of this Ayah is that there should be a segment of this Muslim Ummah fulfilling this task, even though it is also an obligation on every member of this Ummah, each according to his ability. Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÑóÃóì ãöäúßõãú ãõäúßóÑğÇ İóáúíõÛóíøöÑúåõ ÈöíóÏöåö¡ İóÅöäú áóãú íóÓúÊóØöÚú İóÈöáöÓóÇäöåö¡ İóÅöäú áóãú íóÓúÊóØöÚ İóÈöŞóáúÈöåö¡ æóĞáößó ÃóÖúÚóİõ ÇáúÅöíãóÇä»</div><br>  (Whoever among you witnesses an evil, let him change it with his hand. If he is unable, then let him change it with his tongue. If he is unable, then let him change it with his heart, and this is the weakest faith.) In another narration, The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóáóíúÓó æóÑóÇÁó Ğóáößó ãöäó ÇáúÅöíãóÇäö ÍóÈøóÉõ ÎóÑúÏóá»</div><br>  (There is no faith beyond that, not even the weight of a mustard seed.)  Imam Ahmad recorded that Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöå¡ áóÊóÃúãõÑõäøó ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö¡ æóáóÊóäúåóæõäøó Úóäö ÇáúãõäúßóÑö¡ Ãóæú áóíõæÔößóäøó Çááåõ Ãóäú íóÈúÚóËó Úóáóíúßõãú ÚöŞóÇÈğÇ ãöäú ÚöäúÏöåö¡ Ëõãøó áÊóÏúÚõäøóÜÜåõ İóáóÇ íóÓúÊóÌöíÈó áóßõã»</div><br>  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will enjoin righteousness and forbid evil, or Allah shall send down a punishment from Him to you. Then, you will supplicate to Him, but He will not accept your supplication.)  At-Tirmidhi also collected this Hadith and said, "Hasan''. There are many other Hadiths and Ayat on this subject, which will be explained later. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Prohibition of Division</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóßõæäõæÇú ßóÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóİóÑøóŞõæÇú æóÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇú ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõãõ ÇáúÈóíøöäóÜÊõ</div><br>  (And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them) 3:105.  In this Ayah, Allah forbids this Ummah from imitating the division and discord of the nations that came before them. These nations also abandoned enjoining righteousness and forbidding evil, although they had proof of its necessity.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu `Amir `Abdullah bin Luhay said, "We performed Hajj with Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan. When we arrived at Makkah, he stood up after praying Zuhr and said, `The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Ãóåúáó ÇáúßöÊóÇÈóíúäö ÇİúÊóÑóŞõæÇ İöí Ïöíäöåöãú Úóáì ËöäúÊóíúäö æóÓóÈúÚöíäó ãöáøóÉğ¡ æóÅöäøó åĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉó ÓóÊóİúÊóÑöŞõ Úóáì ËóáóÇËò æóÓóÈúÚöíäó ãöáøóÉğ íóÚúäöí ÇáúÃóåúæóÇÁó ßõáøõåóÇ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑö ÅöáøóÇ æóÇÍöÏóÉğ æóåöíó ÇáúÌóãóÇÚóÉõ æóÅöäøóåõ ÓóíóÎúÑõÌõ İöí ÃõãøóÊöí ÃóŞúæóÇãñ ÊóÌóÇÑóì Èöåöãú Êöáúßó ÇáúÃóåúæóÇÁõ ßóãóÇ íóÊóÌóÇÑóì ÇáúßóáóÈõ ÈöÕóÇÍöÈöå¡ áóÇ íóÈúŞóì ãöäúåõ ÚöÑúŞñ æóáóÇ ãóİúÕöáñ ÅöáøóÇ ÏóÎóáóå»</div><br>  (The People of the Two Scriptures divided into seventy-two sects. This Ummah will divide into seventy-three sects, all in the Fire except one, that is, the Jama`ah. Some of my Ummah will be guided by desire, like one who is infected by rabies; no vein or joint will be saved from these desires.)  Mu`awiyah said next: By Allah, O Arabs! If you do not adhere to what came to you from your Prophet then other people are even more prone not to adhere to it. '' Similar was recorded by Abu Dawud from Ahmad bin Hanbal and Muhammad bin Yahya. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Benefits of Brotherly Ties and Unity and the Consequence of Division on the Day of the Gathering</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊóÈúíóÖøõ æõÌõæåñ æóÊóÓúæóÏøõ æõÌõæåñ</div><br>  (On the Day when some faces will become white and some faces will become black;) 3:106 on the Day of Resurrection. This is when the faces of followers of the Sunnah and the Jama`ah will radiate with whiteness, and the faces of followers of Bid`ah (innovation) and division will be darkened, as has been reported from Ibn `Abbas. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóãøóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÓúæóÏøóÊú æõÌõæåõåõãú ÃóßúİóÑúÊõãú ÈóÚúÏó ÅöíãóÜäößõãú</div><br>  (As for those whose faces will become black (to them will be said): "Did you reject faith after accepting it")  Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "They are the hypocrites.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞõæŞõæÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó ÈöãóÇ ßõäúÊõãú ÊóßúİõÑõæäó</div><br>  (Then taste the torment (in Hell) for rejecting faith,) and this description befits every disbeliever.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÈúíóÖøóÊú æõÌõæåõåõãú İóİöì ÑóÍúãóÉö Çááøóåö åõãú İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó </div><br>  (And for those whose faces will become white, they will be in Allah's mercy (Paradise), therein they shall dwell forever.) in Paradise, where they will reside for eternity and shall never desire to be removed. Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Abu Ghalib said, "Abu Umamah saw heads (of the Khawarij sect) hanging on the streets of Damascus. He commented, `The Dogs of the Fire and the worst dead people under the cover of the sky. The best dead men are those whom these have killed.' He then recited,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊóÈúíóÖøõ æõÌõæåñ æóÊóÓúæóÏøõ æõÌõæåñ</div><br>  (On the Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) when some faces will become white and some faces will become black;) until the end of the Ayah. I said to Abu Umamah, `Did you hear this from the Messenger of Allah' He said, `If I only heard it from the Messenger of Allah once, twice, thrice, four times, or seven times, I would not have narrated it to you.' '' At-Tirmidhi said, "This Hadith is Hasan.'' Ibn Majah and Ahmad recorded similarly.  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÂíóÜÊõ Çááøóåö äóÊúáõæåóÇ Úóáóíúßó</div><br>  (These are the Ayat of Allah. We recite them to you) meaning, `These are the verses of Allah, His proofs and signs that We reveal to you, O Muhammad,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (in truth) making known the true reality of this world and the Hereafter.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ Çááøóåõ íõÑöíÏõ ÙõáúãÇğ áøöáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (and Allah wills no injustice to the `Alamin. ) for He never treats them with injustice. Rather, He is the Just Ruler Who is able to do everything and has knowledge of everything. Therefore, He does not need to treat any of His creatures with injustice, and this is why He said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóááøóåö ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (and to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the Earth.),  they are all His servants and His property,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöáóì Çááøóåö ÊõÑúÌóÚõ ÇáÃõãõæÑõ</div><br>  (And all matters go back to Allah,) for His is the decision concerning the affairs of this life and the Hereafter, and His is the Supreme Authority in this life and the Hereafter.  </div></body></html>
