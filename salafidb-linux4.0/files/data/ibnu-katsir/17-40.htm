They made the angels, who are the servants of Ar-Rahman (the Most Beneficent), females, and called them daughters of Allah, then they worshipped them. They were gravely wrong on all three counts. Allah says, denouncing them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÃóÕúİóÜßõãú ÑóÈøõßõã ÈöÇáúÈóäöíäó</div><br>  (Has then your Lord preferred for you sons,) meaning, has He given only you sons   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóÎóĞó ãöäó ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö ÅöäóÇËğÇ</div><br>  (and taken for Himself from among the angels daughters) meaning, has He chosen for Himself, as you claim, daughters Then Allah denounces them even more severely, and says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßõãú áóÊóŞõæáõæäó ŞóæúáÇğ ÚóÙöíãğÇ</div><br>  (Verily, you indeed utter an awful saying.) meaning, in your claim that Allah has children, then you say that His children are female, which you do not like for yourselves and may even kill them by burying them alive.

Indeed you have brought forth (said) a terrible evil thing. Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins. That they ascribe a son child to the Most Beneficent. But it is not suitable for (the majesty of) the Most Beneficent that he should beget a child. There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Beneficent as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And every one of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) (19:88-95)  </div></body></html>
