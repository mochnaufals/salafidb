Say: "No wage do I ask of you for this, nor am I one of the Mutakallifin.'') (87. "It is only a Reminder for all the creatures.'') (88. "And you shall certainly know the truth of it after a while.'')  Allah says: `Say, O Muhammad, to these idolators: I do not ask you to give me any reward from the goods of this world in return for the Message which I convey to you and the sincere advice I offer.'</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóäóÂ ãöäó ÇáúãõÊóßóáøöİöíäó</div><br>  (nor am I one of the Mutakallifin.) means, `and I do not add anything to that which Allah has told me. Whatever I am commanded to do, I do it, and I do not add anything or take anything away. By doing this I am seeking the Face of Allah and the Hereafter.' Sufyan Ath-Thawri, narrated from Al-A`mash and Mansur from Abu Ad-Duha that Masruq said, "We went to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him. He said, `O people! Whoever knows a thing should say it, and whoever does not know should say, `Allah knows best.''' It is part of knowledge, when one does not know, to say "Allah knows best.'' For Allah said to your Prophet :   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ãóÂ ÃóÓúÜóáõßõãú Úóáóíúåö ãöäú ÃóÌúÑò æóãóÂ ÃóäóÂ ãöäó ÇáúãõÊóßóáøöİöíäó </div><br>  (Say: "No wage do I ask of you for this, nor am I one of the Mutakallifin.'')  This was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäú åõæó ÅöáÇøó ĞößúÑñ áøöáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (It is only a Reminder for all the creatures.) means, the Qur'an is a reminder for all those who are held accountable, men and Jinn. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. This Ayah is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøñäĞöÑóßõãú Èöåö æóãóä ÈóáóÛó</div><br>  (that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach) (6:19), and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóßúİõÑú Èöåö ãöäó ÇáÇøñÍúÒóÇÈö İóÇáäøóÇÑõ ãóæúÚöÏõåõ</div><br>  (but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) (11:17).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÊóÚúáóãõäøó äóÈóÃóåõ</div><br>  (And you shall certainly know the truth of it) means, `you will see confirmation that what he says is true.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóÚúÏó Íöíäö</div><br>  (after a while.) means, soon. Qatadah said, "After death. `Ikrimah said, "It means, on the Day of Resurrection.'' There is no contradiction between the two views, because whoever dies comes under the rulings of the Day of Resurrection.  This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Sad. All praise and gratitude is due to Allah, and Allah may He be glorified and exalted, knows best.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
