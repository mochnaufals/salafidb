Each group will be with others like them, Prophets with Prophets, the true believers with their peers, the martyrs with their counterparts, the scholars with their colleagues, every group composed of people of the same kind.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁõæåóÇ</div><br>  (till when they reach it,) means, when they arrive at the gates of Paradise, after passing over the Sirat, where they will be detained on a bridge between Paradise and Hell, and any injustices that existed between them in this world will be settled until they have all been purified from sin through this trial. Then permission will be granted for them to enter Paradise. It was recorded in the Hadith about the Trumpet that when the believers reach the gates of Paradise, they will consult one another as to who should ask permission for them to enter. They will ask Adam, then Nuh, then Ibrahim, then Musa, then `Isa, then Muhammad (may blessings and peace be upon them all). This is akin to what will happen in the arena of judgement, when they will ask for someone to intercede for them with Allah when He comes to pass judgement. This is to show the noble position of Muhammad above the rest of mankind in all situations. In Sahih Muslim, it is reported that Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäóÇ Ãóæøóáõ ÔóİöíÚò İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (I will be the first intercessor in Paradise.)

This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.

They Al-Bukhari and Muslim also produced this from the Hadith of Jabir. It was reported that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÏúÎõáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ãöäú ÃõãøóÊöí ÒõãúÑóÉñ¡ åõãú ÓóÈúÚõæäó ÃóáúİğÇ¡ÊõÖöíÁõ æõÌõæåõåõãú ÅöÖóÇÁóÉó ÇáúŞóãóÑö áóíúáóÉó ÇáúÈóÏúÑ»</div><br>  (A group of my Ummah, seventy thousand, will enter Paradise with their faces shining like the moon on the night when it is full.) `Ukkashah bin Mihsan stood up and said, `O Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me one of them.'

This Hadith -- about the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being brought to account -- was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Jabir bin `Abdullah, `Imran bin Husayn, Ibn Mas`ud, Rifa`ah bin `Arabah Al-Juhani and Umm Qays bint Mihsan -- may Allah be pleased with them all -- and also from Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, may Allah be pleased with them, who said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóíóÏúÎõáóäøó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ãöäú ÃõãøóÊöí ÓóÈúÚõæäó ÃóáúİğÇ Ãóæú ÓóÈúÚõãöÇÆóÉö Ãóáúİò ÂÎöĞñ ÈóÚúÖõåõãú ÈöÈóÚúÖò¡ ÍóÊúì íóÏúÎõáó Ãóæøóáõåõãú æóÂÎöÑõåõãõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó¡ æõÌõæåõåõãú Úóáì ÕõæÑóÉö ÇáúŞóãóÑö áóíúáóÉó ÇáúÈóÏúÑ»</div><br>  (Seventy thousand or seven hundred thousand of my Ummah will surely enter Paradise, holding on to one another, such that the first and last of them will enter Paradise together, with their faces looking like the moon on the night when it is full.)''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁõæåóÇ æóİõÊöÍóÊú ÃóÈúæóÈõåóÇ æóŞóÇáó áóåõãú ÎóÒóäóÊõåóÇ ÓóáóÜãñ ÚóáóíúßõÜãú ØöÈúÊõãú İóÇÏúÎõáõæåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏöíäó</div><br>  (till when they reach it, and its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: "Salam `Alaykum (peace be upon you)! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein forever.'') This is a conditional sentence that is not complete. What it implies is that when they come to the gates of Paradise the gates will be opened for them as a sign of honor, and the angelic gatekeepers will meet them with glad tidings, greetings of peace and praise. Unlike the gatekeepers of Hell who will meet the disbelievers with rebuke and reprimand, the believers will be filled with happiness and joy, each according to his degree of luxury and delights. What happens after this is not mentioned; it is left for the imagination to think of its dearest wishes and be filled with hope. It is known from the Sahih Hadiths that Paradise has eight gates.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóäúİóŞó ÒóæúÌóíúäö ãöäú ãóÇáöåö İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö ÊóÚóÇáóì ÏõÚöíó ãöäú ÃóÈúæóÇÈö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóáöáúÌóäøóÉö ÃóÈúæóÇÈñ¡ İóãóäú ßóÇäó ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö ÏõÚöíó ãöäú ÈóÇÈö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö¡ æóãóäú ßóÇäó ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉö ÏõÚöíó ãöäú ÈóÇÈö ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉö¡ æóãóäú ßóÇäó ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúÌöåóÇÏö ÏõÚöíó ãöäú ÈóÇÈö ÇáúÌöåóÇÏö¡ æóãóäú ßóÇäó ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáÕøöíóÇãö ÏõÚöíó ãöäú ÈóÇÈö ÇáÑøóíøóÇä»</div><br>  (Whoever spends a pair of something from his wealth for the sake of Allah, will be called from the gates of Paradise.
