It commands a complete disavowal of that. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó </div><br>  (Say: "O disbelievers!'') includes every disbeliever on the face of the earth, however, this statement is particularly directed towards the disbelievers of the Quraysh. It has been said that in their ignorance they invited the Messenger of Allah to worship their idols for a year and they would (in turn) worship his God for a year. Therefore, Allah revealed this Surah and in it <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>He commanded His Messenger to disavow himself from their religion completely</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  .  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÃóÚúÈõÏõ ãóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó </div><br>  (I worship not that which you worship.) meaning, statues and rival gods.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÃóäÊõãú ÚóÜÈöÏõæäó ãóÂ ÃóÚúÈõÏõ </div><br>  (Nor will you worship whom I worship.) and He is Allah Alone, Who has no partner. So the word Ma (what) here means Man (who). Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÃóäóÂ ÚóÇÈöÏñ ãøóÇ ÚóÈóÏÊøõãú æóáÇó ÃóäÊõãú ÚóÜÈöÏõæäó ãóÂ ÃóÚúÈõÏõ </div><br>  (And I shall not worship that which you are worshipping. Nor will you worship whom I worship.) meaning, `I do not worship according to your worship, which means that I do not go along with it or follow it. I only worship Allah in the manner in which He loves and is pleased with.' Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÃóäÊõãú ÚóÜÈöÏõæäó ãóÂ ÃóÚúÈõÏõ </div><br>  (Nor will you worship whom I worship.) meaning, `you do not follow the commands of Allah and His Legislation in His worship. Rather, you have invented something out of the promptings of your own souls.' This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä íóÊøóÈöÚõæäó ÅöáÇøó ÇáÙøóäøó æóãóÇ Êóåúæóì ÇáÇøñäİõÓõ æóáóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóåõã ãøöä ÑøóÈøöåöãõ ÇáúåõÏóì</div><br>  (They follow but a guess and that which they themselves desire, whereas there has surely come to them the guidance from their Lord!) (53:23) Therefore, the disavowal is from all of what they are involved. For certainly the worshipper must have a god whom he worships and set acts of worship that he follows to get to him. So the Messenger and his followers worship Allah according to what He has legislated. This is why the statement of Islam is "There is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.'' This means that there is no (true) object of worship except Allah and there is no path to Him (i.e., way of worshipping Him) other than that which the Messenger came with. The idolators worship other than Allah, with acts of worship that Allah has not allowed. This is why the Messenger said to them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóßõãú Ïöíäõßõãú æóáöìó Ïöíäö </div><br>  (To you be your religion, and to me my religion.) This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ßóĞøóÈõæßó İóŞõá áøöì Úóãóáöì æóáóßõãú Úóãóáõßõãú ÃóäÊõãú ÈóÑöíÆõæäó ãöãøóÂ ÃóÚúãóáõ æóÃóäóÇú ÈóÑöìÁñ ãøöãøóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (And if they belie you, say: "For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds! You are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what you do!'') (10:41) and He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóäóÂ ÃóÚúãóÜáõäóÇ æóáóßõãú ÃóÚúãóÜáõßõãú</div><br>  (To us our deeds, and to you your deeds.) (28:55) Al-Bukhari said, "It has been said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóßõãú Ïöíäóßõãú</div><br>  (To you be your religion.) means disbelief.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöìó Ïöíäö</div><br>  (and to me my religion.) means, Islam. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Qul ya Ayyuhal-Kafirun.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
