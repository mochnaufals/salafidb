The story has already been given in detail at the beginning of Surah Maryam and also in Surah `Imran. Here an abbreviated version is given.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú äóÇÏóì ÑóÈøóåõ</div><br>  (when he cried to his Lord) means, in secret, hiding it from his people.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö áÇó ÊóĞóÑúäöì İóÑúÏÇğ</div><br>  (O My Lord! Leave me not single,) means, with no child and no heir to stand among the people after me.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÊó ÎóíúÑõ ÇáúæóÑöËöíäó</div><br>  (though You are the Best of the inheritors.) This is a supplication and form of praise befitting the topic. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÓúÊóÌóÈúäóÇ áóåõ æóæóåóÈúäóÇ áóåõ íóÍúíóì æóÃóÕúáóÍúäóÇ áóåõ ÒóæúÌóåõ</div><br>  (So We answered his call, and We bestowed upon him Yahya, and cured his wife for him.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubayr said: "She was barren and never had a child, then she gave birth.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõãú ßóÇäõæÇú íõÓóÇÑöÚõæäó İöì ÇáúÎóíúÑóÊö</div><br>  (Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds,) means, acts of worship and acts of obedience towards Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÏúÚõæäóäóÇ ÑóÛóÈÇğ æóÑóåóÈÇğ</div><br>  (and they used to call on Us with hope and fear,) Ath-Thawri said, "Hoping for that (reward) which is with Us and fearing that (punishment) which is with Us.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäõæÇú áóäóÇ ÎÜÔöÚöíäó</div><br>  (and they were Khashi`in before Us.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means, sincerely believing in that which was revealed by Allah. Mujahid said: "Truly believing.'' Abu Al-`Aliyah said: "Fearing.'' Abu Sinan said: "Khushu` means the fear which should never leave our hearts.'' It was also reported from Mujahid that the Khashi`in are those who are humble.'' Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak said, "The Khashi`in are those who humble themselves before Allah.'' All of these suggestions are close in meaning.  </div></body></html>
