Then, those whose scales (of good deeds) are heavy, they are the successful. And those whose scales (of good deeds) are light, they are those who lose themselves, in Hell will they abide)23:101-103. As for what will be placed on the Balance on the Day of Resurrection, it has been said that the deeds will be placed on it, even though they are not material objects. Allah will give these deeds physical weight on the Day of Resurrection. Al-Baghawi said that this was reported from Ibn `Abbas. It is recorded in the Sahih that Al-Baqarah (chapter 2) and Al `Imran (chapter 3) will come on the Day of Resurrection in the shape of two clouds, or two objects that provide shade, or two lined groups of birds. It is also recorded in the Sahih that the Qur'an will come to its companion (who used to recite and preserve it) in the shape of a pale-faced young man. He will ask (the young man), "Who are you'' He will reply, "I am the Qur'an, who made you stay up sleeplessly at night and caused you thirst in the day. '' The Hadith that Al-Bara' narrated about the questioning in the grave states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóíóÃúÊöí ÇáúãõÄúãöäó ÔóÇÈøñ ÍóÓóäõ Çááøóæúäö ØóíøöÈõ ÇáÑøöíÍö İóíóŞõæáõ: ãóäú ÃóäúÊó¿ İóíóŞõæáõ: ÃóäóÇ Úóãóáõßó ÇáÕøóÇáöÍ»</div><br>  (A young man with fair color and good scent will come to the believer, who will ask, `Who are you' He will reply, `I am your good deeds'). The Prophet mentioned the opposite in the case of the disbeliever and the hypocrite. It was also said that the Book of Records that contains the deeds will be weighed. A Hadith states that a man will be brought forth and ninety-nine scrolls containing errors and sins will be placed on one side of the balance each as long as the sight can reach. He will then be brought a card on which `La ilaha illallah' will be written. He will say, "O Lord! What would this card weigh against these scrolls'' Allah will say, "You will not be wronged.'' So the card will be placed on the other side of the Balance, and as the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóØóÇÔóÊö ÇáÓøöÌöáøóÇÊõ æóËóŞõáóÊö ÇáúÈöØóÇŞóÉ»</div><br>  (Behold! The (ninety-nine) scrolls will go up, as the card becomes heavier.)  At-Tirmidhi recorded similar wording for this Hadith and said that it is authentic. It was also said that the person who performed the deed will be weighed. A Hadith states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÄúÊóì íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÈöÇáÑøóÌõáö ÇáÓøóãöíäö İóáóÇ íóÒöäõ ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ÌóäóÇÍó ÈóÚõæÖóÉ»</div><br>  (On the Day of Resurrection, a fat man will be brought forth, but he will not weigh with Allah equal to the wing of a mosquito). He then recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó äõŞöíãõ áóåõãú íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö æóÒúäÇğ</div><br>  (And on the Day of Resurrection, We shall assign no weight for them) 18:105.  Also, the Prophet said about `Abdullah bin Mas`ud,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊóÚúÌóÈõæäó ãöäú ÏöŞøóÉö ÓóÇŞóíúåö æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö áóåõãóÇ İöí ÇáúãöíÒóÇäö ÃóËúŞóáõ ãöäú ÃõÍõÏ»</div><br>  (Do you wonder at the thinness of his legs By He in Whose Hand is my soul! They are heavier on the Balance than (Mount) Uhud.) It is also possible to combine the meanings of these Ayat and Hadiths by stating that all this will truly occur, for sometimes the deeds will be weighed, sometimes the scrolls where they are recorded will be weighed, and sometimes those who performed the deeds will be weighed. Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
