When they suffer from doubt, confusion and disbelief, their hearts are,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÕóíøöÈò</div><br>  (Like a Sayyib), meaning, "The rain", as Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, and several other Companions have confirmed as well as Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata', Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Ad-Dahhak said "It is the clouds." However, the most accepted opinion is that it means the rain that comes down during,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÙõáõãóÜÊö</div><br>  (darkness), meaning, here, the doubts, disbelief and hypocrisy.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÚúÏñ</div><br>  (thunder) that shocks the hearts with fear. The hypocrites are usually full of fear and anxiety, just as Allah described them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÍúÓóÈõæäó ßõáøó ÕóíúÍóÉò Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (They think that every cry is against them) (63: 4), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÍúáöİõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö Åöäøóåõãú áóãöäßõãú æóãóÇ åõã ãøöäßõãú æóáóÜßöäøóåõãú Şóæúãñ íóİúÑóŞõæäó - áóæú íóÌöÏõæäó ãóáúÌóÆÇğ Ãóæú ãóÛóÜÑóÇÊò Ãóæú ãõÏøóÎóáÇğ áøóæóáøóæúÇú Åöáóíúåö æóåõãú íóÌúãóÍõæäó </div><br>  (They swear by Allah that they are truly of you while they are not of you, but they are a people who are afraid. Should they find refuge, or caves, or a place of concealment, they would turn straightway thereto in a swift rush) (9:56-57).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÈóÑúŞó</div><br>  (The lightning), is in reference to the light of faith that is sometimes felt in the hearts of the hypocrites,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÌúÚóáõæäó ÃóÕúÜÈöÚóåõãú İöì ÁóÇĞóÇäöåöã ãøöäó ÇáÕøóæóÚöŞö ÍóĞóÑó ÇáúãóæúÊö æóÇááøóåõ ãõÍöíØñ ÈöÇáúßÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah ever encompasses the disbelievers), meaning, their cautiousness does not benefit them because they are bound by Allah's all-encompassing will and decision. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáõ ÃóÊóÇßó ÍóÏöíËõ ÇáúÌõäõæÏö - İöÑúÚóæúäó æóËóãõæÏó - Èóáö ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú İöì ÊóßúĞöíÈò - æóÇááøóåõ ãöä æóÑóÂÆöåöãú ãøõÍöíØñ </div><br>  (Has the story reached you of two hosts. Of Fir`awn (Pharaoh) and Thamud Nay! The disbelievers (persisted) in denying. And Allah encompasses them from behind!) (85:17-20).  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóßóÇÏõ ÇáúÈóÑúŞõ íóÎúØóİõ ÃóÈúÕóÜÑóåõãú</div><br>  F(The lightning almost snatches away their sight) meaning, because the lightning is strong itself, and because their comprehension is weak and does not allow them to embrace the faith. Also, `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóßóÇÏõ ÇáúÈóÑúŞõ íóÎúØóİõ ÃóÈúÕóÜÑóåõãú</div><br>  (The lightning almost snatches away their sight), "The Qur'an mentioned almost all of the secrets of the hypocrites.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah also narrated that Ibn `Abbas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøóãóÂ ÃóÖóÂÁó áóåõã ãøóÔóæúÇú İöíåö</div><br>  (Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein), "Whenever the hypocrites acquire a share in the victories of Islam, they are content with this share. Whenever Islam suffers a calamity, they are ready to revert to disbelief.''. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íóÚúÈõÏõ Çááøóåó Úóáóì ÍóÑúİò İóÅöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóåõ ÎóíúÑñ ÇØúãóÃóäøó Èöåö</div><br>  (And among mankind is he who worships Allah on the edge: If good befalls him, he is content with that.) (22:11). Also, Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøóãóÂ ÃóÖóÂÁó áóåõã ãøóÔóæúÇú İöíåö æóÅöĞóÂ ÃóÙúáóãó Úóáóíúåöãú ŞóÇãõæÇú</div><br>  (Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still), "They recognize the truth and speak about it. So their speech is upright, but when they revert to disbeleif, they again fall into confusion.'' This was also said by Abu Al-`Aliyah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and As-Suddi, who narrated it from the Companions, and it is the most obvious and most correct view, and Allah knows best.  Consequently, on the Day of Judgment, the believers will be given a light according to the degree of their faith. Some of them will gain light that illuminates over a distance of several miles, some more, some less. Some people's light will glow sometimes and be extinguished at other times. They will, therefore, walk on the Sirat (the bridge over the Fire) in the light, stopping when it is extinguished. Some people will have no light at all, these are the hypocrites whom Allah described when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóŞõæáõ ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞõæäó æóÇáúãõäóÜİöŞóÜÊõ áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÇäÙõÑõæäóÇ äóŞúÊóÈöÓú ãöä äøõæÑößõãú Şöíáó ÇÑúÌöÚõæÇú æóÑóÂÁóßõãú İóÇáúÊóãöÓõæÇú äõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (On the Day when the hypocrites Ü men and women Ü will say to the believers: "Wait for us!

Keep perfect our Light for us and do not put it off till we cross over the Sirat (a slippery bridge over the Hell) safely and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things'') (66:8).  Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud commented on,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äõæÑõåõãú íóÓúÚóì Èóíúäó ÃóíúÏöíåöãú</div><br>  (Their Light will run forward before them), "They will pass on the Sirat. according to their deeds. The light that some people have will be as big as a mountain, while the light of others will be as big as a date tree. The people who will have the least light are those whose index fingers will sometimes be lit and extinguished at other times.'' Ibn Abi Hatim also reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "Every person among the people of Tawhid (Islamic Monotheism) will gain a light on the Day of Resurrection. As for the hypocrite, his light will be extinguished. When the believers witness the hypocrite's light being extinguished, they will feel anxious. Hence, they will supplicate,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÊúãöãú áóäóÇ äõæÑóäóÇ</div><br>  (Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us).'' Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim said, "On the Day of Resurrection, everyone who has embraced the faith will be given a light. When they arrive at the Sirat, the light of the hypocrites will be extinguished. When the believers see this, they will feel anxious and supplicate,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÊúãöãú áóäóÇ äõæÑóäóÇ</div><br>  (Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us).'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Types of Believers and Types of Disbelievers</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Consequently, there are several types of people. There are the believers whom the first four Ayat (2:2-5) in Surat Al-Baqarah describe. There are the disbelievers who were described in the next two Ayat. And there are two categories of hypocrites: the complete hypocrites who were mentioned in the parable of the fire, and the hesitant hypocrites, whose light of faith is sometimes lit and sometimes extinguished. The parable of the rain was revealed about this category, which is not as evil as the first category.  This is similar to the parables that were given in Surat An-Nur (chapter 24). Like the example of the believer and the faith that Allah put in his heart, compared to a brightly illuminated lamp, just like a rising star. This is the believer, whose heart is built on faith and receiving its support from the divine legislation that was revealed to it, without any impurities or imperfections, as we will come to know, Allah willing.  Allah gave a parable of the disbelievers who think that they have something, while in reality they have nothing; such people are those who have compounded ignorance. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÃóÚúãóÜáõåõãú ßóÓóÑóÇÈò ÈöŞöíÚóÉò íóÍúÓóÈõåõ ÇáÙøóãúÂäõ ãóÂÁğ ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõ áóãú íóÌöÏúåõ ÔóíúÆÇğ</div><br>  (As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing) (24:39).  Allah then gave the example of ignorant disbelievers, simple in their ignorance. He said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ßóÙõáõãóÜÊò İöì ÈóÍúÑò áøõÌøöìøò íóÛúÔóÜåõ ãóæúÌñ ãøöä İóæúŞöåö ãóæúÌñ ãøöä İóæúŞöåö ÓóÍóÇÈñ ÙõáõãóÜÊñ ÈóÚúÖõåóÇ İóæúŞó ÈóÚúÖò ÅöĞóÂ ÃóÎúÑóÌó íóÏóåõ áóãú íóßóÏú íóÑóÇåóÇ æóãóä áøóãú íóÌúÚóáö Çááøóåõ áóåõ äõæÑÇğ İóãóÇ áóåõ ãöä äõæÑò </div><br>  (Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed by waves, topped by dark clouds, (layers of) darkness upon darkness: if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, for him there is no light) (24:40).  Therefore, Allah divided the camp of the disbelievers into two groups, advocates and followers. Allah mentioned these two groups in the beginning of Surat Al-Hajj,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íõÌóÜÏöáõ İöì Çááøóåö ÈöÛóíúÑö Úöáúãò æóíóÊøóÈöÚõ ßõáøó ÔóíúØóÜäò ãøóÑöíÏò </div><br>  (And among mankind is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge, and follows every rebellious (disobedient to Allah) Shaytan (devil) (devoid of every kind of good)) (22:3), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íõÌóÜÏöáõ İöì Çááøóåö ÈöÛóíúÑö Úöáúãò æóáÇó åõÏğì æóáÇó ßöÊóÜÈò ãøõäöíÑò </div><br>  (And among men is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light (from Allah)) (22:8).  Furthermore, Allah has divided the group of the believers in the beginning of Surat Al-Waqi`ah (56) and at the end. He also divided them in Surat Al-Insan (76) into two groups, the Sabiqun (those who preceded), they are the "near ones" (Muqaribun) and Ashab Al-Yamin (the companions of the right), and they are righteous (Abrar).  In summary, these Ayat divide the believers into two categories, the near ones and righteous. Also, the disbelievers are of two types, advocates and followers. In addition, the hypocrites are divided into two types, pure hypocrites and those who have some hypocrisy in them. The Two Sahihs record that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ËóáóÇËñ ãóäú ßõäøó İöíåö ßóÇäó ãõäóÇİöŞğÇ ÎóÇáöÕğÇ¡ æóãóäú ßóÇäóÊú İöíåö æóÇÍöÏóÉñ ãöäúåõäøó ßóÇäóÊú İöíåö ÎóÕúáóÉñ ãöäó ÇáäøöİóÇŞö ÍóÊøóì íóÏóÚóåóÇ: ãóäú ÅöĞóÇ ÍóÏøóËó ßóĞóÈó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ æóÚóÏó ÃóÎúáóİó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÇÆúÊõãöäó ÎóÇä»</div><br>  (Whoever has the following three (characteristics) will be a pure hypocrite, and whoever has one of the following three characteristics will have one characteristic of hypocrisy, unless and until he gives it up. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie. Whenever he makes a covenant, he proves treacherous. Whenever he is entrusted, he breaches the trust)  Hence, man might have both a part of faith and a part of hypocrisy, whether in deed, as this Hadith stipulates, or in the creed, as the Ayah (2:20) stipulates. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Types of Hearts</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Sa`id saying that the Messenger of Allah said   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúŞõáõæÈõ ÃóÑúÈóÚóÉñ: ŞóáúÈñ ÃóÌúÑóÏõ İöíåö ãöËúáõ ÇáÓøöÑóÇÌö íóÒúåóÑõ æóŞóáúÈñ ÃóÛúáóİõ ãóÑúÈõæØñ Úóáì ÛöáóÇİöåö æóŞóáúÈñ ãóäúßõæÓñ æóŞóáúÈñ ãõÕúİóÍñ¡ İóÃóãøóÇ ÇáúŞóáúÈõ ÇáúÃóÌúÑóÏõ İóŞóáúÈõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäö İóÓöÑóÇÌõåõ İöíåö äõæÑõåõ¡ æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáúŞóáúÈõ ÇáúÃóÛúáóİõ İóŞóáúÈõ ÇáúßóÇİöÑö¡ æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáúŞóáúÈõ ÇáúãóäúßõæÓõ İóŞóáúÈõ ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞö ÇáúÎóÇáöÕö ÚóÑóİó Ëõãøó ÃóäúßóÑó æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáúŞóáúÈõ ÇáúãõÕúİóÍõ İóŞóáúÈñ İöíåö ÅíãóÇäñ æóäöİóÇŞñ æóãóËóáõ ÇáúÅíãóÇäö İöíåö ßóãóËóáö ÇáúÈóŞúáóÉö íóãõÏøõåóÇ ÇáúãóÇÁõ ÇáØøóíøöÈõ æóãóËóáõ ÇáäøöİóÇŞö İöíåö ßóãóËóáö ÇáúŞõÑúÍóÉö íóãõÏøõåóÇ ÇáúŞóíúÍõ æóÇáÏøóãõ İóÃóíøõ ÇáúãóÇÏøóÊóíúäö ÛóáóÈóÊú Úóáóì ÇáúÃõÎúÑóì ÛóáóÈóÊú Úóáóíúå»</div><br>  (The hearts are four (types): polished as shiny as the radiating lamp, a sealed heart with a knot tied around its seal, a heart that is turned upside down and a wrapped heart. As for the polished heart, it is the heart of the believer and the lamp is the light of faith. The sealed heart is the heart of the disbeliever. The heart that is turned upside down is the heart of the pure hypocrite, because he had knowledge but denied it. As for the wrapped heart, it is a heart that contains belief and hypocrisy. The example of faith in this heart, is the example of the herb that is sustained by pure water. The example of hypocrisy in it, is the example of an ulcer that thrives on puss and blood. Whichever of the two substances has the upper hand, it will have the upper hand on that heart). This Hadith has a Jayid Hasan (good) chain of narration.  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ áóĞóåóÈó ÈöÓóãúÚöåöãú æóÃóÈúÕóÜÑöåöãú Åöäøó Çááøóåó Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ</div><br>  (And if Allah willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight. Certainly, Allah has power over all things). Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ áóĞóåóÈó ÈöÓóãúÚöåöãú æóÃóÈúÕóÜÑöåöãú</div><br>  (And if Allah willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight), "Because they abandoned the truth after they had knowledge in it.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ</div><br>  (Certainly, Allah has power over all things). Ibn `Abbas said, "Allah is able to punish or pardon His servants as He wills.'' Ibn Jarir commented, "Allah only described Himself with the ability to do everything in this Ayah as a warning to the hypocrites of His control over everything, and to inform them that His ability completely encompasses them and that He is able to take away their hearing and sight.''  Ibn Jarir and several other scholars of Tafsir stated that these two parables are about the same kind of hypocrite. So the `or' mentioned in,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ßóÕóíøöÈò ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö</div><br>  (Or like a rainstorm from the sky) means `and', just as the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊõØöÚú ãöäúåõãú ÁóÇËöãÇğ Ãóæú ßóİõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (And obey neither a sinner or a disbeliever among them). Therefore, `or' in the Ayah includes a choice of using either example for the hypocrites. Also, Al-Qurtubi said that `or' means, "To show compatibility of the two choices, just as when one says, `Sit with Al-Hasan or Ibn Sirin.' According to the view of Az-Zamakhshari, `so it means each of these persons is the same as the other, so you may sit with either one of them.' The meaning of `or' thus becomes `either.' Allah gave these two examples of the hypocrites, because they both perfectly describe them.''  I (Ibn Kathir) say, these descriptions are related to the type of hypocrite, because there is a difference between them as we stated. For instance, Allah mentioned these types in Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9) when He repeated the statement, "And among them'' three times, describing their types, characteristics, statements and deeds. So the two examples mentioned here describe two types of hypocrites whose characteristics are similar. For instance, Allah gave two examples in Surat An-Nur, one for the advocates of disbelief and one for the followers of disbelief, He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÃóÚúãóÜáõåõãú ßóÓóÑóÇÈò ÈöŞöíÚóÉò</div><br>  (As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert) (24:39), until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ßóÙõáõãóÜÊò İöì ÈóÍúÑò áøõÌøöìøò</div><br>  (Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea) (24:40).  The first example is of the advocates of disbelief who have complex ignorance, while the second is about the followers who have simple ignorance. Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
