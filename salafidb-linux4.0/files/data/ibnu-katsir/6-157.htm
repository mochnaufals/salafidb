Why did You not send us a Messenger We would then have followed Your Ayat.'')28:47.'' The Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóì ØóÂÆöİóÊóíúäö ãöä ŞóÈúáöäóÇ</div><br>  (to two sects before us) refers to the Jews and Christians, according to `Ali bin Abi Talhah who narrated it from Ibn `Abbas. Similar was reported from Mujahid, As-Suddi, Qatadah and several others. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ßõäøóÇ Úóä ÏöÑóÇÓóÊöåöãú áóÛóÜİöáöíäó</div><br>  ("...and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.") meaning: `we did not understand what they said because the revelation was not in our tongue. We, indeed, were busy and unaware of their message,' so they said. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÊóŞõæáõæÇú áóæú ÃóäøóÂ ÃõäÒöáó ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈõ áóßõäøóÂ ÃóåúÏóì ãöäúåõãú</div><br>  (Or lest you should say: "If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely, have been better guided than they.") meaning: We also refuted this excuse, had you used it, lest you say, "If a Book was revealed to us, just as they received a Book, we would have been better guided than they are.'' Allah also said.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóŞúÓóãõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö ÌóåúÏó ÃóíúãóÜäöåöãú áóÆöä ÌóÂÁóåõãú äóĞöíÑñ áøóíóßõæäõäøó ÃóåúÏóì ãöäú ÅöÍúÏóì ÇáÇøòãóãö</div><br>  (And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations (before them).) 35:42 Allah replied here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßõãú ÈóíøöäóÉñ ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú æóåõÏğì æóÑóÍúãóÉñ</div><br>  (So now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy.) Allah says, there has come to you from Allah a Glorious Qur'an revealed to Muhammad , the Arab Prophet. In it is the explanation of the lawful and unlawful matters, guidance for the hearts and mercy from Allah to His servants who follow and implement it. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóäú ÃóÙúáóãõ ãöãøóä ßóĞøóÈó ÈöÂíóÜÊö Çááøóåö æóÕóÏóİó ÚóäúåóÇ</div><br>  (Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the Ayat of Allah and Sadafa away therefrom) This refers to the one who neither benefited from what the Messenger brought, nor followed what he was sent with by abandoning all other ways. Rather, he Sadafa from following the Ayat of Allah, meaning, he discouraged and hindered people from following it. This is the explanation of As-Suddi for Sadafa, while Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah said that Sadafa means, he turned away from it.  </div></body></html>
