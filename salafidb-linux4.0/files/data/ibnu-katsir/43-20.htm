Similarly, out of the two kinds of offspring, sons and daughters, they assigned to Him the worst and least valuable (in their eyes), i.e., daughters, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóßõãõ ÇáĞøóßóÑõ æóáóåõ ÇáÇøòäËóì - Êöáúßó ÅöĞÇğ ŞöÓúãóÉñ ÖöíÒóì </div><br>  (Is it for you the males and for Him the females That indeed is a division most unfair!)

Allah says, so how can they dislike that so much and yet they attribute it to Allah   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæóãóä íõäóÔøóÃõ İöì ÇáúÍöáúíóÉö æóåõæó İöì ÇáúÎöÕóÇãö ÛóíúÑõ ãõÈöíäò </div><br>  (A creature who is brought up in adornments, and who in dispute cannot make itself clear) means, women are regarded as lacking something, which they make up for with jewelry and adornments from the time of childhood onwards, and when there is a dispute, they cannot speak up and defend themselves clearly, so how can this be attributed to Allah   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáõæÇú ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉó ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú ÚöÈóÇÏõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÅöäóÜËÇğ</div><br>  (And they make females the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious.) means, that is what they believe about them, but Allah denounces them for that and says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÔóåöÏõæÇú ÎóáúŞóåõãú</div><br>  (Did they witness their creation) meaning, did they see Allah creating them as females   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÊõßúÊóÈõ ÔóåóÜÏóÊõåõãú</div><br>  (Their testimony will be recorded,) means, concerning that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÓúÜóáõæäó</div><br>  (and they will be questioned!) means, about that, on the Day of Resurrection.

By saying this, they combined several types of error: First: They attributed offspring to Allah -- exalted and sanctified be He far above that. Second: They claimed that He chose daughters rather than sons, and they made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, female. Third: They worshipped them with no proof, evidence or permission from Allah. This was based on mere opinion, whims and desires, imitation of their elders and forefathers, and pure ignorance. They used Allah's decree as an excuse, and this reasoning betrayed their ignorance. Fourth: Allah denounced them for this in the strongest terms, for from the time He first sent Messengers and revealed Books, the command was to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate, and it was forbidden to worship anything other than Him.
