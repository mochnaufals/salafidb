But the share of their "partners'' is not directed to Allah, while the share of Allah is directed to their "partners''! How evil is that with which they judge) (6:136) That is they assigned a share for their idols as well as Allah, but they gave preference to their gods over Him, so Allah swore by His Almighty Self to question them about these lies and fabrications. He will most certainly call them to account for it and give them the unrelenting punishment in the fire of Hell.

Then Allah tells us how they used to regard the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, as being female, and that they considered them to be Allah's daughters, and they worshipped them with Him. In all of the above, they made very serious errors. They attributed offspring to Him when He has no offspring, then they assigned Him the kind of offspring they regarded as inferior, namely daughters, which they did not even want for themselves, as He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóßõãõ ÇáĞøóßóÑõ æóáóåõ ÇáÇøòäËóì - Êöáúßó ÅöĞÇğ ŞöÓúãóÉñ ÖöíÒóì </div><br>  (Are the males for you and the females for Him That is indeed an unfair division!)
