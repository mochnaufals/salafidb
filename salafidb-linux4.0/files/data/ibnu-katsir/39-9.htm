It was reported that Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "The obedient one is one who obeys Allah and His Messenger .'' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Al-Hasan, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said, Ana'a Al-Layl means in the depths of the night.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÍúĞóÑõ ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉó æóíóÑúÌõæÇú ÑóÍúãóÉó ÑóÈøöåö</div><br>  (fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord.) means, in his worship he feels both fear and hope. Both are essential in worship, and fear should be stronger during one's lifetime.

This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i in Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, and Ibn Majah from the Hadith of Yasar bin Hatim from Ja`far bin Sulayman. At-Tirmidhi said, "Gharib.'' Imam Ahmad recorded that Tamim Ad-Dari, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ŞóÑóÃó ÈöãöÇÆóÉö ÂíóÉò İöí áóíúáóÉò ßõÊöÈó áóåõ ŞõäõæÊõ áóíúáóÉ»</div><br>  (Whoever recites one hundred Ayat in one night, it will be recorded as if he prayed all night.)
