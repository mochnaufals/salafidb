When the offspring of the righteous believers imitate their parents regarding faith, Allah will elevate the latter to the ranks of the former, even though the latter did not perform deeds as goodly as their parents. Allah will comfort the eyes of the parents by seeing their offspring elevated to their grades. Surely, Allah will gather them together in the best manner, and He will not decrease the reward or the grades of those higher in rank for joining them together, hence His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáúÍóŞúäóÇ Èöåöãú ĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõãú æóãóÂ ÃóáóÊúäóÜåõãú ãøöäú Úóãóáöåöã ãøöä ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ath-Thawri reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "Verily, Allah elevates the ranks of the believers' offspring to rank of their parents, even though the latter have not performed as well as the former, so that the eyes of the parents are comforted.'' Ibn `Abbas then recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÇÊøóÈóÚóÊúåõãú ĞõÑøöíøóÊõåõã ÈöÅöíãóÜäò ÃóáúÍóŞúäóÇ Èöåöãú ĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõãú æóãóÂ ÃóáóÊúäóÜåõãú ãøöäú Úóãóáöåöã ãøöä ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement from Sufyan Ath-Thawri from Ibn `Abbas. Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÇÊøóÈóÚóÊúåõãú ĞõÑøöíøóÊõåõã ÈöÅöíãóÜäò ÃóáúÍóŞúäóÇ Èöåöãú ĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõãú</div><br>  (And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring.) saying, "They are the offspring of the believers who died on the faith. If the ranks of their parents are higher than their ranks, they will be joined with their parents. No part of the reward their parents received for their good deeds will be reduced for them.'' `Abdullah, son of Imam Ahmad, recorded that `Ali said, "Khadijah asked the Prophet about two of her children who died during the time of Jahiliyyah, and the Messenger of Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åõãóÇ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (They are both in the Fire.) When he saw sadness on her face, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú ÑóÃóíúÊö ãóßóÇäóåõãóÇ áóÃóÈúÛóÖúÊöåöãóÇ»</div><br>  (If you saw their dwelling place, you would hate them.) She said, `O Allah's Messenger! What about my children with you.' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (They are in Paradise.) The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó æóÃóæúáóÇÏóåõãú İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáúãõÔúÑößöíäó æóÃóæúáóÇÏóåõãú İöí ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (Verily, the believers and their offspring will dwell in Paradise, while the idolators and their offspring will dwell in the Hellfire.) The Prophet then recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÇÊøóÈóÚóÊúåõãú ĞõÑøöíøóÊõåõã ÈöÅöíãóÜäò</div><br>  (And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith...)'' Certainly, it is Allah's grace and favor that He grants the children this blessing because of the good deeds of their parents. He also grants His favor to parents on account of their offspring invoking Allah for them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó áóíóÑúİóÚõ ÇáÏøóÑóÌóÉó áöáúÚóÈúÏö ÇáÕøóÇáöÍö İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö İóíóŞõæáõ: íóÇ ÑóÈøö Ãóäúì áöí åĞöåö¿ İóíóŞõæáõ: ÈöÇÓúÊöÛúİóÇÑö æóáóÏößó áóß»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah shall elevate the grade of a righteous servant in Paradise, who will ask, "O Lord! How did I earn this'' Allah will reply, "Through your son's invoking Me to forgive you.'') This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration, but it was not recorded in the Sahih this way. However, there is a witnessing narration for it in Sahih Muslim, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ãóÇÊó ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó ÇäúŞóØóÚó Úóãóáõåõ ÅöáøóÇ ãöäú ËóáóÇËò: ÕóÏóŞóÉò ÌóÇÑöíóÉò¡ Ãóæú Úöáúãò íõäúÊóİóÚõ Èöåö¡ Ãóæú æóáóÏò ÕóÇáöÍò íóÏúÚõæ áóå»</div><br>  (When the Son of Adam dies, his record of deeds will cease except in three cases: an ongoing charity, knowledge that people are benefiting from and a righteous son who invokes Allah for him.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah is Just with the Sinners</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøõ ÇãúÑöìÁò ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈó Ñóåóíäñ</div><br>  (Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) After Allah mentioned His favor of elevating the offspring to the ranks of their parents, even though the deeds of the former did not qualify them, He affirmed His fairness in that, He does not punish anyone for the mistakes of others,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøõ ÇãúÑöìÁò ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈó Ñóåóíäñ</div><br>  (Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) Therefore, every person will be responsible for his actions. No sin committed by others shall ever be added to one's load, even if committed by his or her parents or offspring.

Ibn `Abbas said that Laghw means `falsehood' while Ta'thim means `lying'. Mujahid said, "They do not curse each other nor sin.'' Qatadah said, "These were the consequences of drinking in this life, and Shaytan helped in this regard. Allah purified the wine of the Hereafter from the ills and harm caused by the wine of this life.'' Therefore, Allah has purified the wine of the Hereafter from causing headaches, stomachaches and intoxication like the wine of this life. Allah stated that wine of the Hereafter shall not cause those who drink it to utter false, vain words that carry no benefit, full of foolishness and evil. Allah also described the wine of the Hereafter as beautiful in appearance, tasty and fruitful,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóíúÖóÂÁó áóĞøóÉò áøöáÔøóÜÑöÈöíäó - áÇó İöíåóÇ Ûóæúáñ æóáÇó åõãú ÚóäúåóÇ íõäÒóİõæäó </div><br>  (White, delicious to the drinkers.
