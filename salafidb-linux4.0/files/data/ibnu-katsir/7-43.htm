Then, transgression that occurred between them in the life of this world will be judged. Until, when they are purified and cleansed, they will be given permission to enter Paradise. By He in Whose Hand is my soul! One of them will be able to find his dwelling in Paradise more so than he did in the life of this world.)

They will drink from one of them, and all hatred will be removed from their hearts, for it is the cleansing drink. They will take a bath in the other, and the brightness of delight will radiate from their faces. Ever after, they will never have messy hair or become dirty.'' An-Nasa'i and Ibn Marduwyah (this being his wording) recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáøõ Ãóåúáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö íóÑóì ãóŞúÚóÏóåõ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ İóíóŞõæáõ: áóæúáóÇ Ãóäøó Çááåó åóÏóÇäöí¡ İóíóßõæäõ áóåõ ÔõßúÑğÇ¡ æóßõáøõ Ãóåúáö ÇáäøóÇÑö íóÑóì ãóŞúÚóÏóåõ ãöäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö İóíóŞõæáõ: áóæú Ãóäøó Çááåó åóÏóÇäöí¡ İóíóßõæäõ áóåõ ÍóÓúÑóÉ»</div><br>  (Each of the people of Paradise will see his seat in the Fire and he will say, `Had not Allah guided me! And this will cause him to be grateful. Each of the people of the Fire will see his seat in Paradise, and he will say, `Might that Allah had guided me!' So it will be a cause of anguish for him.) This is why when the believers are awarded seats in Paradise that belonged to the people of the Fire, they will be told, "This is the Paradise that you inherited because of what you used to do. '' This means, because of your good deeds, you earned Allah's mercy and thus entered Paradise and took your designated dwellings in it, comparable to your deeds. This is the proper meaning here, for it is recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇÚúáóãõæÇ Ãóäøó ÃóÍóÏóßõãú áóäú íõÏúÎöáóåõ Úóãóáõåõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (And know that the good deeds of one of you will not admit him into Paradise.)
