When the Messenger of Allah migrated to Al-Madinah, the people were consuming alcohol and gambling, so they asked the Messenger of Allah about these things, Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÜóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáúÎóãúÑö æóÇáúãóíúÓöÑö Şõáú İöíåöãóÂ ÅöËúãñ ßóÈöíÑñ æóãóäóÜİöÚõ áöáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (They ask you about alcoholic drink and gambling.

So they went on drinking Khamr until one day, one of the emigrants lead his companions in the Maghrib prayer and mixed up the Ayat in his recitation.

Later, some people said, `O Allah's Messenger! Some people died in the cause of Allah, while some others died in their beds, but they used to drink alcohol and indulge in gambling, which Allah has made a Rijs of the work of Shaytan.' So Allah sent down,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó Úóáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö ÌõäóÇÍñ İöíãóÇ ØóÚöãõæÇú</div><br>  (Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate...) 5:93, until the end of the Ayah.

Ahmad recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "O Allah! Explain the verdict about Khamr to us clearly.'' The Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÜóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáúÎóãúÑö æóÇáúãóíúÓöÑö Şõáú İöíåöãóÂ ÅöËúãñ ßóÈöíÑñ</div><br>  (They ask you about alcoholic drink and gambling.

Make the verdict concerning Khamr clear to us.'' Then, the Ayah in Surat Al-Ma'idah 5:91 was revealed, and `Umar was summoned and it was recited to him. When he reached the part of the Ayah that reads,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóáú ÃóäúÊõãú ãøõäÊóåõæäó</div><br>  (So, will you not then abstain)5:91, `Umar said, "We abstained, we abstained.'' Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith. `Ali bin Al-Madini and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs, that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said in a speech; while standing on the Minbar of the Messenger of Allah (in the Prophet's Masjid in Al-Madinah) "O people! The prohibition of Khamr was revealed; and Khamr was extracted from five things: From grapes, dates, honey, wheat and barley. Khamr is what intoxicates the mind.'' Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Umar said, "The prohibition of Khamr was revealed when there were five kinds of intoxicants in Al-Madinah, besides what was produced from grapes.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Hadith</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said, "I once was giving an alcoholic beverage to Abu `Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah, `Ubayy bin Ka`b, Suhayl bin Bayda' and several of their friends meeting at Abu Talhah's house. When they were almost intoxicated, some Muslims came and said, `Did you not know that Khamr has been prohibited' They said, `We'll wait and ask.' They then said, `O Anas! Spill the remaining alcohol out of your container.' By Allah! They never drank it again, and their Khamr at that time was made from unripe and normal dates.''' This is also recorded in the Two Sahihs. In another narration by Anas, "I was the butler of the people in the house of Abu Talhah when Khamr was prohibited, and in those days alcohol was made from unripe and normal dates. A caller then heralded, and Abu Talhah ordered me to see what it was about. So I found that a person was announcing that alcoholic drinks had been prohibited. Abu Talhah ordered me to go out and spill the wine. I went out and spilled it, and it flowed in the streets of Al-Madinah. Some people said, `Some people were killed and wine was still in their stomachs.' Later on, Allah's revelation came,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó Úóáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö ÌõäóÇÍñ İöíãóÇ ØóÚöãõæÇú</div><br>  (Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate...)5:93.'' Ibn Jarir recorded that Anas bin Malik said, "I was serving Abu Talhah, Abu `Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah, Abu Dujanah, Mu`adh bin Jabal and Suhayl bin Bayda', until they became intoxicated from an alcoholic drink made of mixed unripe and normal dates. Then I heard someone herald, `Khamr has been made illegal.' So no one went in or out until we spilled the alcohol and broke its barrels. Some of us then performed ablution and others took a shower, and we wore some perfume. We then went out to the Masjid while the Messenger of Allah was reciting,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÂãóäõæÇú ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáúÎóãúÑõ æóÇáúãóíúÓöÑõ æóÇáÇøñäÕóÇÈõ æóÇáÇøñÒúáÇóãõ ÑöÌúÓñ ãøöäú Úóãóáö ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö İóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæåõ</div><br>  (O you who believe!

Khamr itself was cursed, whoever drinks it, its server, seller, buyer, brewer, who asks for it to be brewed, whoever carries it, whomever it is carried to and whoever consumes its price.) Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith. Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said, "Once, the Messenger of Allah went out and I went out with him. I walked to his right, but Abu Bakr came along and I gave way to him, and Abu Bakr was walking on the Prophet's right, while I was walking on his left. Then `Umar came along and he was walking on the Prophet's left, since I gave way to him. The Messenger of Allah then found a leather skin hanging containing alcohol, so he asked for a knife and ordered that the skin be cut open. He then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áõÚöäóÊö ÇáúÎóãúÑõ æóÔóÇÑöÈõåóÇ¡ æóÓóÇŞöíåóÇ¡ æóÈóÇÆöÚõåóÇ¡ æóãõÈúÊóÇÚõåóÇ¡ æóÍóÇãöáõåóÇ¡ æóÇáúãóÍúãõæáóÉõ Åöáóíúåö¡ æóÚóÇÕöÑõåóÇ æóãõÚúÊóÕöÑõåóÇ¡ æóÂßöáõ ËóãóäöåóÇ»</div><br>  (Khamr was cursed, and so are those who drink it, serve it, sell it, buy it, carry it, have it carried to them, brew it, have it brewed and consume its price.)'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Hadith</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi recorded that Sa`d said, "There were four Ayat revealed about Khamr...'' He then said, "A man from Al-Ansar made some food and invited us. We drank Khamr before it was prohibited and became intoxicated, and thus started to boast about our status. The Ansar said that they were better, while Quraysh (the Muhajirin) said that they were better. So a man from the Ansar took a bone and struck Sa`d's nose with it and made a flesh wound on it. Ever since that happened, Sa`d's nose had a scar from that wound.

And Khamr is bitter for those who taste it. Allah has vowed by His grace and power, `Whoever drinks it after I prohibited it, I will make him thirsty on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever abandons it after I prohibited it, I will let him taste it in the residence of Grace (Paradise).''' Its chain of narration is Sahih <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Hadith</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ash-Shafi`i narrated that Malik narrated that Nafi` said that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÔóÑöÈó ÇáúÎóãúÑó İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ Ëõãøó áóãú íóÊõÈú ãöäúåóÇ ÍõÑöãóåóÇ İöí ÇáÂÎöÑóÉ»</div><br>  (Whoever drinks Khamr in the life of this world and does not repent from it, will be deprived of it in the Hereafter.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith. Muslim recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáøõ ãõÓúßöÑò ÎóãúÑñ¡ æóßõáøõ ãõÓúßöÑò ÍóÑóÇãñ¡ æóãóäú ÔóÑöÈó ÇáúÎóãúÑó İóãóÇÊó æóåõæó íõÏúãöäõåóÇ æóáóãú íóÊõÈú ãöäúåóÇ¡ áóãú íóÔúÑóÈúåóÇ İöí ÇáúÂÎöÑóÉ»</div><br>  (Every intoxicant is Khamr, and every intoxicant is unlawful. Whoever drinks Khamr and dies while addicted to it, without repenting from drinking it, will not drink it in the Hereafter.) `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith bin Hisham said that he heard `Uthman bin `Affan saying, "Avoid Khamr, for it is the mother of all sins. There was a man before your time who used to worship Allah secluded from the people. Later, an evil woman loved him and sent her female servant to him saying that they wanted him to witness something. So he went with the servant. Whenever they went through the door, she locked it behind them, until he reached a beautiful woman with a young servant boy and some alcohol. She said to him, `By Allah! I did not invite you to be a witness for anything, but called you to have sex with me, kill this boy or drink this alcohol.' So she gave him some alcohol, and he kept asking for more until he became intoxicated and had sex with her and killed the boy. Therefore, avoid Khamr, because it is never combined with faith, but one of them is bound to expel the other (from the heart).'' This was recorded by Al-Bayhaqi. This statement has an authentic chain of narration. Abu Bakr bin Abi Ad-Dunya recorded this statement in his book on the prohibition of intoxicants, but he related it from the Prophet. Relating it from `Uthman is more authentic, and Allah knows best. Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "When Khamr was prohibited, some people said, `O Allah's Messenger!
