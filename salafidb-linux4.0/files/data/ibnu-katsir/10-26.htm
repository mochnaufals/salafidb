For those who have done good is the best, and even more. Neither darkness nor dust nor any humiliating disgrace shall cover their faces. They are the dwellers of Paradise, they will abide therein forever.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reward of the Good-Doers</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah states that those who do good in this world -- by having faith and performing righteous deeds -- will be rewarded with a good reward in the Hereafter. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú ÌóÒóÂÁõ ÇáÅöÍúÓóÜäö ÅöáÇøó ÇáÅöÍúÓóÜäõ </div><br>  (Is there any reward for good other than good)(55:60) Then Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÒöíóÇÏóÉñ</div><br>  (and even more.) the reward on the good deeds multiplied ten times to seven hundred times and even more on top of that. This reward includes what Allah will give them in Paradise, such as the palaces, Al-Hur (virgins of Paradise), and His pleasure upon them. He will give them what He has hidden for them of the delight of the eye. He will grant them on top of all of that and even better, the honor of looking at His Noble Face. This is the increase that is greater than anything that had been given. They will not deserve that because of their deeds, but rather, they will receive it by the grace of Allah and His mercy.  The explanation that this refers to looking at Allah's Noble Face was narrated from Abu Bakr, Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman, `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla, `Abdur-Rahman bin Sabit, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Amir bin Sa`ad, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Muhammad bin Ishaq, and others from the earlier and later scholars. There are many Hadiths that contain the same interpretation. Among these Hadiths is what Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that Allah's Messenger recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöáøóĞöíäó ÃóÍúÓóäõæÇú ÇáúÍõÓúäóì æóÒöíóÇÏóÉñ</div><br>  (For those who have done good is the best and even more.) And then he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÏóÎóáó Ãóåúáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÇáúÌóäøóÉó æóÃóåúáõ ÇáäøóÇÑö ÇáäøóÇÑó äóÇÏóì ãõäóÇÏò: íóÇ Ãóåúáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö Åöäøó áóßõãú ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ãóæúÚöÏğÇ íõÑíÏõ Ãóäú íõäúÌöÒóßõãõæåõ İóíóŞõæáõæäó: æóãóÇ åõæó¿ Ãóáóãú íõËóŞøöáú ãóæóÇÒöíäóäóÇ¿ Ãóáóãú íõÈóíøöÖú æõÌõæåóäóÇ æóíõÏúÎöáúäóÇ ÇáúÌóäøóÜÜÉó æóíõÌöÑúäóÇ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö¿ ŞóÇáó İóíóßúÔöİõ áóåõãõ ÇáúÍöÌóÇÈó¡ İóíóäúÙõÑõæäó Åöáóíåö¡ İóæóÇááåö ãóÇ ÃóÚúØóÇåõãú Çááåõ ÔóíúÆğÇ ÃóÍóÈøó Åöáóíúåöãú ãöäó ÇáäøóÙóÑö Åöáóíúåö¡ æóáóÇ ÃóŞóÑøó áöÃóÚúíõäöåöã»</div><br>  (When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, a caller will say: `O people of Paradise, Allah has promised you something that He wishes to fulfill.' They will reply: `What is it Has He not made our Scale heavy Has He not made our faces white and delivered us from Fire' Allah will then remove the veil and they will see Him. By Allah, they have not been given anything dearer to them and more delightful than looking at Him.) Muslim and a group of Imams also related this Hadith. Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÑúåóŞõ æõÌõæåóåõãú ŞóÊóÑñ</div><br>  (Neither darkness nor dust shall cover their faces. ..) meaning, no blackness or darkness will be on their faces during the different events of the Day of Judgment. But the faces of the rebellious disbelievers will be stained with dust and darkness.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ĞöáøóÉñ</div><br>  (nor any humiliating disgrace) meaning, they will be covered with degradation and disgrace. The believers, however will not be humiliated internally or externally, on the contrary, they will be protected and honored. For as Allah has said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóæóŞóÜåõãõ Çááøóåõ ÔóÑøó Ğóáößó Çáúíóæãö æóáóŞøóÜåõãú äóÖúÑóÉğ æóÓõÑõæÑÇğ </div><br>  l(So Allah saved them from the evil of that Day, and gave them Nadrah (brightness) and joy.) 76:11 meaning, light in their faces and delight in their hearts. May Allah make us among those by His grace and mercy.  </div></body></html>
