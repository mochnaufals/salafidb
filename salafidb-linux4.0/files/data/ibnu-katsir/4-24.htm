Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, "We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah was revealed, e   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõÍúÕóäóÜÊõ ãöäó ÇáäøöÓóÂÁö ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ãóáóßúÊó ÃóíúãóÜäõßõãú</div><br>  (Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.'' This is the wording collected by At-Tirmidhi An-Nasa'i, Ibn Jarir and Muslim in his Sahih.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßöÊóÜÈó Çááøóåö Úóáóíúßõãú</div><br>  (Thus has Allah ordained for you) means, this prohibition was ordained for you by Allah.

A Mut`ah marriage is a marriage that ends upon a predeterminied date. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Leader of the Faithful `Ali bin Abi Talib said, "The Messenger of Allah prohibited Mut`ah marriage and eating the meat of domesticated donkeys on the day of Khaybar (battle).''  In addition, in his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Ar-Rabi` bin Sabrah bin Ma`bad Al-Juhani said that his father said that he accompanied the Messenger of Allah during the conquest of Makkah, and that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ Åöäøöí ßõäúÊõ ÃóĞöäúÊõ áóßõãú İöí ÇáÇÓúÊöãúÊóÇÚö ãöäó ÇáäøöÓóÇÁö¡ æóÅäøó Çááåó ŞóÏú ÍóÑøóãó Ğóáößó Åöáì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ İóãóäú ßóÇäó ÚöäóÏóåõ ãöäúåõäøó ÔóíúÁñ İóáúíõÎóáøö ÓóÈöíáóåõ¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÃúÎõĞõæÇ ãöãøóÇ ÂÊóíúÊõãõæåõäøó ÔíÆğÇ»</div><br>  (O people! I allowed you the Mut`ah marriage with women before. Now, Allah has prohibited it until the Day of Resurrection. Therefore, anyone who has any women in Mut`ah, let him let them go, and do not take anything from what you have given them.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÌõäóÇÍó Úóáóíúßõãú İöíãóÇ ÊóÑóÇÖóíúÊõãú Èöåö ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ÇáúİóÑöíÖóÉö</div><br>  (but if you agree mutually (to give more) after the requirement (has been determined), there is no sin on you.) is similar to His other statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊõæÇú ÇáäøöÓóÂÁó ÕóÏõŞóÜÊöåöäøó äöÍúáóÉğ</div><br>  (And give to the women their dowry with a good heart). The meaning of these Ayat is: If you have stipulated a dowry for her, and she later forfeits it, either totally or partially, then this bears no harm on you or her in this case. Ibn Jarir said, "Al-Hadrami said that some men would designate a certain dowry, but then fall into financial difficulties. Therefore, Allah said that there is no harm on you, O people, concerning your mutual agreement after the requirement (has been determined).'' meaning, if she gives up part of the dowry, then you men are allowed to accept that. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ßóÇäó ÚóáöíãÇğ ÍóßöíãÇğ</div><br>  (Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.) is suitable here, after Allah mentioned these prohibitions.  </div></body></html>
