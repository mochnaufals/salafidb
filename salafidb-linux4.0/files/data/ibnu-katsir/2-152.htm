The Messenger also takes them away from the darkness (of disbelief) to the light (of faith) and teaches them the Book, the Qur'an, and the Hikmah (i.e., the wisdom), which is his Sunnah. He also teaches them what they knew not. During the time of Jahiliyyah, they used to utter foolish statements. Later on, and with the blessing of the Prophet's Message and the goodness of his prophecy, they were elevated to the status of the Awliya' (loyal friends of Allah) and the rank of the scholars. Hence, they acquired the deepest knowledge among the people, the most pious hearts, and the most truthful tongues. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ãóäøó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄãöäöíäó ÅöĞú ÈóÚóËó İöíåöãú ÑóÓõæáÇğ ãøöäú ÃóäİõÓöåöãú íóÊúáõæÇú Úóáóíúåöãú ÁóÇíóÜÊöåö æóíõÒóßøöíåöãú</div><br>  (Indeed, Allah conferred a great favor on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger (Muhammad ) from among themselves, reciting unto them His verses (the Qur'an), and purifying them (from sins).) (3:164)  Allah also criticized those who did not give this bounty its due consideration, when He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑó Åöáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÈóÏøóáõæÇú äöÚúãóÊó Çááøóåö ßõİúÑğÇ æóÃóÍóáøõæÇú Şóæúãóåõãú ÏóÇÑó ÇáúÈóæóÇÑö </div><br>  (Have you not seen those who have changed the favors of Allah into disbelief (by denying Prophet Muhammad ) and his Message of Islam), and caused their people to dwell in the house of destruction) (14:28)  Ibn `Abbas commented, "Allah's favor means Muhammad.'' Therefore, Allah has commanded the believers to affirm this favor and to appreciate it by thanking and remembering Him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇĞúßõÑõæäöì ÃóĞúßõÑúßõãú æóÇÔúßõÑõæÇú áöí æóáÇó ÊóßúİõÑõæäö </div><br>  (Therefore, remember Me.

Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented about Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇĞúßõÑõæäöì ÃóĞúßõÑúßõãú</div><br>  (Therefore remember Me. I will remember you), "Remember Me regarding what I have commanded you and I will remember you regarding what I have compelled Myself to do for your benefit (i.e., His rewards and forgiveness).''  An authentic Hadith states:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì: ãóäú ĞóßóÑóäöí İöí äóİúÓöåö ĞóßóÑúÊõåõ İöí äóİúÓöí æóãóäú ĞóßóÑóäöí İöí ãóáóÃò ĞóßóÑúÊõåõ İöí ãóáóÃò ÎóíúÑò ãöäúå»</div><br>  (Allah the Exalted said, `Whoever mentions Me to himself, then I will mention him to Myself; and whoever mentions Me in a gathering, I will mention him in a better gathering.)'

If you draw closer to Me by a hand span, I will draw closer to you by forearm's length. If you draw closer to Me by a forearm's length, I will draw closer to you by an arm's length. And if you come to Me walking, I will come to you running).  Its chain is Sahih, it was recorded by Al-Bukhari.

In this Ayah, Allah commands that He be thanked and appreciated, and promises even more rewards for thanking Him.

Abu Raja' Al-`Utaridi said: `Imran bin Husayn came by us once wearing a nice silken garment that we never saw him wear before or afterwards. He said, "Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóäúÚóãó Çááåõ Úóáóíúåö äöÚúãóÉğ İóÅöäøó Çááåó íõÍöÈøõ Ãóäú íóÑóì ÃóËóÑó äöÚúãóÊöåö Úóáóì ÎóáúŞöå»</div><br>  ¡ æóŞóÇáó ÑóæúÍñ ãóÑøóÉğ:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Úóáóì ÚóÈúÏöå»</div><br>  (Those whom Allah has favored with a bounty, then Allah likes to see the effect of His bounty on His creation), or he said, "on His servant'' - according to Ruh (one of the narrators of the Hadith).  </div></body></html>
