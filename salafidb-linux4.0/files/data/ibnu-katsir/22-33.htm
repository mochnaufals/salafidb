This also includes obeying His commands in the best way when it comes to offering sacrifices, as Al-Hakam said narrating from Miqsam, from Ibn `Abbas: "Honoring them means choosing fat, healthy animals (for sacrifice).'' Abu Umamah bin Sahl said: "We used to fatten the Udhiyyah in Al-Madinah, and the Muslims used to fatten them.'' This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. In Sunan Ibn Majah, it was recorded from Abu Rafi` that the Messenger of Allah sacrificed two castrated, fat, horned rams. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded from Jabir: "The Messenger of Allah sacrificed two castrated, fat, horned rams.'' It was said, "The Messenger of Allah commanded us to examine their eyes and ears, and not to sacrifice the Muqabilah, the Mudabirah, the Sharqa, nor the Kharqa'.'' This was recorded by Ahmad and the Sunan compilers, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih. As for the Muqabilah, it is the one whose ear is cut at the front, Mudabirah is the one whose ear is cut at the back, the Shurqa is the one whose ear is split, as Ash-Shafi`i said. The Kharqa' is the one whose ear is pierced with a hole. And Allah knows best. It was recorded that Al-Bara' said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÑúÈóÚñ áóÇÊóÌõæÒõ İöí ÇáúÃóÖóÇÍöí: ÇáúÚóæúÑóÇÁõ ÇáúÈóíøöäõ ÚóæóÑõåóÇ¡ æóÇáúãóÑöíÖóÉõ ÇáúÈóíøöäõ ãóÑóÖõåóÇ¡ æóÇáúÚóÑúÌóÇÁõ ÇáúÈóíøöäõ ÙóáóÚõåóÇ¡ æóÇáúßóÓöíÑóÉõ ÇáøóÊöí áóÇÊõäúŞöí»</div><br>  (Four are not permitted for sacrifice: those that are obviously one-eyed, those that are obviously sick, those that are obviously lame and those that have broken bones, which no one would choose.)
