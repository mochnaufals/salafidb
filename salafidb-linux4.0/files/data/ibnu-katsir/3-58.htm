And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise. And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him before his death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he `Isa will be a witness against them.) 4:156-159  `His death' refers to `Isa, and the Ayah means that the People of the Book will believe in `Isa, before `Isa dies. This will occur when `Isa comes back to this world before the Day of Resurrection, as we will explain. By that time, all the People of the Book will believe in `Isa, for he will annul the Jizyah and he will only accept Islam from people. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-Hasan said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöí ãõÊóæóİøöíßó</div><br>  (I will take you) is in reference to sleep, for Allah raised `Isa while he was asleep. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Altering the Religion of `Isa</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãõØóåøöÑõßó ãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (And purify save you from those who disbelieve) by raising you to heaven,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÇÚöáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÊøóÈóÚõæßó İóæúŞó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö</div><br>  (And I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve, till the Day of Resurrection)  This is what happened. When Allah raised `Isa to heaven, his followers divided into sects and groups. Some of them believed in what Allah sent `Isa as, a servant of Allah, His Messenger, and the son of His female-servant.  However, some of them went to the extreme over `Isa, believing that he was the son of Allah. Some of them said that `Isa was Allah Himself, while others said that he was one of a Trinity. Allah mentioned these false creeds in the Qur'an and refuted them. The Christians remained like this until the third century CE, when a Greek king called, Constantine, became a Christian for the purpose of destroying Christianity. Constantine was either a philosopher, or he was just plain ignorant. Constantine changed the religion of `Isa by adding to it and deleting from it. He established the rituals of Christianity and the so-called Great Trust, which is in fact the Great Treachery. He also allowed them to eat the meat of swine, changed the direction of the prayer that `Isa established to the east, built churches for `Isa, and added ten days to the fast as compensation for a sin that he committed, as claimed. So the religion of `Isa became the religion of Constantine, who built more then twelve thousand churches, temples and monasteries for the Christians as well as the city that bears his name, Constantinople (Istanbul). Throughout this time, the Christians had the upper hand and dominated the Jews. Allah aided them against the Jews because they used to be closer to the truth than the Jews, even though both groups were and still are disbelievers, may Allah's curse descend on them.  When Allah sent Muhammad , those who believed in him also believed in Allah, His Angels, Books and Messengers in the correct manner. So they were the true followers of every Prophet who came to earth. They believed in the unlettered Prophet , the Final Messenger and the master of all mankind, who called them to believe in the truth in its entirety. This is why they had more right to every Prophet than his own nation, especially those who claim to follow their Prophet's way and religion, yet change and alter his religion. Furthermore, Allah abrogated all the laws that were sent down to the Prophets with the Law He sent Muhammad with, which consists of the true religion that shall never change or be altered until the commencement of the Last Hour. Muhammad's religion shall always be dominant and victorious over all other religions. This is why Allah allowed Muslims to conquer the eastern and western parts of the world and the kingdoms of the earth. Furthermore, all countries submitted to them; they demolished Kisra (king of Persia) and destroyed the Czar, ridding them of their treasures and spending these treasures for Allah's sake. All this occurred just as their Prophet told them it would, when he conveyed Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóÏó Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁÇãóäõæÇú ãöäúßõãú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÇÊö áóíóÓúÊóÎúáöİóäøóåõãú İöì ÇáÇúÑúÖö ßóãóÇ ÇÓúÊóÎúáóİó ÇáøóĞöíäó ãöä ŞóÈúáöåöãú æóáóíõãóßøäóäøó áóåõãú Ïöíäóåõãõ ÇáøóĞöì ÇÑúÊóÖóì áóåõãú æóáóíõÈóÏøáóäøóåõãú ãøä ÈóÚúÏö Îóæúİöåöãú ÃóãúäÇğ íóÚúÈõÏõæäóäöì áÇó íõÔúÑößõæäó Èöì ÔóíúÆÇğ</div><br>  (Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them. And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they worship Me and do not associate anything with Me.) 24:55.  Therefore, Muslims are the true believers in `Isa. The Muslims then acquired Ash-Sham from the Christians, causing them to evacuate to Asia Minor, to their fortified city in Constantinople. The Muslims will be above them until the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, he, Muhammad , who is truthful and who received the true news, has conveyed to Muslims that they will conquer Constantinople in the future, and seize its treasures. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Threatening the Disbelievers with Torment in This Life and the Hereafter</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ŞóÇáó Çááøóåõ íÚöíÓóì Åöäøöí ãõÊóæóİøöíßó æóÑóÇİöÚõßó Åöáóìøó æóãõØóåøöÑõßó ãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóÌóÇÚöáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÊøóÈóÚõæßó İóæúŞó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö Ëõãøó Åöáóíøó ãóÑúÌöÚõßõãú İóÃóÍúßõãõ Èóíúäóßõãú İöíãóÇ ßõäÊõãú İöíåö ÊóÎúÊóáöİõæäó - İóÃóãøóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú İóÃõÚóĞøöÈõåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈÇğ ÔóÏöíÏÇğ İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö æóãóÇ áóåõãú ãøöä äøóÜÕöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve till the Day of Resurrection.

This is what Allah did to the Jews who disbelieved in `Isa and the Christians who went to the extreme over him. Allah tormented them in this life; they were killed, captured, and lost their wealth and kingdoms. Their torment in the Hereafter is even worse and more severe,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ áóåõã ãøöäó Çááøóåö ãöä æóÇŞò</div><br>  (And they have no Waq (defender or protector) against Allah) 13:34.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇ æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÇÊö İóíõæóİøöíåöãú ÃõÌõæÑóåõãú</div><br>  (And as for those who believe and do righteous good deeds, Allah will pay them their reward in full) in this life, with victory and domination, and in the Hereafter, with Paradise and high grades,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ áÇó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (And Allah does not like the wrongdoers.)
