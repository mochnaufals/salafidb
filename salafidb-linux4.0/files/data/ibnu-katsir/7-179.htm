When Allah intended to create the creation, He knew what their work will be before they existed. He wrote all this in a Book, kept with Him, fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth. Muslim recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ŞóÏøóÑó ãóŞóÇÏöíÑó ÇáúÎóáúŞö ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú íóÎúáõŞó ÇáÓøóãóæóÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖó ÈöÎóãúÓöíäó Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉò æóßóÇäó ÚóÑúÔõåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÇÁ»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah decided the destination and due measurement of the creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth, and His Throne was over the water.) There are many Hadiths on this subject, and certainly, the matter of Al-Qadar is of utmost importance, yet this is not where we should discuss it. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõãú ŞõáõæÈñ áÇøó íóİúŞóåõæäó ÈöåóÇ æóáóåõãú ÃóÚúíõäñ áÇøó íõÈúÕöÑõæäó ÈöåóÇ æóáóåõãú ÁóÇĞóÇäñ áÇøó íóÓúãóÚõæäó ÈöåóÂ</div><br>  (They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not.) meaning, they do not benefit from these senses that Allah made for them as a means of gaining guidance. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ áóåõãú ÓóãúÚÇğ æóÃóÈúÕóÜÑÇğ æóÃóİúÆöÏóÉğ İóãóÂ ÃóÛúäóì Úóäúåõãú ÓóãúÚõåõãú æóáÇó ÃóÈúÕóÜÑõåõãú æóáÇó ÃóİúÆöÏóÊõåõãú ãøöä ÔóìúÁò ÅöĞú ßóÇäõæÇú íóÌúÍóÏõæäó ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And We had assigned them the (faculties of) hearing, seeing, and hearts; but their hearing, seeing, and their hearts availed them nothing since they used to deny the Ayat.) 46:26. Allah also said about the hypocrites,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Õõãøñ Èõßúãñ Úõãúìñ İóåõãú áÇó íóÑúÌöÚõæäó </div><br>  ((They are) deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not (to the right path)) 2:18, and about the disbelievers,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Õõãøñ Èõßúãñ Úõãúìñ İóåõãú áÇó íóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  ((They are) deaf, dumb and blind. So they do not understand.) 2:171 However, they are not deaf, dumb or blind, except relation to the guidance. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú Úóáöãó Çááøóåõ İöíåöãú ÎóíúÑğÇ áÃóÓúãóÚóåõãú æóáóæú ÃóÓúãóÚóåõãú áóÊóæóáøóæÇú æøóåõã ãøõÚúÑöÖõæäó </div><br>  (Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen; and even if He had made them listen, they would but have turned away with aversion (to the truth).) 8:23,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóåóÇ áÇó ÊóÚúãóì ÇáÇøñÈúÕóÜÑõ æóáóÜßöä ÊóÚúãóì ÇáúŞõáõæÈõ ÇáøóÊöì İöì ÇáÕøõÏõæÑö</div><br>  (Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.) 22:46, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÚúÔõ Úóä ĞößúÑö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö äõŞóíøöÖú áóåõ ÔóíúØóÇäÇğ İóåõæó áóåõ ŞóÑöíäñ - æóÅöäøóåõãú áóíóÕõÏøõæäóåõãú Úóäö ÇáÓøóÈöíáö æóíóÍúÓóÈõæäó Ãóäøóåõã ãøõåúÊóÏõæäó </div><br>  (And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious (Allah), We appoint for him Shaytan to be an intimate companion to him. And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright!)43:36-37 Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ßóÇáÃóäúÚóÜãö</div><br>  (They are like cattle), means, those who neither hear the truth, nor understand it, nor see the guidance, are just like grazing cattle that do not benefit from these senses, except for what sustains their life in this world. Allah said in a similar Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóËóáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ßóãóËóáö ÇáøóĞöì íóäúÚöŞõ ÈöãóÇ áÇó íóÓúãóÚõ ÅöáÇøó ÏõÚóÂÁğ æóäöÏóÂÁğ</div><br>  (And the example of those who disbelieve is as that of one who shouts to those who hear nothing but calls and cries.) 2:171 meaning, their example, when they are called to the faith, is the example of cattle that hear only the voice of their shepherd, but cannot understand what he is saying. Allah further described them   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú åõãú ÃóÖóáøõ</div><br>  (nay even more astray), than cattle, because cattle still respond to the call of their shepherd, even though they do not understand what he is saying. As for the people described here, they are unlike cattle, which fulfill the purpose and service they were created for. The disbeliever was created to worship Allah alone in Tawhid, but he disbelieved in Allah and associated others in His worship. Therefore, those people who obey Allah are more honorable than some angels, while cattle are better than those who disbelieve in Him. So Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ßóÇáÃóäúÚóÜãö Èóáú åõãú ÃóÖóáøõ ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÛóÜİöáõæäó</div><br>  (They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones.)  </div></body></html>
