He is the One Who does whatsoever He wills and wants and chooses.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ãõÚóŞøöÈó áöÍõßúãöåö æóåõæó ÓóÑöíÚõ ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈö</div><br>  (There is none to put back His judgement and He is swift at reckoning.) 13:41   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóäóÇú áóßõãú äóĞöíÑñ ãøõÈöíäñİóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö</div><br>  (I am (sent) to you only as a plain warner.
