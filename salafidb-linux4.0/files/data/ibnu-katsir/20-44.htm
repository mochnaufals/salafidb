He worked as a shepherd for his father-in-law until the appointed time for his work ended. Then he met the decree of Allah and His predetermined will, without him having any set appointment. This entire situation was under the control of Allah, Blessed be He, the Most High. He compels His servants and His creatures to whatever end He wills. This is why Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÌöÆúÊó Úóáóì ŞóÏóÑò íãõæÓóì</div><br>  (Then You came here according to the fixed term which I ordained (for you), O Musa!) Mujahid said, "For a set appointment.'' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar reported from Qatadah that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÌöÆúÊó Úóáóì ŞóÏóÑò íãõæÓóì</div><br>  (Then You came here according to the fixed term which I ordained (for you), O Musa!) "For the decree of messengership and prophethood.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÕúØóäóÚúÊõßó áöäóİúÓöì </div><br>  (And I have chosen you for Myself.) This means, "I have chosen you and selected you to be a Messenger for Myself. This is as I wish and according to My will.'' Concerning the Tafsir of this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÊóŞóì ÂÏóãõ æóãõæÓóì İóŞóÇáó ãõæÓóì: ÃóäúÊó ÇáøóĞöí ÃóÔúŞóíúÊó ÇáäøóÇÓó æóÃóÎúÑóÌúÊóåõãú ãöäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ İóŞóÇáó ÂÏóãõ: æóÃóäúÊó ÇáøóĞöí ÇÕúØóİóÇßó Çááåõ ÈöÑöÓóÇáóÊöåö æóÇÕúØóİóÇßó áöäóİúÓöåö¡ æóÃóäúÒóáó Úóáóíúßó ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉó¿ ŞóÇáó: äóÚóãú¡ ŞóÇáó: İóæóÌóÏúÊóåõ ãóßúÊõæÈğÇ Úóáóíøó ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú íóÎúáõŞóäöí¿ ŞóÇáó: äóÚóãú¡ İóÍóÌøó ÂÏóãõ ãõæÓóì»</div><br>  (Adam and Musa met, and Musa said, "You are the one who made things difficult for mankind and you caused them to be evicted from Paradise.'' Adam said, "Are you the one whom Allah chose for His Message, and He selected you for Himself and He revealed the Tawrah to you'' Musa replied, "Yes.'' Then Adam said, "Did you find that it was preordained upon me before He (Allah) created me'' Musa replied, "Yes.'' Therefore, Adam defeated Musa's argument.) Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this narration. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇĞúåóÈú ÃóäÊó æóÃóÎõæßó ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊöì</div><br>  (Go you and your brother with My Ayat,) This means with My proofs, evidences and miracles.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóäöíóÇ İöì ĞößúÑöì</div><br>  (And do not, you both, slacken and become weak in My remembrance.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah related from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "This means do not be slow.'' Mujahid reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "This means do not be weak.'' The meaning here is that they should not slacken in the remembrance of Allah. Rather, they both should remember Allah during their meeting with Fir`awn so that the remembrance of Allah can be an aid for them against him. The remembrance of Allah would be their strength and their power that would defeat him. Allah's statement;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇĞúåóÈóÂ Åöáóì İöÑúÚóæúäó Åöäøóåõ ØóÛóì </div><br>  (Go both of you to Fir`awn, Verily, he has transgressed.) means that he has rebelled and become haughty and insolent against Allah and he has disobeyed Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞõæáÇó áóåõ ŞóæúáÇğ áøóíøöäÇğ áøóÚóáøóåõ íóÊóĞóßøóÑõ Ãóæú íóÎúÔóì </div><br>  (And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allah).) This Ayah contains a great lesson. Even though Fir`awn was the most insolent and arrogant of people and Musa was the friend of Allah among His creation at that time, Musa was still commanded to speak to Fir`awn with mildness and softness. Therefore, their invitation to him was with gentle, soft and easy speech that is used by one who is a close friend. This is so that the message may have more effect on the souls, and so it would have deeper and more beneficial results. This is as Allah, the Exalted, says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúÚõ Åöáöì ÓóÈöíáö ÑóÈøößó ÈöÇáúÍößúãóÉö æóÇáúãóæúÚöÙóÉö ÇáúÍóÓóäóÉö æóÌóÜÏöáúåõã ÈöÇáøóÊöì åöìó ÃóÍúÓóäõ</div><br>  (Invite (mankind) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.) 16:125 Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóÚóáøóåõ íóÊóĞóßøóÑõ Ãóæú íóÎúÔóì</div><br>  (perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allah). ) This means that perhaps he will recant from that which he is in of misguidance and destruction,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú íóÎúÔóì</div><br>  (or he will fear) meaning that he will become obedient due to fear of Allah. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöãóäú ÃóÑóÇÏó Ãóä íóĞøóßøóÑó Ãóæú ÃóÑóÇÏó ÔõßõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (For such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.) 25:62 Thus, to remember means to recant from that which is dangerous, and fear means to attain obedience.  </div></body></html>
