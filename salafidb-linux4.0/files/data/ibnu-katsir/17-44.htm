In everything there is a sign of Allah indicating that He is One.

This applies to all creatures generally, animal, inanimate and botanical. This is the better known of the two opinions according to the most reliable of two opinions. It was reported in Sahih Al-Bukhari that Ibn Mas`ud said: "We used to hear the Tasbih of the food as it was being eaten. '' Imam Ahmad recorded that Mu`adh bin Anas said that the Messenger of Allah came upon some people who were sitting on their mounts and talking to one another. He said to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÑúßóÈõæåóÇ ÓóÇáöãóÉğ æóÏóÚõæåóÇ ÓóÇáöãóÉğ¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæåóÇ ßóÑóÇÓöíøó áöÃóÍóÇÏöíËößõãú İöí ÇáØøõÑõŞö æóÇáúÃóÓúæóÇŞö¡ İóÑõÈøó ãóÑúßõæÈóÉò ÎóíúÑñ ãöäú ÑóÇßöÈöåóÇ¡ æóÃóßúËóÑõ ĞößúÑğÇÇöááåö ãöäúå»</div><br>  (Ride them safely then leave them safely. Do not use them as chairs for you to have conversations in the streets and marketplaces, because the one that is ridden may be better than the one who rides it, and may remember Allah more than he does.) An-Nasa'i recorded in his Sunan that `Abdullah bin `Amr said: "The Messenger of Allah forbade us from killing frogs.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÍóáöíãğÇ ÛóİõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.) means, He does not hasten to punish those who disobey Him, rather He gives them time and waits, then if they persist in their stubborn Kufr, He seizes them with a punishment of the All-Mighty, All-Capable. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó áóíõãúáöí áöáÙøóÇáöãö ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÎóĞóåõ áóãú íõİúáöÊúå»</div><br>  (Allah will let the wrongdoer carry on until, when He does seize him, He will never let him go.)
