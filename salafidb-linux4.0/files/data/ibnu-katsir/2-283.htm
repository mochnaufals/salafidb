And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then let there be a pledge taken (mortgaging), then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust, and let him have Taqwa of Allah, his Lord.

Ibn `Abbas said, "And even if they find a scribe, but did not find paper, ink or pen.'' Then,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÑöåóÜäñ ãøóŞúÈõæÖóÉñ</div><br>  (let there be a pledge taken (mortgaging)) given to the creditor in lieu of writing the transaction. The Two Sahihs recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah died while his shield was mortgaged with a Jew in return for thirty Wasq (approximately 180 kg) of barley, which the Prophet bought on credit as provisions for his household. In another narration, the Hadith stated that this Jew was among the Jews of Al-Madinah.  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäú Ãóãöäó ÈóÚúÖõßõã ÈóÚúÖğÇ İóáúíõÄóÏøö ÇáøóĞöì ÇÄúÊõãöäó ÃóãóÜäóÊóåõ</div><br>  (then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully).)  Ibn Abi Hatim recorded, with a sound chain of narration, that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, "This Ayah abrogated what came before it (i.e. that which required recording the transaction and having witnesses present).'' Ash-Sha`bi said, "If you trust each other, then there is no harm if you do not write the loan or have witnesses present.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáúíóÊøóŞö Çááøóåó ÑóÈøóåõ</div><br>  (And let him have Taqwa of Allah) means, the debtor.  Imam Ahmad and the Sunan recorded that Qatadah said that Al-Hasan said that Samurah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Úóáóì ÇáúíóÏö ãóÇ ÃóÎóĞóÊú¡ ÍóÊøóì ÊõÄóÏøöíóå»</div><br>  (The hand (of the debtor) will carry the burden of what it took until it gives it back.)  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóßúÊõãõæÇú ÇáÔøóåóÜÏóÉó</div><br>  (And conceal not the evidence) means, do not hide it or refuse to announce it. Ibn `Abbas and other scholars said, "False testimony is one of the worst of the major sins, and such is the case with hiding the true testimony. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóßúÊõãúåóÇ İóÅöäøóåõ ÁóÇËöãñ ŞóáúÈõåõ</div><br>  (For he who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful).  As-Suddi commented, "Meaning he is a sinner in his heart.''  This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó äóßúÊõãõ ÔóåóÜÏóÉó Çááøóåö ÅöäøóÂ ÅöĞóÇğ áøóãöäó ÇáÇøñËöãöíäó</div><br>  (We shall not hide testimony of Allah, for then indeed we should be of the sinful) 5:106.
