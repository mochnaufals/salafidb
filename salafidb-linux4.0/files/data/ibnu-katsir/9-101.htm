The Messenger knew that some of those who associated with him from the people of Al-Madinah were hypocrites, and he used to see them day and night but did not know who they were exactly. We mentioned before in the explanation of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóãøõæÇú ÈöãóÇ áóãú íóäóÇáõæÇú</div><br>  (...and they resolved that (plot) which they were unable to carry out...)9:74 that the Prophet informed Hudhayfah of the names of fourteen or fifteen hypocrites. This knowledge is specific in this case, not that the Messenger of Allah was informed of all their names, and Allah knows best. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma`mar said that Qatadah commented on this Ayah 9:101, "What is the matter with some people who claim to have knowledge about other people, saying, `So-and-so is in Paradise and so-and-so is in the Fire.' If you ask any of these people about himself, he would say, `I do not know (if I will end up in Paradise or the Fire)!' Verily, you have more knowledge of yourself than other people. You have assumed a job that even the Prophets before you refrained from assuming.

And I am not a guardian over you)11:86, while Allah said to His Prophet ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊóÚúáóãõåõãú äóÍúäõ äóÚúáóãõåõãú</div><br>  (you know them not, We know them.)'' Mujahid said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóäõÚóĞøöÈõåõã ãøóÑøóÊóíúäö</div><br>  (We shall punish them twice), "By killing and capture.''
