This was Adam, peace be upon him, whom Allah created from sounding clay of altered black smooth mud. Ibn Jarir said, "Adam was called Tin because he was created from it.'' Qatadah said, "Adam was created from Tin.'' This is the more apparent meaning and is closer to the context, for Adam, upon him be peace, was created from a sticky Tin, which is a sounding clay of altered black smooth mud, and that is created from dust, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäú ÁóÇíóÜÊöåö Ãóäú ÎóáóŞóßõãú ãøöä ÊõÑóÇÈò Ëõãøó ÅöĞóÂ ÃóäÊõãú ÈóÔóÑñ ÊóäÊóÔöÑõæäó </div><br>  (And among His signs is this that He created you (Adam) from dust, and then -- behold you are human beings scattered!) 30:20 Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Musa that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÎóáóŞó ÂÏóãó ãöäú ŞóÈúÖóÉò ŞóÈóÖóåóÇ ãöäú ÌóãöíÚö ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ İóÌóÇÁó Èóäõæ ÂÏóãó Úóáóì ŞóÏúÑö ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ ÌóÇÁó ãöäúåõãõ ÇáúÃóÍúãóÑõ æóÇáúÃóÈúíóÖõ æóÇáúÃóÓúæóÏõ æóÈóíúäó Ğáößó¡ æóÇáúÎóÈöíËõ æóÇáØøóíøöÈõ æóÈóíúäó Ğáöß»</div><br>  (Allah created Adam from a handful which He picked up from throughout the earth, so the sons of Adam came forth accordingly, red and white and black and in between, evil and good and in between.) Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi recorded something similar. At-Tirmidhi said, "It is Sahih Hasan.
