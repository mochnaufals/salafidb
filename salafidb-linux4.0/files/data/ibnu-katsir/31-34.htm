Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.

The Knower of the Unseen is Allah These are the keys of the Unseen, whose knowledge Allah alone has kept for Himself, and no one else knows them unless Allah tells him about them.

Similarly, no one but Allah knows when rain will fall, but when He issues the commands, the angels who are entrusted with the task of bringing rain know about it, as do those among His creation whom He wills should know. No one but He knows what is in the wombs of what He wants to create, but when He decrees whether it is to be male or female, and whether it is to be blessed or doomed, the angels who are entrusted with that know about it, as do those among His creation whom He wills should know. No one knows what he will earn tomorrow with regard to this world or the Hereafter.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊóÏúÑöì äóİúÓñ ÈöÃóìøö ÃóÑúÖò ÊóãõæÊõ</div><br>  (and no person knows in what land he will die.) in his own land or elsewhere, in some other land.

(6:59) It was reported in the Sunnah that the above five things are called the Keys of the Unseen.

The chain of narrators for this Hadith is Sahih, although they did not recorded it. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Hadith of Ibn `Umar</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóİóÇÊöíÍõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö ÎóãúÓñ áóÇ íóÚúáóãõåõäøó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÚöäÏóåõ Úöáúãõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö æóíõäóÒøöáõ ÇáúÛóíúËó æóíóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÍóÇãö æóãóÇ ÊóÏúÑöì äóİúÓñ ãøóÇĞóÇ ÊóßúÓöÈõ ÛóÏÇğ æóãóÇ ÊóÏúÑöì äóİúÓñ ÈöÃóìøö ÃóÑúÖò ÊóãõæÊõ Åöäøó Çááøóåó Úóáóíãñ ÎóÈöíÑñ »</div><br>  (The Keys of the Unseen are five, which no one knows except Allah: (Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.

This was recorded only by Al-Bukhari, which he narrated in the Book of the Rain Prayer in his Sahih. He also recorded it in his Tafsir with a different chain of narrators, stating that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, "The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóİóÇÊöíÍõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö ÎóãúÓ»</div><br>  (The Keys of the Unseen are five.)''

The timing of the Hour is one of the five things which no one knows except Allah: (Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs....)) Then the man went away, and the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑõÏøõæåõ Úóáóí»</div><br>  (Bring him back to me.) They went to bring him back, but they could not find him.

It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari in the Book of Faith, and by Muslim with several chains of narration. We have discussed this at the beginning of our commentary on Al-Bukhari, where we mentioned at length some Hadiths narrated by the Commander of the faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab.

It says in the Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÑóÇÏó Çááåõ ŞóÈúÖó ÚóÈúÏò ÈöÃóÑúÖò ÌóÚóáó áóåõ ÅöáóíúåóÇ ÍóÇÌóÉ»</div><br>  (If Allah wants to take a person's soul in a particular land, He will give him a reason to go there.) In Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir, Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Usamah bin Zayd said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÌóÚóáó Çááåõ ãöíÊóÉó ÚóÈúÏò ÈöÃóÑúÖò ÅöáøóÇ ÌóÚóáó áóåõ İöíåóÇ ÍóÇÌóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah does not will that a person should die in a certain land but He gives him a reason to go there.)'' This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Luqman. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Sufficient for us is Allah and He is the Best Disposer of affairs.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
