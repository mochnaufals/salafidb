Verily, We took the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent Messengers to them. Whenever there came to them a Messenger with what they themselves desired not, a group of them they called liars, and others among them they killed.) (71. They thought there will be no Fitnah (trial or punishment), so they became blind and deaf; after that Allah turned to them (with forgiveness); yet again many of them became blind and deaf. And Allah is the All-Seer of what they do.) Allah reminds that He took the covenant and pledges from the Children of Israel to hear and obey Him and His Messenger. They broke these pledges and covenants and followed their lusts and desires instead of the law, and whichever part of the law they agreed with, they took it. Otherwise, they abandoned it, if it did not conform to their desires. This is why Allah said,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøóãóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõãú ÑóÓõæáñ ÈöãóÇ áÇó Êóåúæóì ÃóäİõÓõåõãú İóÑöíŞÇğ ßóĞøóÈõæÇú æóİóÑöíŞÇğ íóŞúÊõáõæäóæóÍóÓöÈõæÇú ÃóáÇøó Êóßõæäó İöÊúäóÉñ İóÚóãõæÇú æóÕóãøõæÇú</div><br>  (Whenever there came to them a Messenger with what they themselves desired not - a group of them they called liars, and others among them they killed.

Consequently, they were blinded from the truth and became deaf, incapable of hearing the truth. For these reasons they were unable to be guided by it. Allah forgave that, then,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÕóãøõæÇú Ëõãøó</div><br>  (yet they became blind and deaf) again,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóËöíÑñ ãøöäúåõãú æóÇááøóåõ ÈóÕöíÑñ ÈöãóÇ íóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (many of them, and Allah is the All-Seer of what they do.)
