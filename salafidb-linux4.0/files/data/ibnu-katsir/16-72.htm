And Allah has made for you mates of your own kind, and has made for you, from your mates, sons and grandsons, and has granted you good provisions. Do they then believe in false deities and deny favor of Allah)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Among His Blessings and Signs are Mates, Children and Grandchildren</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah mentions the blessing He has bestowed upon His servant by giving them mates from among themselves, mates of their own kind. If He had given them mates of another kind, there would be no harmony, love and mercy between them. But out of His mercy He has made the Children of Adam male and female, and has made the females wives or mates for the males. Then Allah mentions that from these wives He creates children and grandchildren, one's children's children. This was the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd. Shu`bah said, narrating from Abu Bishr from Sa`id bin Jubayr from Ibn `Abbas: "Children and grandchildren, who are one's children and one's children's children.'' It was also said that this means servants and helpers, or it means sons-in-law or in-laws. I say: if we understand   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍóİóÏóÉğ</div><br>  (grandsons) to refer back to wives, then it must mean children, children's children, and sons-in-law, because they are the husbands of one's daughter or the children of one's wife.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÒóŞóßõã ãøöäó ÇáØøóíøöÈóÇÊö</div><br>  (and has granted you good provisions.) meaning your food and drink. Then Allah denounces those who associate others in worship with the One Who bestows blessings on them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÈöÇáúÈóÜØöáö íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (Do they then believe in false deities), meaning idols and rivals to Allah   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈöäöÚúãóÊö Çááøóåö åõãú íóßúİõÑõæäó</div><br>  (and deny the favor of Allah) meaning, by concealing the blessings that Allah has given them and attributing them to others. According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó íóŞõæáõ áöáúÚóÈúÏö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ãõãúÊóäøğÇ Úóáóíúåö: Ãóáóãú ÃõÒóæøöÌúßó¿ Ãóáóãú ÃõßúÑöãúßó¿ Ãóáóãú ÃõÓóÎøöÑú áóßó ÇáúÎóíúáó æóÇáúÅöÈöáó¡ æóÃóĞóÑúßó ÊóÑúÃóÓõ æóÊóÑúÈóÚõ¿»</div><br>  (Allah will say to His servant on the Day of Resurrection, reminding him of His blessings: "Did I not give you a wife Did I not honor you Did I not subject horses and camels to your use, and cause you to occupy a position of leadership and honor'')  </div></body></html>
