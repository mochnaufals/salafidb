And those who, when they have committed Fahishah (immoral sin) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; and none can forgive sins but Allah, and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.) (136. For such, the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath (Paradise), wherein they shall abide forever.

For instance, when the time to pay a loan comes, the creditor would say to the debtor, "Either pay now, or the loan will incur interest.'' If the debtor asks for deferment of the loan, the creditor would require interest and this would occur year after year until the little capital becomes multiplied many times. Allah also commands His servants to have Taqwa of Him so that they may achieve success in this life and the Hereafter. Allah also threatens them with the Fire and warns them against it, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú ÇáäøóÇÑó ÇáøóÊöì ÃõÚöÏøóÊú áöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó - æóÃóØöíÚõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇáÑøóÓõæáó áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊõÑúÍóãõæäó </div><br>  (And fear the Fire, which is prepared for the disbelievers.

Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÇÑöÚõæÇú Åöáóì ãóÛúİöÑóÉò ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú æóÌóäøóÉò ÚóÑúÖõåóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊõ æóÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ÃõÚöÏøóÊú áöáúãõÊøóŞöíäó </div><br>  (And march forth in the way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the Muttaqin (the pious)) 3:133.  Just as the Fire was prepared for the disbelievers. It was reported that the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÑúÖõåóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊõ æóÇáÇøñÑúÖõ</div><br>  (as wide as the heavens and the earth) draws the attention to the spaciousness of Paradise. For instance, Allah said in another Ayah, while describing the couches of Paradise,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóØóÂÆöäõåóÇ ãöäú ÅöÓúÊóÈúÑóŞò</div><br>  (lined with silk brocade) 55:54, so what about their outer covering It was also said that Paradise is as wide as its length, because it is a dome under the Throne. The width and length of a dome or a circle are the same in distance. This is supported by what is found in the Sahih;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÓóÃóáúÊõãõ Çááåó ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉó İóÇÓúÃóáõæåõ ÇáúİöÑúÏóæúÓó¡ İóÅöäøóåõ ÃóÚúáóì ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉö¡ æóÃóæúÓóØõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóãöäúåõ ÊóİóÌøóÑõ ÃóäúåóÇÑõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóÓóŞúİõåóÇ ÚóÑúÔõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóä»</div><br>  (When you ask Allah for Paradise, ask Him for Al-Firdaws which is the highest and best part of Paradise. From it originate the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the Throne of the Most Beneficent (Allah).)  This Ayah 3:133 above is similar to Allah's statement in Surat Al-Hadid,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÇÈöŞõæÇú Åöáóì ãóÛúİöÑóÉò ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú æóÌóäøóÉò ÚóÑúÖõåóÇ ßóÚóÑúÖö ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord (Allah), and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the Earth) 57:21.  Al-Bazzar recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that a man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him, about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóäøóÉò ÚóÑúÖõåóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊõ æóÇáÇøñÑúÖõ</div><br>  (Paradise as wide as the heavens and the Earth) 3:133; "Where is the Fire then'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÑóÃóíúÊó Çááøóíúáó ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÇÁó áóÈöÓó ßõáøó ÔóíúÁò¡ İóÃóíúäó ÇáäøóåóÇÑõ¿»</div><br>  (When the night comes, it overtakes everything, so where is the day) The man said, "Where Allah wants it to be.'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóßóĞáößó ÇáäøóÇÑõ Êóßõæäõ ÍóíúËõ ÔóÇÁó Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóá»</div><br>  (Similarly, the Fire is where Allah wants it to be.) This Hadith has two possible meanings. First, when we do not see the night during the day, this does not mean that the day is not somewhere else, even though we cannot see it. Such is the case with Hell-fire, for it is where Allah wants it to be. The second meaning is that when the day overcomes this part of the world, the night overtakes the other part. Such is the case with Paradise, for it is in the utmost heights above the heavens and under the Throne. The width of Paradise is, as Allah stated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÚóÑúÖö ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (whereof is as the width of the heaven and the Earth) 57:21.  The Fire, on the other hand, is in the lowest of lows. Therefore, Paradise being as wide as the heavens and Earth does not contradict the fact that the Fire exists wherever Allah wills it to be.  Allah said, while describing the people of Paradise,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íõäİöŞõæäó İöì ÇáÓøóÑøóÂÁö æóÇáÖøóÑøóÂÁö</div><br>  (Those who spend (in Allah's cause) in prosperity and in adversity) 3:134, in hard times and easy times, while active (or enthusiastic) and otherwise, healthy or ill, and in all conditions, just as Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íõäİöŞõæäó Ãóãúæóáóåõãú ÈöÇáøóíúáö æóÇáäøóåóÇÑö ÓöÑøğÇ æóÚóáÇóäöíóÉğ</div><br>  (Those who spend their wealth (in Allah's cause) by night and day, in secret and in public) 2:274 These believers are never distracted from obeying Allah, spending on what pleases Him, being kind to His servants and their relatives, and other acts of righteousness. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúßóÜÙöãöíäó ÇáúÛóíúÙó æóÇáúÚóÜİöíäó Úóäö ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (who repress anger, and who pardon men;) 3:134 for when they are angry, they control their anger and do act upon it. Rather, they even forgive those who hurt them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóíúÓó ÇáÔøóÏöíÏõ ÈöÇáÕøõÑóÚóÉö¡ æóáßöäøó ÇáÔøóÏöíÏó ÇáøóĞöí íóãúáößõ äóİúÓóåõ ÚöäúÏó ÇáúÛóÖóÈ»</div><br>  (The strong person is not he who is able to physically overcome people. The strong person is he who overcomes his rage when he is angry.)  This Hadith is also recorded in the Two Sahihs. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóäúÙóÑó ãõÚúÓöÑğÇ Ãóæú æóÖóÚó áóåõ¡ æóŞóÇåõ Çááåõ ãöäú İóíúÍö Ìóåóäøóãó¡ ÃóáóÇ Åöäøó Úóãóáó ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉö ÍóÒúäñ ÈöÑóÈúæóÉò ËóáóÇËğÇ ÃóáóÇ Åöäøó Úóãóáó ÇáäøóÇÑö Óóåúáñ ÈöÓóåúæóÉò. æóÇáÓøóÚöíÏõ ãóäú æõŞöíó ÇáúİöÊóäó¡ æóãóÇ ãöäú ÌóÑúÚóÉò ÃóÍóÈøõ Åöáóì Çááåö ãöäú ÌóÑúÚóÉö ÛóíúÙò íóßúÙöãõåóÇ ÚóÈúÏñ¡ ãóÇ ßóÙóãóåóÇ ÚóÈúÏñ ááåö ÅöáøóÇ ãóáóÃó Ìóæúİóåõ ÅöíãóÇäğÇ»</div><br>  (He who gives time to a debtor or forgives him, then Allah will save him from the heat of Jahannam (Hell-fire). Behold! The deeds of Paradise are difficult to reach, for they are on top of a hill, while the deeds of the Fire are easy to find in the lowlands. The happy person is he who is saved from the tests. Verily, there is no dose of anything better to Allah than a dose of rage that the servant controls, and whenever the servant of Allah controls it, he will be internally filled with faith.)  This Hadith was recorded by Imam Ahmad, its chain of narration is good, it does not contain any disparraged narrators, and the meaning is good.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Sahl bin Mu`adh bin Anas said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ßóÙóãó ÛóíúÙğÇ æóåõæó ŞóÇÏöÑñ Úóáì Ãóäú íõäúİöĞóåõ ÏóÚóÇåõ Çááåõ Úóáì ÑõÄõæÓö ÇáúÎóáóÇÆöŞö ÍóÊøóì íõÎóíøöÑóåõ ãöäú Ãóíøö ÇáúÍõæÑö ÔóÇÁ»</div><br>  (Whoever controlled rage while able to act upon it, then Allah will call him while all creation is a witness, until He gives him the choice of any of the Huris (fair females with wide, lovely eyes - as mates for the pious) he wishes.)  Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi said was "Hasan Gharib''.  Ibn Marduwyah recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÊóÌóÑøóÚó ÚóÈúÏñ ãöäú ÌóÑúÚóÉò ÃóİúÖóáó ÃóÌúÑğÇ ãöäú ÌóÑúÚóÉö ÛóíúÙò ßóÙóãóåóÇ ÇÈúÊöÛóÇÁó æóÌúåö Çááå»</div><br>  (There is not a dose of anything that the servant takes which is better than a dose of control of rage that he feels, when he does it seeking Allah's Face.) Ibn Jarir and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith.  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúßóÜÙöãöíäó ÇáúÛóíúÙó</div><br>  (who repress anger) meaning, they do not satisfy their rage upon people. Rather, they refrain from harming them and await their rewards with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÚóÜİöíäó Úóäö ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (and who pardon men;) They forgive those who treat them with injustice. Therefore, they do not hold any ill feelings about anyone in their hearts, and this is the most excellent conduct in this regard. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúãõÍúÓöäöíäó</div><br>  (verily, Allah loves the Muhsinin (the good-doers)).  This good conduct is a type of Ihsan excellence in the religion. There is a Hadith that reads,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ËóáóÇËñ ÃõŞúÓöãõ Úóáóíúåöäøó: ãóÇ äóŞóÕó ãóÇáñ ãöäú ÕóÏóŞóÉò¡ æóãóÇ ÒóÇÏó Çááåõ ÚóÈúÏğÇ ÈöÚóİúæò ÅöáøóÇ ÚöÒøğÇ¡ æóãóäú ÊóæóÇÖóÚó ááåö ÑóİóÚóåõ Çááå»</div><br>  (I swear regarding three matters: no charity shall ever decrease the wealth; whenever one forgives people, then Allah will magnify his honor; and he who is humble for Allah, then Allah will raise his rank.)  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÇ İóÚóáõæÇú İóÜÍöÔóÉğ Ãóæú ÙóáóãõæÇú ÃóäúİõÓóåõãú ĞóßóÑõæÇú Çááøóåó İóÇÓúÊóÛúİóÑõæÇú áöĞõäõæÈöåöãú</div><br>  (And those who, when they have committed Fahishah or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins) 3:135.  Therefore, if they commit an error they follow it with repentance and ask forgiveness.

A similar narration was collected in the Sahih.  `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Anas bin Malik said, "I was told that when the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÇ İóÚóáõæÇú İóÜÍöÔóÉğ Ãóæú ÙóáóãõæÇú ÃóäúİõÓóåõãú ĞóßóÑõæÇú Çááøóåó İóÇÓúÊóÛúİóÑõæÇú áöĞõäõæÈöåöãú</div><br>  (And those who, when they have committed Fahishah or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins,) was revealed, Iblis (Shayatan) cried.''
