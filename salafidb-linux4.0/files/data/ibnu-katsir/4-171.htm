O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allah except the truth.

The Christians exaggerated over `Isa until they elevated him above the grade that Allah gave him. They elevated him from the rank of prophethood to being a god, whom they worshipped just as they worshipped Allah. They exaggerated even more in the case of those who they claim were his followers, claiming that they were inspired, thus following every word they uttered whether true or false, be it guidance or misguidance, truth or lies. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÊøóÎóĞõæÇú ÃóÍúÈóÜÑóåõãú æóÑõåúÈóÜäóåõãú ÃóÑúÈóÇÈÇğ ãøöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (They took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah.)  Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊõØúÑõæäöí ßóãóÇ ÃóØúÑóÊö ÇáäøóÕóÇÑóìö ÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäó ãóÑúíóãó.

Verily, I am only a servant, so say, `Allah's servant and His Messenger.') This is the wording of Al-Bukhari. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that a man once said, "O Muhammad! You are our master and the son of our master, our most righteous person and the son of our most righteous person...'' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ Úóáóíúßõãú ÈöŞóæúáößõãú¡ æóáóÇ íóÓúÊóåúæöíóäøóßõãõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäõ¡ÃóäóÇ ãõÍóãøóÏõ Èúäõ ÚóÈúÏöÇááåö¡ ÚóÈúÏõÇááåö æóÑóÓõæáõåõ¡ æóÇááåö ãóÇ ÃõÍöÈøõ Ãóäú ÊóÑúİóÚõæäöí İóæúŞó ãóäúÒöáóÊöí ÇáøóÊöí ÃóäúÒóáóäöí Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóá»</div><br>  (O people!

Allah is glorified, praised, and honored in His might, grandure and greatness, and there is no deity worthy of worship nor Lord but Him. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáúãóÓöíÍõ ÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäõ ãóÑúíóãó ÑóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö æóßóáöãóÊõåõ ÃóáúŞóÜåóÇ Åöáóì ãóÑúíóãó æóÑõæÍñ ãøöäúåõ</div><br>  (Al-Masih `Isa, son of Maryam, was (no more than) a Messenger of Allah and His Word, which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit from created by Him;) `Isa is only one of Allah's servants and one of His creatures. Allah said to him, `Be', and he was, and He sent him as a Messenger. `Isa was a word from Allah that He bestowed on Maryam, meaning He created him with the word `Be' that He sent with Jibril to Maryam. Jibril blew the life of `Isa into Maryam by Allah's leave, and `Isa came to existence as a result. This incident was in place of the normal conception between man and woman that results in children. This is why `Isa was a word and a Ruh (spirit) created by Allah, as he had no father to conceive him. Rather, he came to existence through the word that Allah uttered, `Be,' and he was, through the life that Allah sent with Jibril.

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ahmad bin Sinan Al-Wasiti said that he heard Shadh bin Yahya saying about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóáöãóÊõåõ ÃóáúŞóÜåóÇ Åöáóì ãóÑúíóãó æóÑõæÍñ ãøöäúåõ</div><br>  (and His Word, which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit from created by Him;) "`Isa was not the word.

Al-Bukhari recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÔóåöÏó Ãóäú áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ¡ æóÍúÏóåõ áóÇ ÔóÑöíßó áóåõ¡ æóÃóäøó ãõÍóãøóÏğÇ ÚóÈúÏõåõ æóÑóÓõæáõåõ¡ æóÃóäøó ÚöíÓóì ÚóÈúÏõÇááåö æóÑóÓõæáõåõ æóßóáöãóÊõåõ ÃóáúŞóÇåóÇ Åöáì ãóÑúíóãó æóÑõæÍñ ãöäúåõ¡ æóÃóäøó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ÍóŞøñ¡ æóÇáäøóÇÑó ÍóŞøñ¡ ÃóÏúÎóáóåõ Çááåõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó Úóáóì ãóÇ ßóÇäó ãöäó ÇáúÚóãóá»</div><br>  (If anyone testifies that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah Alone Who has no partners, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and that `Isa is Allah's servant and Messenger and His Word which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit created by Him, and that Paradise is true and Hell is true, then Allah will admit him into Paradise with the deeds which he performed.) In another narration, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãöäú ÃóÈúæóÇÈö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÇáËøóãóÇäöíøóÉö íóÏúÎõáõ ãöäú ÃóíøöåóÇ ÔóÇÁ»</div><br>  (...through any of the eight doors of Paradise he wishes.) Muslim also recorded it. Therefore, `Ruh from Allah', in the Ayah and the Hadith is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÎøóÑó áóßõãú ãøóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÌóãöíÚÇğ ãøöäúåõ</div><br>  (And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; it is all from Him.) meaning, from His creation. `from Him' does not mean that it is a part of Him, as the Christians claim, may Allah's continued curses be upon them. Saying that something is from Allah, such as the spirit of Allah, the she-camel of Allah or the House of Allah, is meant to honor such items. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞöåö äóÇŞóÉõ Çááøóåö</div><br>  (This is the she-camel of Allah...) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóØóåøöÑú ÈóíúÊöìó áöáØøóÂÆöİöíäó</div><br>  (and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it.)

Allah said after that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóŞõæáõæÇú ËóáóÜËóÉñ</div><br>  (Say not: "Three!") do not elevate `Isa and his mother to be gods with Allah.

The Christians, may Allah curse them, have no limit to their disbelief because of their ignorance, so their deviant statements and their misguidance grows. Some of them believe that `Isa is Allah, some believe that he is one in a trinity and some believe that he is the son of Allah. Their beliefs and creeds are numerous and contradict each other, prompting some people to say that if ten Christians meet, they would end up with eleven sects! <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Christian Sects</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Sa`id bin Batriq, the Patriarch of Alexandria and a famous Christian scholar, mentioned in the year four hundred after the Hijrah, that a Christian Council convened during the reign of Constantine, who built the city that bears his name. In this Council, the Christians came up with what they called the Great Trust, which in reality is the Great Treachery. There were more than two thousand patriarchs in this Council, and they were in such disarray that they divided into many sects, where some sects had twenty, fifty or a hundred members, etc.! When the king saw that there were more than three hundred Patriarchs who had the same idea, he agreed with them and adopted their creed. Constantine who was a deviant philosopher -- gave his support to this sect for which, as an honor, churches were built and doctrines were taught to young children, who were baptized on this creed, and books were written about it. Meanwhile, the king oppressed all other sects. Another Council produced the sect known as the Jacobites, while the Nestorians were formed in a third Council. These three sects agreed that `Isa was divine, but disputed regarding the manner in which `Isa's divinity was related to his humanity; were they in unity or did Allah incarnate in `Isa! All three of these sects accuse each other of heresy and, we believe that all three of them are disbelievers. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇäÊóåõæÇú ÎóíúÑÇğ áøóßõãú</div><br>  (Cease!
