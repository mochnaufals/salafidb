Camels may be ridden or eaten; their milk is drunk and they are used for carrying heavy burdens on journeys to distant lands. Cattle are eaten and their milk is drunk; they are also used for plowing the earth. Sheep are eaten and their milk is also drunk. The hair and wool of all of these animals is used to make tents, clothing and furnishings, as we have already discussed in Surat Al-An`am and Surat An-Nahl, etc. Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóáó áóßõãõ ÇáÇøñäúÚóÜãó áöÊóÑúßóÜÈõæÇú ãöäúåóÇ æóãöäúåóÇ ÊóÃúßõáõæäó - æóáóßõãú İöíåóÇ ãóäóÜİöÚõ æóáöÊóÜÈúáõÛõæÇú ÚóáóíúåóÇ ÍóÇÌóÉğ İöì ÕõÏõæÑößõãú æóÚóáóíúåóÇ æóÚóáóì Çáúİõáúßö ÊõÍúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (Allah, it is He Who has made cattle for you, that you may ride on some of them, and of some you eat.
