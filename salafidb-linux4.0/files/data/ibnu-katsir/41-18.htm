They saw the punishment Allah sent upon His enemies, and the blessings which He bestowed upon His friends, yet despite all of this, they did not believe in them. On the contrary, they denied them and rejected them, and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú ÔóÂÁó ÑóÈøõäóÇ áÇøäÒóáó ãóáóÜÆößóÉğ</div><br>  (If our Lord had so willed, He would surely have sent down the angels.) meaning, if Allah were to send Messengers, they would be angels sent from His presence.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóÇ ÈöãóÂ ÃõÑúÓöáúÊõãú Èöåö ßóÜİöÑõæäó</div><br>  (So, indeed we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.) means, `because you are a mere human; we will not follow you because you are just men like us.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóãøóÇ ÚóÇÏñ İóÇÓúÊóßúÈóÑõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÈöÛóíúÑö ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right.) means, they were arrogant, stubborn and disobedient.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú ãóäú ÃóÔóÏøõ ãöäøóÇ ŞõæøóÉğ</div><br>  (and they said: "Who is mightier than us in strength'') They boasted of their physical strength, and power; they thought that this would protect them from Allah's punishment.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæóáóãú íóÑóæúÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞóåõãú åõæó ÃóÔóÏøõ ãöäúåõãú ŞõæøóÉğ</div><br>  (See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them.) means, do they not realize, when they are showing enmity, that He is the Almighty Who created all things and gave them whatever strength they have, and that His onslaught will be far greater This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóãóÂÁó ÈóäóíúäóÜåóÇ ÈöÃóíúÏò æóÅöäøóÇ áóãõæÓöÚõæäó </div><br>  (With Hands did We construct the heaven.

Some said that this was a strongly blowing wind; others said that it was a cold wind. It was also said that it is the wind that makes a noise. The truth that it was all of these things, for it was a strong wind that was an apt punishment for their being deceived by their physical strength. It was also intensely cold, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÑöíÍò ÕóÑúÕóÑò ÚóÇÊöíóÉò</div><br>  (with a Sarsar wind!) (69:6), meaning a very cold wind. It also made a furious sound. Additionally, there is a famous river in the east which is called Sarsar because of the noise it makes as it flows.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÃóíøóÇãò äøóÍöÓóÇÊò</div><br>  (in days of calamity) means, consecutive days.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÈúÚó áóíóÇáò æóËóãóÜäöíóÉó ÃóíøóÇãò ÍõÓõæãÇğ</div><br>  (seven nights and eight days in succession) (69: 7).
