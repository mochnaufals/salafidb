So he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÆöäö ÇÊøóÎóĞúÊó ÅöáóÜåóÇğ ÛóíúÑöì áÃóÌúÚóáóäøóßó ãöäó ÇáúãóÓúÌõæäöíäó</div><br>  (If you choose a god other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners.)

It was shining like a piece of the moon. Since Fir`awn was already doomed, he hastened to stubborn denial, and said to the chiefs around him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóÜĞóÇ áóÓóÜÍöÑñ Úóáöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, this is indeed a well-versed sorcerer.) One who knows a great deal of magic or witchcraft. Fir`awn was trying to convince them that this was sorcery, not a miracle. Then he provoked them against Musa, trying to make them oppose him and disbelieve in him, and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÑöíÏõ Ãóä íõÎúÑöÌóßõãú ãøöäú ÃóÑúÖößõãú ÈöÓöÍúÑöåö</div><br>  (He wants to drive you out of your land by his sorcery...) meaning, `he wants to capture the people's hearts and win them over by doing this, so that they will support him, and help him and follow him, and he will defeat you in your own land and take the land from you.

So Fir`awn did as they suggested, which is what Allah decreed would happen to them, so that all the people would gather in one place and the signs and proof of Allah would be made manifest before them all in one day.  </div></body></html>
