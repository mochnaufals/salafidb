If this is the case with a mountain which is hard and huge, that if it was made able to comprehend and understand this Qur'an, will feel humble and crumble from fear of Allah the Exalted, then what about you -- O mankind Why do your hearts not feel softness and humbleness from the fear of Allah, even though you understand Allah's command and comprehend His Book This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊöáúßó ÇáÇøñãúËóÜáõ äóÖúÑöÈõåóÇ áöáäøóÇÓö áóÚóáøóåõãú íóÊóİóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect.) There is a Hadith of the Mutawatir grade that states that the Messenger of Allah had someone make him a Minbar. Before that, he used to stand next to a tree trunk in the Masjid to deliver speeches. So, when the Minbar was made and placed in the Masjid, the Prophet came to deliver a speech and passed the tree trunk, headed towards the Minbar, the tree trunk started weeping, just like an infant. The tree trunk missed hearing the remembrance of Allah and the revelation that were being recited next to it. In one of the narrations for this Hadith, Al-Hasan Al-Basri said after narrating the Hadith, "You - mankind -- are more worthy to miss the Messenger of Allah than the tree trunk!'' tLikewise, this honorable Ayah asks that if the solid mountains feel humble and are rent asunder from the fear of Allah, if it heard Allah's Speech and comprehended it, what about you -- O mankind -- who heard the Qur'an and understood it Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú Ãóäøó ŞõÑúÂäğÇ ÓõíøöÑóÊú Èöåö ÇáúÌöÈóÇáõ Ãóæú ŞõØøöÚóÊú Èöåö ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ Ãóæú ßõáøöãó Èöåö ÇáúãóæúÊóì</div><br>  (And if there had been a Qur'an with which mountains could be moved, or the earth could be cloven asunder, or the dead could be made to speak.)(13:31) We mentioned the meaning of this Ayah as stating that, if there were a Qur'an that has these qualities, it would be this Qur'an. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ãöäó ÇáúÍöÌóÇÑóÉö áóãóÇ íóÊóİóÌøóÑõ ãöäúåõ ÇáÃóäúåóÜÑõ æóÅöäøó ãöäúåóÇ áóãóÇ íóÔøóŞøóŞõ İóíóÎúÑõÌõ ãöäúåõ ÇáúãóÂÁõ æóÅöäøó ãöäúåóÇ áóãóÇ íóåúÈöØõ ãöäú ÎóÔúíóÉö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which split asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them which fall down for fear of Allah.)(2:74) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Glorifying Allah the Exalted by mentioning His Names and Attributes</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó ÚóÇáöãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÇáÔøóåóÜÏóÉö åõæó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ ÇáÑøóÍöíãõ </div><br>  (He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.) Allah states that He Alone is worthy of worship, there is no Lord or God for the existence, except Him. All that is being worshipped instead of Allah are false deities. Allah is the All-Knower in the unseen and the seen, He knows all that pertains to the creations that we see, and those we cannot see. Nothing in heaven or on earth ever escapes His knowledge, no matter how great or insignificant, big or small, including ants in darkness. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ ÇáÑøóÍöíãõ</div><br>  (He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.) was duly explained before at the very beginning of this Tafsir, so it is not necessary to repeat it here, and it asserts that Allah is the Owner of the wide encompassing mercy that entails all of His creation. He is Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim of this life and the Hereafter. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÍúãóÊöì æóÓöÚóÊú ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (And My mercy embraces all things.)(7:156),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÊóÈó ÑóÈøõßõãú Úóáóì äóİúÓöåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÉó</div><br>  (Your Lord has written (prescribed) mercy for Himself.)(6:54), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÈöİóÖúáö Çááøóåö æóÈöÑóÍúãóÊöåö İóÈöĞóáößó İóáúíóİúÑóÍõæÇú åõæó ÎóíúÑñ ãøöãøóÇ íóÌúãóÚõæäó </div><br>  (Say: "In the bounty of Allah, and in His mercy; -- therein let them rejoice.''

Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúŞõÏøõæÓõ</div><br>  (Al-Quddus,) meaning "The Pure,'' according to Wahb bin Munabbih, while Mujahid and Qatadah said that Al-Quddus means "The Blessed.'' Ibn Jurayj said that Al-Quddus means "He Whom the honorable angels glorify.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÓøóáóÜãõ</div><br>  (As-Salam,) meaning "Free from any defects or shortcomings that lessen or decrease His perfect attributes and actions.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúãõÄúãöäõ</div><br>  (Al-Mu'min,) means "Who has granted safety to His servants by promising that He will never be unjust to them, '' according to Ad-Dahhak who reported it from Ibn `Abbas. Qatadah said that Al-Mu'min means that "Allah affirms that His statements are true,'' while Ibn Zayd said that it means, "He attested to His faithful servants' having faith in Him.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çáúãõåóíúãöäõ</div><br>  (Al-Muhaymin,) means, according to Ibn `Abbas and others, "The Witness for His servants actions,'' that is, the Ever-Watcher over them.

Therefore, His majesty is never violated, due to His might, greatness, irresistible power and pride. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÌóÈøóÇÑõ ÇáúãõÊóßóÈøöÑõ</div><br>  (Al-Jabbar, Al-Mutakabbir), meaning "The Only One worthy of being the Compeller and Supreme.''

Al-Khaliq refers to measuring and proportioning, Al-Bari refers to inventing and bringing into existence what He has created and measured.
