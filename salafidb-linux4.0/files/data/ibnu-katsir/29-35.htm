They first came to Ibrahim in the form of guests, so he offered them hospitality in the appropriate manner. When he saw that they had no interest in the food, he felt some mistrust of them and was fearful of them. They started to calm him down and gave him the news of a righteous son born by his wife Sarah, who was present, and she was astonished by this, as we have already explained in our Tafsir of Surat Hud and Surat Al-Hijr. When they brought this news to Ibrahim and told him that they were sent to destroy the people of Lut, he began to speak up for them, hoping to win more time for them so that they might be guided by Allah. When they said, "We have come to destroy the people of this township,''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó Åöäøó İöíåóÇ áõæØÇğ ŞóÇáõæÇú äóÍúäõ ÃóÚúáóãõ Èöãóä İöíåóÇ áóäõäóÌøöíóäøóåõ æóÃóåúáóåõ ÅöáÇøó ÇãúÑóÃóÊóåõ ßóÇäóÊú ãöäó ÇáúÛóÜÈöÑöíäó </div><br>  ((Ibrahim) said: "But there is Lut in it.''

Then the angels left him and visited Lut in the form of handsome young men.

Jibril, peace be upon him, uprooted their town from the depths of the earth, lifted it up to the sky, then threw it upside down upon them.
