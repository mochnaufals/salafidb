The following is recorded in the books of the Sunan:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÒóæóÇáõ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÚöäúÏó Çááåö Ãóåúæóäõ ãöäú ŞóÊúáö ãõÓúáöã»</div><br>  (If the world were to be destroyed, it would be of less importance to Allah than the killing of a Muslim.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä ŞõÊöáó ãóÙúáõæãğÇ İóŞóÏú ÌóÚóáúäóÇ áöæóáöíøöåö ÓõáúØóÜäÇğ</div><br>  (And whoever is killed wrongfully, We have given his heir the authority.) The authority is over the killer. The heir has the choice; if he wishes, he may have him killed in retaliation, or he may forgive him in return for the payment of the Diyah (blood money), or he may forgive him with no payment, as is reported in the Sunnah. The great scholar and Imam Ibn `Abbas understood from the general meaning of this Ayah that Mu`awiyah should take power, because he was the heir of `Uthman, who had been killed wrongfully, may Allah be pleased with him, and Mu`awiyah did event- ually take power, as Ibn `Abbas said on the basis of this Ayah. This is one of the stranger of matters.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó íõÓúÑöİ İøöì ÇáúŞóÊúáö</div><br>  (But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life.) They said: this means the heir should not go to extremes in killing the killer, such as mutilating the body or taking revenge on persons other than the killer.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ãóäúÕõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (Verily, he is helped.) means, the heir is helped against the killer by the Shari`ah and by divine decree.  </div></body></html>
