These disbelievers mock the most important acts that any person could ever perform, the honorable, pure acts of Islam which include all types of good for this life and the Hereafter. They mock such acts and make them the subject of jest and play, because this is what these acts represent in their misguided minds and cold hearts. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ãöä ŞóÈúáößõãú æóÇáúßõİøóÇÑó</div><br>  (from those who received the Scriptures before you and (nor) the disbelievers...)  This is to clarify the particular category (of disbelievers). As Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáÑøöÌúÓó ãöäó ÇáÇøñæúËóÜäö</div><br>  (So shun the evil of the idols...) 22:30 So some recited it "Kuffari'', making it an object of the preposition, and others recited it "Kuffara'', making it a predicate noun;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÊøóÎóĞõæÇú Ïöíäóßõãú åõÒõæÇğ æóáóÚöÈÇğ ãøöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ãöä ŞóÈúáößõãú</div><br>  (Take not as friends those who take your religion for a mockery and fun from those who received the Scriptures before you...) with the meaning of "nor'',   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúßõİøóÇÑó ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó</div><br>  (nor the disbelievers as friends) That is, do not take these people nor those people as friends. The meaning here of "Kuffar'' disbelievers is idolators. Similarly, Ibn Jarir recorded that in the recitation of Ibn Mas`ud in place of "Kuffar'' he recited it: "and those who commit Shirk. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó Åöä ßõäÊõã ãøõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  (And have Taqwa of Allah if you indeed are true believers.) means, fear Allah and do not take the enemies of you and your religion as friends, if you believe in Allah's Law and religion that these people mocked and jested about. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóÊøóÎöĞö ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó ãöä Ïõæäö ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó æóãóä íóİúÚóáú Ğóáößó İóáóíúÓó ãöäó Çááøóåö İöí ÔóìúÁò ÅöáÇó Ãóä ÊóÊøóŞõæÇú ãöäúåõãú ÊõŞóÜÉğ æóíõÍóĞøöÑúßõãõ Çááøóåõ äóİúÓóåõ æóÅöáóì Çááøóåö ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ </div><br>  (Let not the believers take the disbelievers as friends instead of the believers, and whoever does that, will never be helped by Allah in any way, except if you indeed fear a danger from them. And Allah warns you against Himself, and to Allah is the final return.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Disbelievers Mock the Prayer and the Adhan</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ äóÜÏóíúÊõãú Åöáóì ÇáÕøóáóæÉö ÇÊøóÎóĞõæåóÇ åõÒõæÇğ æóáóÚöÈÇğ</div><br>  (And when you proclaim the call for the Salah, they take it (but) as a mockery and fun;) When you proclaim the Adhan for the prayer, which is the best action there is, for those who have sound minds and good comprehension,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÊøóÎóĞõæåóÇ</div><br>  (they take it...) also,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõÒõæÇğ æóáóÚöÈÇğ Ğáößó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú Şóæúãñ áÇøó íóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (as a mockery and fun; that is because they are a people who understand not.) the acts of worship and Allah's Law. These are the characteristics of the followers of Shaytan who,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÓóãöÚó ÇáúÃóĞóÇäó ÃóÏúÈóÑó æóáóåõ ÍõÕóÇÕñ¡ Ãóíú ÖõÑóÇØñ¡ ÍóÊøóì áóÇ íóÓúãóÚó ÇáÊøóÃúĞöíäó İóÅöĞóÇ ŞõÖöíó ÇáÊøóÃúĞöíäõ¡ ÃóŞúÈóáó İóÅöĞóÇ ËõæøöÈó áöáÕøóáóÇÉö ÃóÏúÈóÑó¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ŞõÖöíó ÇáÊøóËúæöíÈõ ÃóŞúÈóáó ÍóÊøóì íóÎúØõÑó Èóíúäó ÇáúãóÑúÁö æóŞóáúÈöåö¡ İóíóŞõæáõ: ÇĞúßõÑú ßóĞóÇ ÇĞúßõÑú ßóĞóÇ¡ áöãóÇ áóãú íóßõäú íóĞúßõÑõ ÍóÊøóì íóÙóáøó ÇáÑøóÌõáõ áóÇ íóÏúÑöí ßóãú Õóáøóì¡ İóÅöĞóÇ æóÌóÏó ÃóÍóÏõßõãú Ğáößó¡ İóáúíóÓúÌõÏú ÓóÌúÏóÊóíúäö ŞóÈúáó ÇáÓøóáóÇã»</div><br>  (When the call for prayer is made, Shaytan takes to his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the Adhan. When the call is finished he comes back, and when the Iqamah is pronounced, Shaytan again takes to his heels. When the Iqamah is finished he comes back again and tries to interfere with the person and his thoughts and to say, `Remember this and that,' which he has not thought of before the prayer, until the praying person forgets how much he has prayed. If anyone of you does not remember, then he should perform two prostrations before pronouncing the Salam.) This Hadith is agreed upon. Az-Zuhri said, "Allah mentioned the Adhan in His Book,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ äóÜÏóíúÊõãú Åöáóì ÇáÕøóáóæÉö ÇÊøóÎóĞõæåóÇ åõÒõæÇğ æóáóÚöÈÇğ Ğáößó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú Şóæúãñ áÇøó íóÚúŞöáõæäó </div><br>  (And when you proclaim the call for the Salah, they take it (but) as a mockery and fun; that is because they are a people who understand not.)'' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement.  </div></body></html>
