Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú íóãúßõÑõ Èößó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú áöíõËúÈöÊõæßó Ãóæú íóŞúÊõáõæßó Ãóæú íõÎúÑöÌõæßó æóíóãúßõÑõæäó æóíóãúßõÑõ Çááøóåõ æóÇááøóåõ ÎóíúÑõ ÇáúãóÜßöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted against you to imprison you, or to kill you, or to expell you; they were plotting and Allah too was plotting; and Allah is the best of those who plot.) 8:30,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÎúÑöÌõæäó ÇáÑøóÓõæáó æóÅöíøóÜßõãú Ãóä ÊõÄúãöäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö ÑóÈøößõãú</div><br>  (...and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves (from your homeland) because you believe in Allah your Lord!) 60:1, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ßóÇÏõæÇú áóíóÓúÊóİöÒøõæäóßó ãöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö áöíõÎúÑöÌõæßó ãöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (And verily, they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land.) 17:76 Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõã ÈóÏóÁõæßõãú Ãóæøóáó ãóÑøóÉò</div><br>  (while they did attack you first), refers to the battle of Badr when the idolators marched to protect their caravan. When they knew that their caravan escaped safely, they still went ahead with their intent to fight Muslims out of arrogance, as we mentioned before. It was also said that these Ayat refer to the idolators breaking the peace agreement with Muslims and aiding Bani Bakr, their allies, against Khuza`ah, the ally of the Messenger of Allah . This is why the Messenger of Allah marched to Makkah in the year of the victory, thus conquering it, all thanks and praise is due to Allah. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊóÎúÔóæúäóåõãú İóÇááøóåõ ÃóÍóŞøõ Ãóä ÊóÎúÔóæúåõ Åöä ßõäÊõã ãøõÄõãöäöíäó</div><br>  (Do you fear them Allah has more right that you should fear Him if you are believers.) Allah says here, `Do not fear idolators, but fear Me instead, for I am worthy of being feared by the servants due to My might and punishment. In My Hand lies the matter; whatever I will occurs, and whatever I do not will does not occur.' Allah next said, while ordering the believers and explaining the wisdom of ordaining Jihad against them, all the while able to destroy their enemies with a command from Him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÜÊöáõæåõãú íõÚóĞøöÈúåõãõ Çááøóåõ ÈöÃóíúÏöíßõãú æóíõÎúÒöåöãú æóíóäúÕõÑúßõãú Úóáóíúåöãú æóíóÔúİö ÕõÏõæÑó Şóæúãò ãøõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (Fight against them so that Allah will punish them by your hands, and disgrace them and give you victory over them, and heal the breasts of a believing people.)  This Ayah includes all believers, even though Mujahid, `Ikrimah and As-Suddi said that it refers to Khuza`ah. Concerning the believers, Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõĞúåöÈú ÛóíúÙó ŞõáõæÈöåöãú</div><br>  (and remove the anger of their hearts), then   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÊõæÈõ Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (Allah accepts the repentance of whom He wills), from His servants,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ Úóáöíãñ</div><br>  (Allah is All-Knowing), in what benefits His servants,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (All-Wise), in His actions and statements, whether narrative or legislative. Allah does what He wills, decides what He wills, and He is the Just Who never wrongs any. Not even the weight of an atom of good or evil is ever neglected with Him, but rather, He compensates for it in this life and the Hereafter.  </div></body></html>
