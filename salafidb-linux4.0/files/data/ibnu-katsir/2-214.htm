An authentic Hadith narrated that Khabbab bin Al-Aratt said, "We said, `O Messenger of Allah!

(29:1-3)  The Companions experienced tremendous trials during the battle of Al-Ahzab (the Confederates).

There, the believers were tried and shaken with a mighty shaking. And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubts) said: "Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion!'') (33:10-12)  When Heraclius asked Abu Sufyan, "Did you fight him (Prophet Muhammad)'' He said, "Yes.'' Heraclius said, "What was the outcome of warfare between you'' Abu Sufyan said, "Sometimes we lose and sometimes he loses.'' He said, "Such is the case with Prophets, they are tested, but the final victory is theirs.''

Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) (94:5, 6)  So just as there is hardship, its equal of relief will soon arrive.
