He explains that if He made the night continuous, lasting until the Day of Resurrection, that would be harmful for them and would cause boredom and stress. So He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>гудъ ≈цбу№ес џунъ—х «ббшуец ну√ъ цняхгъ »ц÷цну¬Ѕт</div><br>  (which god besides Allah could bring you light) meaning, `with which you could see things and which would bring you relief'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>√уЁуб«у  у”ъгуЏхжду</div><br>  (Will you not then hear) Then Allah tells us that if He had made the day continuous, lasting until the Day of Resurrection, that would also be harmful for them and their bodies would get tired from so much movement and activity. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>гудъ ≈цбу№ес џунъ—х «ббшуец ну√ъ цняхгъ »цбунъбт  у”ъяхдхжду Ёцнец</div><br>  (which god besides Allah could bring you night wherein you rest) meaning, `to rest from your work and activity.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>√уЁб«у  х»ъ’ц—хждужугцд —шуЌъгу цец</div><br>  (Will you not then see It is out of His mercy) towards you,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ћуЏубу буяхгх «бшунъбу жу«бдшуеу«—у</div><br>  (that He has made for you the night and the day) He created both,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>бц у”ъяхдхж«ъ Ёцнец</div><br>  (that you may rest therein) during the night,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жубц у»ъ уџхж«ъ гцд Ёу÷ъбцец</div><br>  (and that you may seek of His bounty) during the day, by traveling, moving about and working.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жубуЏубшуяхгъ  у‘ъях—хжду</div><br>  (and in order that you may be grateful.) So that you may give thanks to Allah by performing all kinds of acts of worship at night and during the day. Whoever misses something during the night can make it up during the day, and vice versa. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жуехжу «бшу–цм ћуЏубу «бшунъбу жу«бдшуеу«—у ќцбъЁу…р бшцгудъ √у—у«ѕу √уд ну–шуяшу—у √ужъ √у—у«ѕу ‘хяхж—«р </div><br>  (And He it is Who has put the night and the day in succession, for such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.) (25:62). And there are many similar Ayat.  </div></body></html>
