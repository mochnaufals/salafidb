That discussion is sufficient without any need for repetition here. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõÍúßöãóÊú ÁÇíóÜÊõåõ Ëõãøó İõÕøöáóÊú</div><br>  (The Ayat whereof are perfect and then explained in detail) This means perfect in its wording, detailed in its meaning. Thus, it is complete in its form and its meaning. This interpretation was reported from Mujahid and Qatadah, and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari preferred it. Concerning the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä áøóÏõäú Íóßöíãò ÎóÈöíÑò</div><br>  (from One (Allah), Who is All-Wise, Well-Acquainted.) This means that it (the Qur'an) is from Allah, Who is Most Wise in His statements and His Laws, and Most Aware of the final outcome of matters.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇøó ÊóÚúÈõÏõæÇú ÅöáÇøó Çááøóåó</div><br>  ((Saying) worship none but Allah.) This means that this Qur'an descended, perfect and detailed, with the purpose of Allah's worship alone, without any partners. This is similar to the statement of Allah, the Exalted,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ãöä ÑøóÓõæáò ÅöáÇøó äõæÍöì Åöáóíúåö Ãóäøóåõ áÇ ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó ÃóäóÇú İóÇÚúÈõÏõæäö </div><br>  (And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying): There is no God but I, so worship Me.) 21:25 It is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÈóÚóËúäóÇ İöì ßõáøö ÃõãøóÉò ÑøóÓõæáÇğ Ãóäö ÇÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáúØøóÜÛõæÊó</div><br>  (And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): `Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut (calling false deities.)')16:36  In reference to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóäöì áóßõãú ãøöäúåõ äóĞöíÑñ æóÈóÔöíÑñ</div><br>  (Verily, I am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.) This means, "Verily, I am unto you a warner of the punishment if you oppose Him (Allah), and a bringer of the good news of reward if you obey Him.'' This meaning has been recorded in the authentic Hadith which states that the Messenger of Allah ascended mount As-Safa and called out to his near relatives of the Quraysh tribe. When they gathered around him, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ãóÚúÔóÑó ŞõÑóíúÔò ÃóÑóÃóíúÊõãú áóæú ÃóÎúÈóÑúÊõßõãú Ãóäøó ÎóíúáğÇ ÊõÕóÈøöÍõßõãú ÃóáóÓúÊõãú ãõÕóÏøöŞöíøó¿»</div><br>  (O people of Quraysh, if I informed you that a cavalry was going to attack you in the morning, would you not believe me) They replied, "We have not found you to be a liar.'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöäøöí äóĞöíÑñ áóßõãú Èóíúäó íóÏóí ÚóĞóÇÈò ÔóÏöíÏ»</div><br>  (Verily I am a warner unto you before a severe punishment.) Concerning His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäö ÇÓúÊóÛúİöÑõæÇú ÑóÈøóßõãú Ëõãøó ÊõæÈõæÇú Åöáóíúåö íõãóÊøöÚúßõãú ãøóÊóÇÚğÇ ÍóÓóäğÇ Åöáóì ÃóÌóáò ãøõÓóãøğì æóíõÄúÊö ßõáøó Ğöí İóÖúáò İóÖúáóåõ</div><br>  (And (commanding you): `Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) This means, "I am commanding you to seek forgiveness from previous sins and to turn to Allah from future sins, and thereafter you abide by that.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõãóÊøöÚúßõãú ãøóÊóÇÚğÇ ÍóÓóäğÇ</div><br>  (that He may grant you good enjoyment,) This is in reference to this worldly life.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì ÃóÌóáò ãøõÓóãøğì æóíõÄúÊö ßõáøó Ğöí İóÖúáò İóÖúáóåõ</div><br>  (for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) This refers to the Hereafter, according to Qatadah. "This is like the statement of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóäú Úóãöáó ÕóÜáöÍÇğ ãøöä ĞóßóÑò Ãóæú ÃõäúËóì æóåõæó ãõÄúãöäñ İóáóäõÍúíöíóäøóåõ ÍóíóæÉğ ØóíøöÈóÉğ</div><br>  (Whoever works righteousness -- whether male or female -- while a true believer, verily to him We will give a good life.)16:97 Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÊóæóáøóæúÇú İóÅöäøöí ÃóÎóÇİõ Úóáóíúßõãú ÚóĞóÇÈó íóæúãò ßóÈöíÑò</div><br>  (But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.) This is a severe threat for whoever turns away from the commandments of Allah, the Exalted, and rejects His Messengers. Verily, the punishment will afflict such a person on the Day of Resurrection and there will be no escape from it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì Çááå ãóÑúÌöÚõßõãú</div><br>  (To Allah is your return,) This is means your return on the Day of Judgement.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ</div><br>  (and He is able to do all things.) This means that He is capable of doing whatever He wishes, whether it be goodness towards His Awliya' (friends and allies), or vengeance upon His enemies. This also includes His ability to repeat the creation of His creatures on the Day of Resurrection. This section encourages fear, just as the previous section encourages hope.  </div></body></html>
