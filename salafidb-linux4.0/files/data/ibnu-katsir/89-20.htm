But this is not the case, rather it is a trial and a test, as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíóÍúÓóÈõæäó ÃóäøóãóÇ äõãöÏøõåõãú Èöåö ãöä ãøóÇáò æóÈóäöíäó - äõÓóÇÑöÚõ áóåõãú İöì ÇáúÎóíúÑóÊö Èóá áÇøó íóÔúÚõÑõæäó </div><br>  (Do they think that in wealth and children with which We enlarge them. We hasten unto them with good things. Nay, but they perceive not.) (23:55-56) Likewise, from another angle, if Allah tests him and tries him by curtailing his sustenance, he believes that is because Allah is humiliating him. As Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó</div><br>  (But no!) meaning, the matter is not as he claims, neither in this nor in that. For indeed Allah gives wealth to those whom He loves as well as those whom He does not love. Likewise, He withholds sustenance from those whom He loves and those whom He does not love. The point is that Allah should be obeyed in either circumstance. If one is wealthy, he should thank Allah for that, and if he is poor, he should exercise patience. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>From the Evil that the Servant does regarding Wealth</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóá áÇøó ÊõßúÑöãõæäó ÇáúíóÊöíãó-</div><br>  (But you treat not the orphans with kindness and generosity!)
