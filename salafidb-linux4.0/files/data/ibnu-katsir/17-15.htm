This is the issue of children who die when they are little, and their parents are disbelievers: what happens to them By the same token, what happens to the insane, the deaf, the senile and those who die during the circumstances of Fatrah, when no Message reached them Several Hadiths have been narrated on this topic, which I will quote here by the help and support of Allah. The First Hadith from Al-Aswad bin Sar ®299º Imam Ahmad reported from Al-Aswad bin Sari' that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÑúÈóÚóÉñ íóÍúÊóÌøõæäó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö: ÑóÌõáñ ÃóÕóãøõ áóÇ íóÓúãóÚõ ÔóíúÆğÇ¡ æóÑóÌõáñ ÃóÍúãóŞõ¡ æóÑóÌõáñ åóÑöãñ¡ æóÑóÌõáñ ãóÇÊó İöí İóÊúÑóÉò¡ İóÃóãøóÇ ÇáúÃóÕóãøõ İóíóŞõæáõ: ÑóÈøö ŞóÏú ÌóÇÁó ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãõ æóãóÇ ÃóÓúãóÚõ ÔóíúÆğÇ¡ æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáúÃóÍúãóŞõ İóíóŞõæáõ: ÑóÈøö ŞóÏú ÌóÇÁó ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãõ æóÇáÕøöÈúíóÇäõ íóÍúĞöİõæäöí ÈöÇáúÈóÚúÑö¡ æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáúåóÑöãõ İóíóŞõæáõ: ÑóÈøö áóŞóÏú ÌóÇÁó ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãõ æóãóÇ ÃóÚúŞöáõ ÔóíúÆğÇ¡ æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáøóĞöí ãóÇÊó İöí ÇáúİóÊúÑóÉö İóíóŞõæáõ: ÑóÈøö ãóÇ ÃóÊóÇäöí áóßó ÑóÓõæáñ.

As for the deaf man, he will say, "O Lord, Islam came but I never heard anything.'' As for the insane man, he will say, "O Lord, Islam came and the young boys were throwing camel dung at me.'' As for the senile man, he will say, "O Lord, Islam came and I did not understand anything.'' As for the one who died during the Fatrah, he will say, "O Lord, no Messenger from You came to me.'' Allah will accept their pledge of obedience to Him, then He will send word to them that they should enter the Fire. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, if they enter it, it will be cool and safe for them.) There is a similar report with a chain from Qatadah from Al-Hasan from Abu Rafi` from Abu Hurayrah, but at the end it says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóãóäú ÏóÎóáóåóÇ ßóÇäóÊú Úóáóíúåö ÈóÑúÏğÇ æóÓóáóÇãğÇ¡ æóãóäú áóãú íóÏúÎõáúåóÇ íõÓúÍóÈõ ÅöáóíúåóÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever enters it will find it cool and safe, and whoever does not enter it will be dragged into it.) This was also recorded by Ishaq bin Rahwayh from Mu`adh bin Hisham, and by Al-Bayhaqi in Al-I`tiqad. He said: "This is a Sahih chain.'' It was reported by Ibn Jarir from the Hadith of Ma`mar from Hammam from Abu Hurayrah, who attributed it to the Prophet . Then Abu Hurayrah said: "Recite, if you wish:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßõäøóÇ ãõÚóĞøöÈöíäó ÍóÊøóì äóÈúÚóËó ÑóÓõæáÇğ</div><br>  (And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)).'' This was also narrated by Ma`mar from `Abdullah bin Tawus from his father, from Abu Hurayrah, but it is Mauquf (it was not attributed directly to the Prophet ). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Second Hadith from Abu Hurayrah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  He said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáøõ ãóæúáõæÏò íõæáóÏõ Úóáóì ÇáúİöØúÑóÉö¡ İóÃóÈóæóÇåõ íõåóæøöÏóÇäöåö Ãóæú íõäóÕøöÑóÇäöåö Ãóæú íõãóÌøöÓóÇäöåö¡ ßóãóÇ ÊõäúÊöÌõ ÇáúÈóåöíãóÉõ ÈóåöíãóÉğ ÌóãúÚóÇÁó¡ åóáú ÊõÍöÓøõæäó İöíåóÇ ãöäú ÌóÏúÚóÇÁó¿»</div><br>  (Every newborn is born in a state of Fitrah (the natural state of man), then his parents make him into a Jew or Christian or Zoroastrian, as animals produce whole animals - do you see any that is born mutilated (with something missing))  According to one report they said: "O Messenger of Allah, what about those who die when they are little'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááåõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇ ÚóÇãöáöíä»</div><br>  (Allah knows best what they would have done.)

For this reason some of the scholars did not like to discuss it. This view has been narrated from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Qasim bin Muhammad bin Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah and others. Ibn Hibban recorded in his Sahih that Jarir bin Hazim said: I heard Abu Raja' Al-`Utardi saying that he heard Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) saying, "While he was on the Minbar, the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóÒóÇáõ ÃóãúÑõ åóĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉö ãõæóÇÊöíğÇ Ãóæú ãõŞóÇÑöÈóÇ ãóÇ áóãú íóÊóßóáøóãõæÇ İöí ÇáúæöáúÏóÇäö æóÇáúŞóÏóÑ»</div><br>  (This Ummah will be fine so long as they do not talk about children and the divine decree.)'' Ibn Hibban said: "This means talking about the children of the idolators.'' Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar also recorded it via Jarir bin Hazim, then he said, "A group narrated it from Abu Raja' from Ibn `Abbas, but it is Mauquf''.  </div></body></html>
