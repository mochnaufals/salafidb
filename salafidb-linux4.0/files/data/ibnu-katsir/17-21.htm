Allah says:</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó</div><br>  On each meaning, on each of the two groups, those who desire this world and those who desire the Hereafter, We bestow what they want   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöäú ÚóØóÂÁö ÑóÈøößó</div><br>  (from the bounties of your Lord.) means, He is the One Who is in control of all things, and He is never unjust. He gives to each what he deserves, whether it is eternal happiness or doom. His decree is unstoppable, no one can withhold what He gives or change what He wants. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÚóØóÂÁõ ÑóÈøößó ãóÍúÙõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (And the bounties of your Lord can never be forbidden.) meaning, no one can withhold or prevent them.

Some of them will be in varying levels of Hell, in chains and fetters, while others will be in the lofty degrees of Paradise, with its blessings and delights. The people of Hell will vary in their positions and levels, just as the people of Paradise will. In Paradise there are one hundred levels, and the distance between one level and another is like the distance between heaven and earth. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Ãóåúáó ÇáÏøóÑóÌóÇÊö ÇáúÚõáóì áóíóÑóæúäó Ãóåúáó Úöáøöíøöíäó ßóãóÇ ÊóÑóæúäó ÇáúßóæúßóÈó ÇáúÛóÇÈöÑó İöí ÃõİõŞö ÇáÓøóãóÇÁ»</div><br>  (The people of the highest levels (of Paradise) will see the people of `Illiyin as if they are looking at distant stars on the horizon.)
