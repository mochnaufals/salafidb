Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íóæúãó ÇáúİóÊúÍö</div><br>  (Say: "On the Day of Al-Fath...'') meaning, `when the wrath and punishment of Allah befall you, in this world and the next,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóäİóÚõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÅöíóãóÜäõåõãú æóáÇó åõãú íõäÙóÑõæäó</div><br>  (no profit will it be to those who disbelieve if they (then) believe!

This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ÑõÓõáõåõã ÈöÇáúÈóíøöäóÜÊö İóÑöÍõæÇú ÈöãóÇ ÚöäÏóåõãú ãøöäó ÇáúÚöáúãö</div><br>  (Then when their Messengers came to them with clear proofs, they were glad with that which they had of the knowledge...) (40:83-85) Those who claim that this refers to the conquest of Makkah go too far, and have made a grievous mistake, for on the day of the conquest of Makkah, the Messenger of Allah accepted the Islam of the freed Makkan prisoners-of-war, who numbered nearly two thousand. If what was meant by this Ayah was the conquest of Makkah, he would not have accepted their Islam, because Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íóæúãó ÇáúİóÊúÍö áÇó íóäİóÚõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÅöíóãóÜäõåõãú æóáÇó åõãú íõäÙóÑõæäó </div><br>  (Say: "On the Day of Al-Fath, no profit will it be to those who disbelieve if they (then) believe! Nor will they be granted a respite.'') What is meant by Al-Fath here is Judgement, as in the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇİúÊóÍú Èóíúäöì æóÈóíúäóåõãú İóÊúÍÇğ</div><br>  (Nuh said: So Aftah (judge) between me and them) (26:118). and:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íóÌúãóÚõ ÈóíúäóäóÇ ÑóÈøõäóÇ Ëõãøó íóİúÊóÍõ ÈóíúäóäóÇ ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (Say: "Our Lord will assemble us all together, then He will judge between us with truth'') (34:26).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúÊóİúÊóÍõæÇú æóÎóÇÈó ßõáøõ ÌóÈøóÇÑò ÚóäöíÏò </div><br>  (And they sought judgement and every obstinate, arrogant dictator was brought to a complete loss and destruction. ) (14:15)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäõæÇú ãöä ŞóÈúáõ íóÓúÊóİúÊöÍõæäó Úóáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (although aforetime they had invoked Allah to pass judgement over those who disbelieved) (2:89)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊóÓúÊóİúÊöÍõæÇú İóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßõãõ ÇáúİóÊúÍõ</div><br>  (If you ask for a judgement, now has the judgement come unto you) (8:19). Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÚúÑöÖú Úóäúåõãú æóÇäÊóÙöÑú Åöäøóåõãú ãøõäÊóÙöÑõæäó </div><br>  (So turn aside from them and await, verily, they (too) are awaiting.) meaning, `turn away from these idolators, and convey that which has been revealed to you from your Lord.' This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÊøóÈöÚú ãóÂ ÃõæÍöìó Åöáóíúßó ãöä ÑøóÈøößó áÇ ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó</div><br>  (Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, there is no God but Him.) (6:106) `Wait until Allah fulfills that which He has promised you, and grants you victory over those who oppose you, for He never breaks His promise.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóäúåõãú æóÇäÊóÙöÑú</div><br>  (verily, they (too) are awaiting.) means, `you are waiting, and they are waiting and plotting against you,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú íóŞõæáõæäó ÔóÇÚöÑñ äøóÊóÑóÈøóÕõ Èöåö ÑóíúÈó Çáúãóäõæäö </div><br>  (Or do they say: "A poet! We await for him some calamity by time!'') (52:30). `You will see the consequences of your patience towards them, and the fulfillment of the promise of your Lord in your victory over them, and they will see the consequences of their wait for something bad to befall you and your Companions, in that Allah's punishment will come upon them.' Sufficient unto us is Allah, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat As-Sajdah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
