By the same token, an adopted child does not become the son of the man who adopts him and calls him his son. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ ÌóÚóáó Çááøóåõ áöÑóÌõáò ãøöä ŞóáúÈóíúäö İöì Ìóæúİöåö æóãóÇ ÌóÚóáó ÃóÒúæóÌóßõãõ ÇááÇøóÆöì ÊõÙóÜåöÑõæäó ãöäúåõäøó ÃõãøóåóÜÊößõãú</div><br>  (Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his body. Neither has He made your wives whom you declare to be like your mothers' backs, your real mothers...) This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ åõäøó ÃõãøóåóÜÊöåöãú Åöäú ÃõãøóåóÜÊõåõãú ÅöáÇøó ÇááÇøóÆöì æóáóÏúäóåõãú</div><br>  (They cannot be their mothers.

This was revealed concerning Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, the freed servant of the Prophet . The Prophet had adopted him before prophethood, and he was known as Zayd bin Muhammad. Allah wanted to put an end to this naming and attribution, as He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÌóÚóáó ÃóÏúÚöíóÂÁóßõãú ÃóÈúäóÂÁóßõãú</div><br>  (nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. ) This is similar to the Ayah later in this Surah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ ßóÇäó ãõÍóãøóÏñ ÃóÈóÂ ÃóÍóÏò ãøä ÑøöÌóÇáößõãú æóáóÜßöä ÑøóÓõæáó Çááøóåö æóÎóÇÊóãó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ Èößõáøö ÔóìúÁò ÚóáöíãÇğ </div><br>  (Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the Prophets. And Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything.) (33:40). And Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößõãú Şóæúáõßõã ÈöÃóİúæóåößõãú</div><br>  (That is but your saying with your mouths.) meaning, `your adoption of him is just words, and it does not mean that he is really your son,' for he was created from the loins of another man, and a child cannot have two fathers just as a man cannot have two hearts in one body.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóŞõæáõ ÇáúÍóŞøó æóåõæó íóåúÏöì ÇáÓøóÈöíáó</div><br>  (But Allah says the truth, and He guides to the way.) Sa`id bin Jubayr said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõ ÇáúÍóŞøó</div><br>  (But Allah says the truth,) means, justice. Qatadah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó íóåúÏöì ÇáÓøóÈöíáó</div><br>  (and He guides to the way) means, the straight path. Imam Ahmad said that Hasan told them that Zuhayr told them from Qabus, meaning Ibn Abi Zibyan, that his father told him: "I said to Ibn `Abbas, `Do you know the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ ÌóÚóáó Çááøóåõ áöÑóÌõáò ãøöä ŞóáúÈóíúäö İöì Ìóæúİöåö</div><br>  (Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his body.) What does this mean' He said that the Messenger of Allah stood up one day to pray, and he trembled. The hypocrites who were praying with him said, `Do you not see that he has two hearts, one heart with you and another with them' Then Allah revealed the words:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ ÌóÚóáó Çááøóåõ áöÑóÌõáò ãøöä ŞóáúÈóíúäö İöì Ìóæúİöåö</div><br>  (Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his body.)'' This was also narrated by At-Tirmidhi, who said, "It is a Hasan Hadith''. It was also narrated by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from the Hadith of Zuhayr. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>An Adopted Child should be named after His Real Father</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúÚõæåõãú áÇøğÈóÂÆöåöãú åõæó ÃóŞúÓóØõ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Call them (adopted sons) by their fathers, that is more just with Allah.) This is a command which abrogates the state of affairs that existed at the beginning of Islam, when it was permitted to call adopted sons after the man who adopted them. Then Allah commanded that they should be given back the names of their real fathers, and states that this was more fair and just. Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said: "Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, the freed servant of the Messenger of Allah , was always called Zayd bin Muhammad, until (the words of the) Qur'an were revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúÚõæåõãú áÇøğÈóÂÆöåöãú åõæó ÃóŞúÓóØõ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah.)'' This was also narrated by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. They used to deal with them as sons in every respect, including being alone with them as Mahrams and so on. Hence Sahlah bint Suhayl, the wife of Abu Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with them both, said: "O Messenger of Allah! We used to call Salim our son, but Allah has revealed what He has revealed. He used to enter upon me, but I feel that Abu Hudhayfah does not like that. The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÑúÖöÚöíåö ÊóÍúÑõãöí Úóáóíúå»</div><br>  (Breastfeed him and he will become your Mahram. )'' Hence when this ruling was abrogated, Allah made it permissible for a man to marry the ex-wife of his adopted son, and the Messenger of Allah married Zaynab bint Jahsh, the divorced wife of Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áößóìú áÇó íóßõæäó Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÍóÑóÌñ İöì ÃóÒúæóÇÌö ÃóÏúÚöíóÂÆöåöãú ÅöĞóÇ ŞóÖóæúÇú ãöäúåõäøó æóØóÑÇğ</div><br>  (So that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them) (33:37). And Allah says in Ayat At-Tahrim:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍóáóÜÆöáõ ÃóÈúäóÂÆößõãõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ãöäú ÃóÕúáóÜÈößõãú</div><br>  (The wives of your sons from your own loins) (4:23). The wife of an adopted son is not included because he was not born from the man's loins. A "foster'' son through breastfeeding is the same as a son born from one's own loins, from the point of view of Shari`ah, because the Prophet said in the Two Sahihs:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÍóÑøóãõæÇ ãöäó ÇáÑøóÖóÇÚóÉö ãóÇ íõÍóÑøóãõ ãöäó ÇáäøóÓóÈ»</div><br>  (Suckling makes unlawful as lineage does.) As for calling a person "son'' as an expression of honor and endearment, this is not what is forbidden in this Ayah, as is indicated by the report recorded by Imam Ahmad and the Sunan compilers -- apart from At-Tirmidhi -- from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: "We young boys of Banu `Abd Al-Muttalib came to the Messenger of Allah at the Jamarat; he slapped us on the thigh and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«(ÃõÈóíúäöíøó) áóÇ ÊóÑúãõæÇ ÇáúÌóãúÑóÉó ÍóÊøóì ÊóØúáõÚó ÇáÔøóãúÓ»</div><br>  (O my sons, do not stone the Jamarah until the sun has risen.) This was during the Farewell Pilgrimage in 10 AH.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúÚõæåõãú áÇøğÈóÂÆöåöãú</div><br>  (Call them by their fathers.) This is concerning Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him. He was killed in 8 AH at the battle of Mu'tah. In Sahih Muslim it is reported that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇÈóäöí»</div><br>  (O my son.)'' It was also reported by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä áøóãú ÊóÚúáóãõæÇú ÁóÇÈóÇÁóåõãú İóÅöÎæóÇäõßõãú İöì ÇáÏøöíäö æóãóæóáöíßõãú</div><br>  (But if you know not their father's then they are your brothers in the religion and Mawalikum (your freed servants).) Here Allah commands that adopted sons should be given back their fathers' names, if they are known; if they are not known, then they should be called brothers in faith or freed servants, to compensate for not knowing what their real lineage is. When the Messenger of Allah left Makkah after performing his `Umrat Al-Qada', the daughter of Hamzah, may Allah be pleased with her, started following him, calling, "O uncle, O uncle!'' `Ali took her and said to Fatimah, may Allah be pleased with her, "Take care of your uncle's daughter,'' so she picked her up. `Ali, Zayd and Ja`far -- may Allah be pleased with them -- disputed over of which of them was going to take care of her, and each of them gave his reasons. `Ali said, "I have more right, because she is the daughter of my paternal uncle.'' Zayd said, "She is the daughter of my brother.'' Ja`far bin Abi Talib said: "She is the daughter of my paternal uncle and I am married to her maternal aunt -- meaning Asma' bint `Umays.'' The Prophet ruled that she should stay with her maternal aunt, and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÎóÇáóÉõ ÈöãóäúÒöáóÉö ÇáúÃõã»</div><br>  (The maternal aunt has the same status as the mother.) He said to `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÊó ãöäøöí æóÃóäóÇ ãöäúß»</div><br>  (You belong to me and I belong to you.) He said to Ja`far, may Allah be pleased with him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÔúÈóåúÊó ÎóáúŞöí æóÎõáõŞöí»</div><br>  (You resemble me both in your looks and in your attitude.) And he said to Zayd, may Allah be pleased with him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÊó ÃóÎõæäóÇ æóãóæúáóÇäóÇ»</div><br>  (You are our brother and our freed servant.) This Hadith contains a number of rulings, the most important of which is that the Prophet ruled according to the truth, and that he sought to appease all the disputing parties. His saying to Zayd, may Allah be pleased with him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÊó ÃóÎõæäóÇ æóãóæúáóÇäóÇ»</div><br>  (You are our brother and our freed servant.) is as Allah says in this Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöÎæóÇäõßõãú İöì ÇáÏøöíäö æóãóæóáöíßõãú</div><br>  (your brothers in faith and your freed servants. ) Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóíúÓó Úóáóíúßõãú ÌõäóÇÍñ İöíãóÂ ÃóÎúØóÃúÊõãú Èöåö</div><br>  (And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake,) meaning, if you call one of them after someone who is not in fact his father, by mistake, after trying your best to find out his parentage, then Allah will not attach any sin to this mistake. This is like the Ayah in which Allah commands His servants to say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÇ áÇó ÊõÄóÇÎöĞúäóÂ Åöä äøóÓöíäóÂ Ãóæú ÃóÎúØóÃúäóÇ</div><br>  (Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error) (2:286). It was reported in Sahih Muslim that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÇáó Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó: ŞóÏú İóÚóáúÊ»</div><br>  (Allah says, "Certainly I did (so).'') In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it was recorded that `Amr bin Al-`As, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÇÌúÊóåóÏó ÇáúÍóÇßöãõ İóÃóÕóÇÈó İóáóåõ ÃóÌúÑóÇäö¡ æóÅöäö ÇÌúÊóåóÏó İóÃóÎúØóÃó İóáóåõ ÃóÌúÑ»</div><br>  (If the judge makes Ijtihad and reaches the right decision, he will have two rewards; if he makes Ijtihad and reaches the wrong decision, he will have one reward.) In another Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáì ÑóİóÚó Úóäú ÃõãøóÊöí ÇáúÎóØóÃó æóÇáäøöÓúíóÇäó æóãóÇ íõßúÑóåõæäó Úóáóíúå»</div><br>  (Allah will forgive my Ummah for mistakes, forgetfulness and what they are forced to do.) And Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóíúÓó Úóáóíúßõãú ÌõäóÇÍñ İöíãóÂ ÃóÎúØóÃúÊõãú Èöåö æóáóÜßöä ãøóÇ ÊóÚóãøóÏóÊú ŞõáõæÈõßõãú æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑÇğ ÑøóÍöíãÇğ</div><br>  (And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) meaning, the sin is on the person who deliberately does something wrong, as Allah says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íõÄóÇÎöĞõßõãõ Çááøóåõ ÈöÇáøóáÛúæö İöì ÃóíúãóÜäößõãú</div><br>  (Allah will not call you to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths) (2:225). Imam Ahmad narrated from Ibn `Abbas that `Umar said: "Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed to him the Book. One of the things that was revealed in it was the Ayah of stoning, so the Messenger of Allah stoned adulterers and we stoned them after he died.'' Then he said, "We also used to recite, `Do not attribute yourselves to anyone other than your fathers, for this is disbelief, to attribute yourselves to anyone other than your fathers.''' The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊõØúÑõæäöí ßóãóÇ ÃõØúÑöíó ÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäõ ãóÑúíóãó Úóáóíúåö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉõ æóÇáÓøóáóÇãõ¡ İóÅöäøóãóÇ ÃóäóÇ ÚóÈúÏõÇááåö¡ İóŞõæáõæÇ: ÚóÈúÏõåõ æóÑóÓõæáõå»</div><br>  (Do not exaggerate in praising me as `Isa bin Maryam was praised upon him be peace and blessings.
