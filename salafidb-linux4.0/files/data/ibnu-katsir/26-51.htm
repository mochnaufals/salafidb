Then Fir`awn said to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÁóÇãóäÊõãú áóåõ ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú ÁóÇĞóäó áóßõãú</div><br>  (You have believed in him before I give you leave.) meaning, `you should have asked my permission for what you did, and you did not consult with me; if I had given you permission you could have done it, and if I did not allow you, you should not have done it, for I am the ruler and the one to be obeyed.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ áóßóÈöíÑõßõãõ ÇáøóĞöì Úóáøóãóßõãõ ÇáÓøöÍúÑó</div><br>  (Surely, he indeed is your chief, who has taught you magic!) This is stubborn talk, and anyone can see that it is nonsense, for they had never met Musa before that day, so how could he have been their chief who taught them how to do magic No rational person would say this. Then Fir`awn threatened to cut off their hands and feet, and crucify them. They said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÖóíúÑó</div><br>  (No harm!) meaning, `no problem, that will not harm us and we do not care.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ Åöáóì ÑóÈøöäóÇ ãõäŞóáöÈõæäó</div><br>  (Surely, to our Lord we are to return.) means, `the return of us all is to Allah, may He be glorified, and He will never allow the reward of anyone who has done good to be lost. What you have done to us is not hidden from Him, and He will reward us in full for that.'
