It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Ibn Mas`ud said, "I asked the Prophet , `Which deed is the dearest (to Allah)' He replied:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÕøóáóÇÉõ Úóáì æóŞúÊöåÇ»</div><br>  (To offer the prayers at their fixed times.)

I again asked, `What is the next (in goodness)' He replied:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈöÑøõ ÇáúæóÇáöÏóíúä»</div><br>  (To be good and dutiful to your parents.) `Abdullah then added, "The Prophet told me these words, and had I asked more, the Prophet would have told me more.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Middle Prayer</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Furthermore, Allah has specifically mentioned the Middle prayer, which is the `Asr prayer according to the majority of the scholars among the Companions, as At-Tirmidhi and Al-Baghawi have stated. Al-Qadi Al-Mawardi added that the majority of the scholars of the Tabi`in also held this view. Al-Hafiz Abu `Umar bin `Abdul-Barr said that this is also the opinion of the majority of the scholars of the Athar (i.e., the Hadith and the statements of the Salaf). In addition, Abu Muhammad bin `Atiyah said that this is the Tafsir (of the Middle prayer) of the majority of scholars. Al-Hafiz Abu Muhammad `Abdul-Mu'min bin Khalaf Ad-Dumyati stated in his book on the Middle prayer that it is the `Asr prayer and mentioned that this is the Tafsir of `Umar, `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, Abu Ayyub, `Abdullah bin `Amr, Samurah bin Jundub, Abu Hurayrah, Abu Sa`id, Hafsah, Umm Habibah, Umm Salamah, Ibn `Abbas and `A'ishah. This is also the Tafsir of `Ubaydah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Razin, Zirr bin Hubaysh, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ibn Sirin, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Kalbi, Muqatil, `Ubayd bin Abu Maryam, and others. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Proof that the `Asr Prayer is the Middle Prayer</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad reported that `Ali narrated that Allah's Messenger said during the battle of Al-Ahzab (the Confederates):   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÔóÛóáõæäóÇ Úóäö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö ÇáúæõÓúØóì¡ ÕóáóÇÉö ÇáúÚóÕúÑö¡ ãóáóÃó Çááåõ ŞõáõæÈóåõã æóÈõíõæÊóåã äóÇÑğÇ»</div><br>  (They (the disbelievers) busied us from performing the Middle prayer, the `Ar prayer, may Allah fill their hearts and houses with fire.)  He performed the `Asr prayer between Maghrib and `Isha'. Muslim and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith. In addition, the Two Shaykhs, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi An-Nasa'i and several other collectors of the Sunan recorded this Hadith using different chains of narrators to `Ali. The Hadith about the battle of Al-Ahzab, when the Mushriks prevented Allah's Messenger and his Companions from performing the `Asr prayer, has been narrated by several other Companions. We only mentioned the narrations that stated that the Middle prayer is the `Asr prayer. Furthermore, Muslim reported similar wordings for this Hadith from Ibn Mas`ud and Al-Bara' bin `Azib.  In addition, Imam Ahmad reported that Samurah bin Jundub said that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúæÓúØóì ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúÚóÕúÑ»</div><br>  (The Middle prayer is the `Asr prayer.)  In another narration, Allah's Messenger mentioned:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÜİöÙõæÇú Úóáóì ÇáÕøóáóæóÊö æÇáÕøóáóæÉö ÇáúæõÓúØóì</div><br>  (Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawat (the prayers) especially the Middle Salah) and stated that it is the `Asr prayer. In another narration, Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åöíó ÇáúÚóÕúÑ»</div><br>  (It is the `Asr prayer.) and Ibn Ja`far mentioned that the Prophet was then being asked about the Middle prayer. At-Tirmidhi reported this Hadith and said, "Hasan, Sahih." In addition, Abu Hatim bin Hibban reported in his Sahih that `Abdullah said that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúæÓúØóì ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúÚóÕúÑ»</div><br>  (The Middle prayer is the `Asr prayer.)  At-Tirmidhi reported that Ibn Mas`ud narrated that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúæÓúØóì ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúÚóÕúÑ»</div><br>  (The `Asr prayer is the Middle prayer.)  At-Tirmidhi then stated that this Hadith is of a Hasan, Sahih type. Muslim reported the Hadith in his Sahih and his wordings are:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÔóÛóáõæäóÇ Úóäö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö ÇáúæÓúØóì ÕóáóÇÉö ÇáúÚóÕúÑ»</div><br>  (They (disbelievers) busied us from performing the Middle prayer, the `Asr prayer.)  These texts emphasize the fact (that the `Asr prayer is the Middle prayer). What further proves this fact is that, in an authentic Hadith, Allah's Messenger emphasized the necessity of preserving the `Asr prayer, when he said, as Ibn `Umar narrated:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú İóÇÊóÊúåõ ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúÚóÕúÑö İóßóÃóäøóãóÇ æõÊöÑó Ãóåúáóåõ æóãóÇáóå»</div><br>  (Whoever misses the `Asr prayer will be like who has lost his family and money.)  It is reported in the Sahih that Buraydah bin Al-Husayb said that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóßøöÑõæÇ ÈöÇáÕøóáóÇÉö İöí íóæúãö ÇáúÛóíúãö¡ İóÅöäøóåõ ãóäú ÊóÑóßó ÕóáóÇÉó ÇáúÚóÕúÑö¡ İóŞóÏú ÍóÈöØó Úóãóáõå»</div><br>  (On a cloudy day, perform the (`Asr) prayer early, for whoever misses the `Asr prayer, will have his (good) deeds annulled.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Prohibition of speaking during the Prayer</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõæãõæÇú áöáøóåö ŞóÜäöÊöíäó</div><br>  (And stand before Allah with obedience.) meaning, with humbleness and humility before Him (i.e., during the prayer). This command indicates that it is not allowed to speak during the prayer, as speaking contradicts the nature of the prayer. This is why the Prophet refused to answer Ibn Mas`ud when he greeted him while he was praying and said afterwards:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó İöí ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö áóÔõÛúáğÇ»</div><br>  (The prayer makes one sufficiently busy.) (i.e., by the various actions of the body, tongue and heart involved during the prayer.)  Muslim reported that the Prophet said to Mu`awiyah bin Hakam As-Sulami when he spoke during the prayer:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó åĞöåö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó áóÇ íóÕúáõÍõ İöíåóÇ ÔóíúÁñ ãöäú ßóáóÇãö ÇáäøóÇÓö¡ ÅäøóãóÇ åöí ÇáÊøóÓúÈöíÍõ æóÇáÊøóßúÈöíÑõ æóĞößúÑõ Çááå»</div><br>  (The ordinary speech people indulge in is not appropriate during the prayer. The prayer involves only Tasbih (praising Allah), Takbir (saying Allahu Akbar, i.e., Allah is the Most Great) and remembering Allah.)  Imam Ahmad reported that Zayd bin Arqam said, "One used to address his friend about various affairs during the prayer. Then when this Ayah was revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõæãõæÇú áöáøóåö ŞóÜäöÊöíäó</div><br>  (And stand before Allah with obedience.) we were ordered to refrain from speaking.'' The Group (i. e., the Hadith collections), except Ibn Majah, reported this Hadith. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Fear Prayer</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅäú ÎöİúÊõãú İóÑöÌóÇáÇğ Ãóæú ÑõßúÈóÇäğÇ İóÅöĞóÂ ÃóãöäÊõãú İóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú Çááøóåó ßóãóÇ Úóáøóãóßõã ãøóÇ áóãú ÊóßõæäõæÇú ÊóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (And if you fear (an enemy), (perform Salah) on foot or riding. And when you are in safety, then remember Allah (pray) in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before).)  After Allah commanded His servants to perform the prayer perfectly and emphasized this commandment, He mentioned the situation where the person might not be able to perform the prayer perfectly, during battle and combat. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅäú ÎöİúÊõãú İóÑöÌóÇáÇğ Ãóæú ÑõßúÈóÇäğÇ</div><br>  (And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salah on foot or riding.) meaning, pray in the appropriate manner under these circumstances, whether on foot or riding and whether facing the Qiblah or otherwise. Imam Malik reported that Nafi` related that Ibn `Umar used to describe the Fear prayer when he was asked about it and would then add, "If there is intense fear, pray on foot, riding, facing the Qiblah and otherwise.'' Nafi` commented, "I think that he related that to the Prophet .'' Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported the Hadith.  Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "Allah has ordained the prayer by the words of your Prophet : four (Rak`ah) while residing, two Rak`ah while traveling and one Rak`ah during times of fear.'' This is also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, and others.  In addition, Al-Bukhari has entitled a Chapter: `Prayer while confronting the Forts and facing the Enemy'. Al-Awza`i said, "If the victory seems near and the Muslims are unable to perform the prayer (in the normal manner), they should pray by nodding each by himself. If they are unable to nod, they should delay the prayer until fighting is finished. When they feel safe, they should pray two Rak`ah. If they are unable, they should then pray one Rak`ah that includes two prostrations. If they are unable, then Takbir alone does not suffice, so they should delay the prayer until they are safe.'' This is the same view that Makhul held. Anas bin Malik said, "I participated in the attack on the fort of Tastar, when the light of dawn started to become clear. Suddenly, the fighting raged and the Muslims were unable to pray until the light of day spread. We then prayed (the Dawn prayer) with Abu Musa and we became victorious. I would not have been pleased if I were to gain in the life of this world and whatever is in it instead of that prayer.'' This is the wording of Al-Bukhari. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Prayer during the Times of Peace is performed normally</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÂ ÃóãöäÊõãú İóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú Çááøóåó</div><br>  (And when you are in safety, then remember Allah (pray)) meaning, `Perform the prayer as I have commanded you by completing its bowing, prostration, standing, sitting, and with the required attention (in the heart) and supplication.' Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóãóÇ Úóáøóãóßõã ãøóÇ áóãú ÊóßõæäõæÇú ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before).) meaning, just as He has endowed you, guided you and taught you about what benefits you in this life and the Hereafter, so thank and remember Him. Similarly, Allah said after He mentioned the prayer of Fear,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ÇØúãóÃúäóäÊõãú İóÃóŞöíãõæÇú ÇáÕøóáóæÉó Åöäøó ÇáÕøóáóæÉó ßóÇäóÊú Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ßöÊóÜÈÇğ ãøóæúŞõæÊÇğ</div><br>  (...but when you are free from danger, perform As-Salah. Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.) (4:103)  We will mention the Hadiths about the prayer of Fear and its description in Surat An-Nisa' while mentioning Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ßõäÊó İöíåöãú İóÃóŞóãúÊó áóåõãõ ÇáÕøóáóæÉó</div><br>  (When you (O Messenger Muhammad ) are among them, and lead them in As-Salah (the prayer).)
