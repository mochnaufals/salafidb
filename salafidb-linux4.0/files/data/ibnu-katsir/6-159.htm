Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas commented,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó İóÑøóŞõæÇú Ïöíäóåõãú æóßóÇäõæÇú ÔöíóÚğÇ</div><br>  (Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects...) "Before Muhammad was sent, the Jews and Christians disputed and divided into sects. When Muhammad was sent, Allah revealed to him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó İóÑøóŞõæÇú Ïöíäóåõãú æóßóÇäõæÇú ÔöíóÚğÇ áøóÓúÊó ãöäúåõãú İöì ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects, you have no concern with them in the least.) It is apparent that this Ayah refers to all those who defy the religion of Allah, or revert from it. Allah sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth so that He makes it victorious and dominant above all religions. His Law is one and does not contain any contradiction or incongruity. Therefore, those who dispute in the religion,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäõæÇú ÔöíóÚÇğ</div><br>  (...and break up into sects,) religious sects, just like those who follow the various sects, desires and misguidance - then Allah has purified His Messenger from their ways. In a similar Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÔóÑóÚó áóßõã ãøöäó ÇáöÏöíäö ãóÇ æóÕøóì Èöåö äõæÍÇğ æóÇáøóĞöì ÃóæúÍóíúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó</div><br>  (He (Allah) has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh, and that which We have revealed to you.)42:13 A Hadith reads,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÍúäõ ãóÚóÇÔöÑõ ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁö ÃóæúáóÇÏõ ÚóáøóÇÊò ÏöíäõäóÇ æóÇÍöÏ»</div><br>  (We, the Prophets, are half brothers but have one religion.) This, indeed, is the straight path which the Messengers have brought and which commands worshipping Allah alone without partners and adhering to the Law of the last Messenger whom Allah sent. All other paths are types of misguidance, ignorance, sheer opinion and desires; and as such, the Messengers are free from them. Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóÓúÊó ãöäúåõãú İöì ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (You have no concern with them in the least...) 6:159.
