And they belied them wrongfully and arrogantly, though they themselves were convinced thereof. So, see what was the end of the mischief-makers.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Story of Musa and the End of Fir`awn</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Here Allah tells His Messenger Muhammad about what happened to Musa, peace be upon him, how Allah chose him, spoke with him and gave him mighty, dazzling signs and overwhelming proof, and sent him to Fir`awn and his people, but they denied the proof, disbelieved in him and arrogantly refused to follow him. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ŞóÇáó ãõæÓóì áÇøğåúáöåö</div><br>  (when Musa said to his household), meaning, remember when Musa was traveling with his family and lost his way. This was at night, in the dark. Musa had seen a fire beside the mountain, i.e., he had noticed a fire burning brightly, and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøğåúáöåö Åöäøöì ÂäóÓúÊõ äóÇÑÇğ ÓóÜóÇÊöíßõãú ãøöäúåóÇ ÈöÎóÈóÑò</div><br>  (to his household: "Verily, I have seen a fire; I will bring you from there some information...'') meaning, `about the way we should take.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÁóÇÊöíßõãú ÈöÔöåóÇÈò ŞóÈóÓò áøóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÕúØóáõæäó</div><br>  (or I will bring you a burning ember, that you may warm yourselves.) meaning, so that they could keep warm. And it was as he said: "He came back with great news, and a great light.'' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁóåóÇ äõæÏöìó Ãóä ÈõæÑößó ãóä İöì ÇáäøóÇÑö æóãóäú ÍóæúáóåóÇ</div><br>  (But when he came to it, he was called: "Blessed is whosoever is in the fire, and whosoever is round about it!'') meaning, when he came to it, he saw a great and terrifying sight: the fire was burning in a green bush, and the fire was burning ever brighter while the bush was growing ever more green and beautiful. Then he raised his head, and saw that its light was connected to the clouds of the sky. Ibn `Abbas and others said, "It was not a fire, rather it was shining light.'' According to one report narrated from Ibn `Abbas, it was the Light of the Lord of the worlds. Musa stood amazed by what he was seeing, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äõæÏöìó Ãóä ÈõæÑößó ãóä İöì ÇáäøóÇÑö</div><br>  (he was called: "Blessed is whosoever is in the fire...'') Ibn `Abbas said, "This means, Holy is (whosoever is in the fire).''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäú ÍóæúáóåóÇ</div><br>  (and whosoever is round about it) means, of the angels. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan and Qatadah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓõÈúÍóÜäó Çááøóåö ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (And glorified be Allah, the Lord of all that exists), Who does whatever He wills and there is nothing like Him among His creation. Nothing He has made can encompass Him, and He is the Exalted, the Almighty, Who is utterly unlike all that He has created. Heaven and earth cannot contain Him, but He is the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who is far above any comparison with His creation.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íãõæÓóì Åöäøóåõ ÃóäóÇ Çááøóåõ ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÍóßöíãõ </div><br>  (O Musa! Verily, it is I, Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.) Allah told him that the One Who was addressing him was his Lord Allah, the All-Mighty, Who has subjugated and subdued all things, the One Who is Wise in all His words and deeds. Then He commanded him to throw down the stick that was in his hand, so that He might show him clear proof that He is the One Who is able to do all things, whatever He wills. When Musa threw that stick down, it changed into the form of a huge and terrifying snake, moving quickly despite its size. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÁóÇåóÇ ÊóåúÊóÒøõ ßóÃóäøóåóÇ ÌóÂäøñ</div><br>  (But when he saw it moving as if it were a Jann (snake).) Jann refers to a type of snake that is the fastest-moving and most agile. When Musa saw that with his own eyes,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáøóì ãõÏúÈöÑÇğ æóáóãú íõÚóŞøöÈú</div><br>  (he turned in flight, and did not look back.) meaning, he did not turn around, because he was so afraid. Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íãõæÓóì áÇó ÊóÎóİú Åöäøöì áÇó íóÎóÇİõ áóÏóìøó ÇáúãõÑúÓóáõæäó</div><br>  (O Musa! Fear not: verily, the Messengers fear not in front of Me.) means, `do not be afraid of what you see, for I want to choose you as a Messenger and make you a great Prophet.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅóáÇøó ãóä Ùóáóãó Ëõãøó ÈóÏøóáó ÍõÓúäÇğ ÈóÚúÏó ÓõæÁò İóÅöäøöì ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (Except him who has done wrong and afterwards has changed evil for good; then surely, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This is an exception of the exclusionary type. This is good news for mankind, for whoever does an evil deed then gives it up and repents and turns to Allah, Allah will accept his repentance, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøöì áóÛóİøóÇÑñ áøöãóä ÊóÇÈó æóÂãóäó æóÚóãöáó ÕóÜáöÍóÇğ Ëõãøó ÇåúÊóÏóì </div><br>  (And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes and does righteous good deeds, and then Ahtada.) (20:82)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÚúãóáú ÓõæÁÇğ Ãóæú íóÙúáöãú äóİúÓóåõ</div><br>  (And whoever does evil or wrongs himself...) (4:110). And there are many other Ayat which say the same.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÏúÎöáú íóÏóßó İöì ÌóíúÈößó ÊóÎúÑõÌú ÈóíúÖóÂÁó ãöäú ÛóíúÑö ÓõæÁò</div><br>  (And put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without hurt.) This is another sign, further brilliant proof of the ability of Allah to do whatever He wills. It is also confirmation of the truth of the one to whom the miracle was given. Allah commanded him to put his hand into the opening of his garment, and when he put his hand in and took it out again, it came out white and shining as if it were a piece of the moon or a flash of dazzling lightning.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÊöÓúÚö ÁóÇíóÜÊò</div><br>  (among the nine signs) means, `these are two of the nine signs which you will be supported with and which will serve as proof for you. '   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì İöÑúÚóæúäó æóŞóæúãöåö Åöäøóåõãú ßóÇäõæÇú ŞóæúãÇğ İóÜÓöŞöíäó</div><br>  (to Fir`awn and his people. Verily, they are a people who are rebellious.) These were the nine signs of which Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÁóÇÊóíúäóÇ ãõæÓóì ÊöÓúÚó ÁóÇíóÜÊò ÈóíøöäóÇÊò</div><br>  (And indeed We gave Musa nine clear signs) (17:101) -- as we have stated there.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ÁóÇíóÜÊõäóÇ ãõÈúÕöÑóÉğ</div><br>  (But when Our Ayat came to them, clear to see,), i.e., clear and obvious,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú åóÜĞóÇ ÓöÍúÑñ ãøõÈöíäñ</div><br>  (they said: "This is a manifest magic''.) They wanted to oppose it with their own magic, but they were defeated and were returned disgraced.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÍóÏõæÇú ÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (And they belied them) means, verbally,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúÊóíúŞóäóÊúåóÂ ÃóäİõÓõåõãú</div><br>  (though they themselves were convinced thereof.) means, they knew deep down that this was truth from Allah, but they denied it and were stubborn and arrogant.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÙõáúãÇğ æóÚõáõæøÇğ</div><br>  (wrongfully and arrogantly) means, wronging themselves because this was the despicable manner to which they were accustomed, and they were arrogant because they were too proud to follow the truth. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇäÙõÑú ßóíúİó ßóÇäó ÚóÜŞöÈóÉõ ÇáúãõİúÓöÏöíäó</div><br>  (So, see what was the end of the mischief-makers.) meaning, `see, O Muhammad, what were the consequences of their actions when Allah destroyed them and drowned every last one of them in a single morning.' The point of this story is: beware, `O you who disbelieve in Muhammad and deny the Message that he has brought from his Lord, lest the same thing that befell them befall you also.' But what is worse, is that Muhammad is nobler and greater than Musa, and his proof is stronger than that of Musa, for the signs that Allah has given him are combined with his presence and his character, in addition to the fact that previous Prophets foretold his coming and took a covenant from the people that they would follow him if they should see him, may the best of blessings and peace from his Lord be upon him.  </div></body></html>
