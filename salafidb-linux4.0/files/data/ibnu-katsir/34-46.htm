This meaning was stated by Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b, As-Suddi, Qatadah and others. This is what is meant by the Ayah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäú åõæó ÅöáÇøó äóĞöíÑñ áøóßõãú Èóíúäó íóÏóìú ÚóĞóÇÈò ÔóÏöíÏò</div><br>  (He is only a warner to you in face of a severe torment.) Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on this Ayah: "One day, the Prophet climbed up As-Safa' and shouted,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÕóÈóÇÍóÇå»</div><br>  (O people!) The Quraysh gathered around him, and said, `What is the matter with you' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÑóÃóíúÊõãú áóæú ÃóÎúÈóÑúÊõßõãú Ãóäøó ÇáúÚóÏõæøó íõÕóÈøöÍõßõãú Ãóæú íõãóÓøöíßõãú ÃóãóÇ ßõäúÊõãú ÊõÕóÏøöŞõæäøöí»</div><br>  (What do you think If I told you that the enemy were approaching and will reach us in the morning or in the evening, would you believe me) They said, `Of course.'
