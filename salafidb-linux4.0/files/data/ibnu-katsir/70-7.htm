It is as though it is saying, a questioner requested to hasten on the torment that is about to fall. It is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõæäóßó ÈöÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö æóáóä íõÎúáöİó Çááøóåõ æóÚúÏóåõ</div><br>  (And they ask you to hasten on the torment!

Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÃóáó ÓóÂÆöáñ ÈöÚóĞóÇÈò æóÇŞöÚò </div><br>  (A questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall) "That is the questioning of the disbelievers about the torment of Allah and it will occur to them.'' Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid that he said concerning Allah's statement   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÃóáó ÓóÂÆöáñ</div><br>  (A questioner asked), "A person called out (requesting) for the torment that will occur in the Hereafter to happen.'' Then he said, "This is their saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõãøó Åöä ßóÇäó åóÜĞóÇ åõæó ÇáúÍóŞøó ãöäú ÚöäÏößó İóÃóãúØöÑú ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÍöÌóÇÑóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö Ãóæö ÇÆúÊöäóÇ ÈöÚóĞóÇÈò Ãóáöíãò</div><br>  (O Allah!

(8:32) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇŞöÚòáöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (about to befall (Waqi`) upon the disbelievers,) means, it is waiting in preparation for the disbelievers. Ibn `Abbas said, "Waqi` means coming.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó áóåõ ÏóÇİöÚñ</div><br>  (which non can avert) meaning, there is no one who can repel it if Allah wants it to happen.

Mujahid said, "Lord of the ways of ascent means the ways of ascension into the heavens.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÚúÑõÌõ ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ æóÇáÑøõæÍõ Åöáóíúåö</div><br>  (The angels and the Ruh Ta`ruju to Him) `Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ma`mar from Qatadah that Ta`ruju means to ascend. In reference to the Ruh, Abu Salih said, "They are creatures from the creation of Allah that resemble humans but they are not humans.'' It could be that here it means Jibril, and this is a way of connecting the specific to the general (other angels). It could also be referring to the name of the souls (Arwah) of the Children of Adam (humans). For verily, when they (the human souls) are taken at death, they are lifted up to the heavens just as the Hadith of Al-Bara' proves. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of "a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì íóæúãò ßóÇäó ãöŞúÏóÇÑõåõ ÎóãúÓöíäó Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉò</div><br>  (in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.) This refers to the Day of Judgement. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì íóæúãò ßóÇäó ãöŞúÏóÇÑõåõ ÎóãúÓöíäó Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉò</div><br>  (in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.) "It is the Day of Judgement.'' The chain of narration of this report (to Ibn `Abbas) is authentic. Ath-Thawri reported from Simak bin Harb from `Ikrimah that he said concerning this verse, "It is the Day of Judgement.'' Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd both said the same. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÚúÑõÌõ ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ æóÇáÑøõæÍõ Åöáóíúåö İöì íóæúãò ßóÇäó ãöŞúÏóÇÑõåõ ÎóãúÓöíäó Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉò </div><br>  (The angels and the Ruh ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.) "It is the Day of Judgement that Allah has made to be the measure of fifty thousand years for the disbelievers. '' Many Hadiths have been reported with this same meaning. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu `Umar Al-Ghudani that he said, "I was with Abu Hurayrah when a man from Bani `Amir bin Sa`sa`ah passed and it was said: `This man is the wealthiest man of Bani `Amir.' So Abu Hurayrah said, `Bring him back to me.' So they brought the man back to Abu Hurayrah. Then Abu Hurayrah said, `I have been informed that you are a man of great wealth.' The man from Bani `Amir replied, `Yes, by Allah. I have one hundred red-colored camels, one hundred brown-colored camels...' and so on he counted numerous colored camels, the races of the slaves and the types of fetters for his horses that he owned. So Abu Hurayrah said, `Beware of the hooves of the camels and the cloven hooves of the cattle.' He continued repeating that to him until the color of the man began to change. Then the man said, `O Abu Hurayrah what is this' Abu Hurayrah replied, `I heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ßóÇäóÊú áóåõ ÅöÈöáñ áóÇ íõÚúØöí ÍóŞøóåóÇ İöí äóÌúÏóÊöåóÇ æóÑöÓúáöåóÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever has camels and does not give their due (Zakah) in their Najdah and their Risl...)

Then, the man from Bani `Amir said, `What is the due of the camel, O Abu Hurayrah' Abu Hurayrah said, `It is that you give (in your Zakah payment) from your most valuable camels, that you lend a milking she-camel, that you lend your mount for riding, that you give the milk (to the people) for drinking, and you lend the male camel for breeding.''' This Hadith was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>A Different Version of this Hadith</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú ÕóÇÍöÈö ßóäúÒò áóÇ íõÄóÏøöí ÍóŞøóåõ ÅöáøóÇ ÌõÚöáó ÕóİóÇÆöÍó¡ íõÍúãóì ÚóáóíúåóÇ İöí äóÇÑö Ìóåóäøóãó¡ İóÊõßúæóì ÈöåóÇ ÌóÈúåóÊõåõ æóÌóäúÈõåõ æóÙóåúÑõåõ¡ ÍóÊúì íóÍúßõãó Çááåõ Èóíúäó ÚöÈóÇÏöåö İöí íóæúã ßóÇäó ãöŞúÏóÇÑõåõ ÎóãúÓöíäó Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉò ãöãøóÇ ÊóÚõÏøõæäó¡ Ëõãøó íóÑóì ÓóÈöíáóåõ ÅöãøóÇ Åöáóì ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóÅöãøóÇ Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (There is not any owner of treasure who does not pay its due except that it will be made into heated metal plates and branded upon him in the fire of Hell. His forehead, side and back will be scorched with these metal plates. This will continue until Allah judges between His servants on a Day whose measure is fifty thousand years of what you count. Then he will see his path, either to Paradise or to the Fire.) Then he (Abu Hurayrah) mentions the rest of the Hadith about the sheep and camels just as mentioned before. In this narration (of Ahmad) the Prophet also added,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÎóíúáõ áöËóáóÇËóÉò: áöÑóÌõáò ÃóÌúÑñ¡ æóáöÑóÌõáò ÓöÊúÑñ¡ æóÚóáóì ÑóÌõáò æöÒúÑ»</div><br>  (The horse is for three (on the Day of Judgement): for one man it is a reward, for another man it is a shield (protection), and upon another man it is a burden.) And the Hadith continues. Muslim also recorded this Hadith in its entirety even though Al-Bukhari did not mention it. The intent behind mentioning this here is the Prophet's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÍóÊúì íóÍúßõãó Çááåõ Èóíúäó ÚöÈóÇÏöåö İöí íóæúãò ßóÇäó ãöŞúÏóÇÑõåõ ÎóãúÓöíäó Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉ»</div><br>  (Until Allah judges between His servants on a day whose measurement is fifty thousand years.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Instructing the Prophet to have Patience Then</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÕúÈöÑú ÕóÈúÑÇğ ÌóãöíáÇğ </div><br>  (So be patient, with a good patience.) meaning, `be patient, O Muhammad, with your people's rejection and their seeking to hasten the torment since they think it will not occur.'
