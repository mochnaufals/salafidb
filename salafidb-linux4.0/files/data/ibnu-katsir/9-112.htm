Praising Allah is among the best statements. This is why Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóÜãöÏõæäó</div><br>  (who praise (Him)).

Allah also described the Prophet's wives that they are,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÜÆöÍóÜÊò</div><br>  (Sa'ihat) 66:5, meaning, they fast. As for prostrating and bowing down, they are acts of the prayer,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÑóßöÚõæäó ÇáÓøóÜÌöÏæäó</div><br>  (who bow down, who prostrate themselves,) These believers also benefit Allah's creation and direct them to His obedience by ordaining righteousness and forbidding evil. They have knowledge about what should be performed and what should be shunned. This includes abiding by Allah's limits in knowledge and action, meaning, what He allowed and what He prohibited. Therefore, they worship the True Lord and advise creation. This is why Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóÔøöÑö ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  (And give glad tidings to the believers.) since faith includes all of this, and the supreme success is for those who have faith.  </div></body></html>
