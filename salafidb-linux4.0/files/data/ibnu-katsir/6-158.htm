The day that some of the signs of your Lord do come no good will it do to a person to believe then.)  Before the commencement of the Day of Resurrection, there will come signs and portents of the Last Hour that will be witnessed by the people living at that time. In a section explaining this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóŞõæãõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ÍóÊøóì ÊóØúáõÚó ÇáÔøóãúÓõ ãöäú ãóÛúÑöÈöåóÇ İóÅöĞóÇ ÑóÂåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ Âãóäó ãóäú ÚóáóíúåóÇ İóĞóáößó Íöíä»</div><br>  (The Last Hour will not commence until the sun rises from the west.

Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ËóáóÇËñ ÅöĞóÇ ÎóÑóÌúäó áóÇ íóäúİóÚõ äóİúÓğÇ ÅöíãóÇäõåóÇ áóãú Êóßõäú ÂãóäóÊú ãöäú ŞóÈúá Ãóæú ßóÓóÈóÊú İöí ÅöíãóÇäöåóÇ ÎóíúÑğÇ¡ ØõáõæÚõ ÇáÔøóãúÓö ãöäú ãóÛúÑöÈöåóÇ æóÇáÏøóÌøóÇáõ æóÏóÇÈøóÉõ ÇáúÃóÑúÖ»</div><br>  (Three, if they appear, then a soul will not benefit from its faith, if it had not believed before or earned good in its faith: when the sun rises from the west, Ad-Dajjal and the Beast of the earth.) Ahmad also recorded this Hadith, and in his narration, the Prophet mentioned the Smoke. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Jarir said, "Three Muslim men sat with Marwan in Al-Madinah and they heard him talking about the signs (of the Last Hour). He said that the first sign will be the appearance of Ad-Dajjal. So these men went to `Abdullah bin `Amr and told him what they heard from Marwan about the signs. Ibn `Amr said, Marwan said nothing. I remember that I heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Ãóæøóáó ÇáúÂíÇÊö ÎõÑõæÌğÇ ØõáõæÚõ ÇáÔøóãúÓö ãöäú ãóÛúÑöÈöåóÇ æóÎõÑõæÌõ ÇáÏøóÇÈøóÉö ÖõÍğì İóÃóíøóÊõåõãóÇ ßóÇäóÊú ŞóÈúáó ÕóÇÍöÈóÊöåóÇ İóÇáúÃõÎúÑóì Úóáóì ÃóËóÑöåóÇ»</div><br>  (The first of the signs to appear are the sun rising from the west and the Beast that appears in the early morning. Whichever comes before the other, then the second sign will appear soon after it.'') Then `Abdullah said - and he used to read the Scriptures - "And I think the first of them is the sun rising from the west. That is because when it sets it comes under the Throne, prostrates and seeks permission to return. So it is permitted to return until Allah wants it to rise from the west. So it does as it normally would, it comes beneath the Throne, it prostrates and seeks permission to return. But it will get no response. Then it will seek permission to return again, but it will get no response, until what Allah wills of the night to pass goes by, and it realizes that if it is permitted to return it would not be able to reach the east. It says; `My Lord! The east is so far, what good would I be to the people' Until the horizons appear as a lightless ring, it seeks permission to return and is told; `Rise from your place,' so it rises upon the people from where it set.'' Then he recited,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóäİóÚõ äóİúÓğÇ ÅöíãóÇäõåóÇ áóãú Êóßõäú ÁóÇãóäóÊú ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before,)  This was also recorded by Muslim in his Sahih, and Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah in their Sunans. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóäİóÚõ äóİúÓğÇ ÅöíãóÇäõåóÇ áóãú Êóßõäú ÁóÇãóäóÊú ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before,) means, when the disbeliever believes then, it will not be accepted from him. As for those who were believers before, if they earned righteous deeds, they will have earned a great deal of good. If they had not done good nor repented before then, it will not be accepted from them, according to the Hadiths that we mentioned. This is also the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ßóÓóÈóÊú İöì ÅöíãóÜäöåóÇ ÎóíúÑğÇ</div><br>  (...nor earned good through his faith. ) meaning, one's good deeds will not be accepted from him unless he performed good deeds before. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáö ÇäÊóÙöÑõæÇú ÅöäøóÇ ãõäÊóÙöÑõæäó</div><br>  (Say: "Wait you! We (too) are waiting.") This is a stern threat to the disbelievers and a sure promise for those who delay embracing the faith and repenting until a time when faith or repentance shall not avail. This will occur when the sun rises from the west because the Last Hour will then be imminent and its major signs will have begun to appear. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóáú íóäÙõÑõæäó ÅöáÇøó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉó Ãóä ÊóÃúÊöíóåõãú ÈóÛúÊóÉğ İóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁó ÃóÔúÑóÇØõåóÇ İóÃóäøóì áóåõãú ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ĞößúÑóÇåõãú </div><br>  (Do they then await (anything) other than the Hour, that it should come upon them suddenly But some of its portents have already come; and when it is upon them, how can they benefit then by their reminder) 47:18, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÃóæúÇú ÈóÃúÓóäóÇ ŞóÇáõæÇú ÁóÇãóäøóÇ ÈöÇááøóåö æóÍúÏóåõ æóßóÜİóÑúäóÇ ÈöãóÇ ßõäøóÇ Èöåö ãõÔúÑößöíäó İóáóãú íóßõ íóäİóÚõåõãú ÅöíãóÜäõåõãú áóãøóÇ ÑóÃóæúÇú ÈóÃúÓóäóÇ</div><br>  (So when they saw Our punishment, they said: "We believe in Allah alone and reject (all) that we used to associate with Him as partners."
