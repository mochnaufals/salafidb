However, they did not abide by it, and this is why Allah resembled them to the donkey that carries volumes of books. Surely, when the donkey carries books, it will not understand what these books contain because it is only carrying these books using its strength. This is the example of those who were entrusted with the Tawrah; they read its letter but did not understand its meanings nor abided by them. Rather, they even corrupted and changed the Tawrah. Therefore, they are worse than the donkey, because the donkey cannot understand. They, on the other hand, could have understood using their minds, but their minds were of no benefit. This is why Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ßóÇáÃóäúÚóÜãö Èóáú åõãú ÃóÖóáøõ ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÛóÜİöáõæäó</div><br>  (They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those!

But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent forth before them. And Allah is Aware of the wrongdoers. And verily, you will find them the greediest of mankind for life and (even greedier) than those who ascribe partners to Allah. One of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years. But the grant of such life will not save him even a little from punishment. And Allah is Seer of what they do.) (2:94-96) We explained these meanings there, stating that the challenge was for the Jews to invoke Allah to destroy the misguided group, either they or their enemies. We also mentioned a similar challenge against the Christians in Surah Al `Imran,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóäú ÍóÂÌøóßó İöíåö ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌóÂÁóßó ãöäó ÇáúÚöáúãö İóŞõáú ÊóÚóÇáóæúÇú äóÏúÚõ ÃóÈúäóÂÁóäóÇ æóÃóÈúäóÂÁóßõãú æóäöÓóÂÁóäóÇ æóäöÓóÂÁóßõãú æóÃóäİõÓóäóÇ æÃóäİõÓóßõãú Ëõãøó äóÈúÊóåöáú İóäóÌúÚóá áøóÚúäóÊõ Çááøóåö Úóáóì ÇáúßóÜĞöÈöíäó </div><br>  (Then whoever disputes with you concerning him `Isa after (all this) knowledge that has come to you, say: "Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves -- then we pray and invoke the curse of Allah upon those who lie.'')(3:61) and against the idolators, in Surah Maryam,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ãóä ßóÇäó İöì ÇáÖøóáóÜáóÉö İóáúíóãúÏõÏú áóåõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ ãóÏøÇğ</div><br>  (Say whoever is in error, the Most Gracious will extend circumstances for him.)(19:75) Imam Ahmad, may Allah be pleased with him recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him, said, `If I see Muhammad praying at the Ka`bah, I will step on his neck.' When the Prophet heard of that, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú İóÚóáó áóÃóÎóĞóÊúåõ ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉõ ÚóíóÇäğÇ æóáóæú Ãóäøó ÇáúíóåõæÏó ÊóãóäøóæõÇ ÇáúãóæúÊó áóãóÇÊõæÇ æóÑóÃóæúÇ ãóŞóÇÚöÏóåõãú ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ æóáóæú ÎóÑóÌó ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÈóÇåöáõæäó ÑóÓõæáó ÇááåöÕáì Çááå Úáíå æÓáøã áóÑóÌóÚõæÇ áóÇ íóÌöÏõæäó ÃóåúáğÇ æóáóÇ ãóÇáğÇ»</div><br>  (Had he done so, the angels would have snatched him away in public.

Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i recorded it. His saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Åöäøó ÇáúãóæúÊó ÇáøóĞöì ÊóİöÑøõæäó ãöäúåõ İóÅöäøóåõ ãõáóÜŞöíßõãú Ëõãøó ÊõÑóÏøõæäó Åöáóì ÚóÇáöãö ÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÇáÔøóåóÜÏóÉö İóíõäóÈøöÆõßõã ÈöãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (Say: "Verily, the death from which you flee will surely meet you, then you will be sent back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will inform you about what you used to do.'') is like His saying in Surat An-Nisa':   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíúäóãóÇ ÊóßõæäõæÇú íõÏúÑößßøõãõ ÇáúãóæúÊõ æóáóæú ßõäÊõãú İöì ÈõÑõæÌò ãøõÔóíøóÏóÉò</div><br>  (Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high.)  </div></body></html>
