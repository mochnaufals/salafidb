He saved them from the torment of the Fire, which is a bounty itself. Added to this blessing is the fact that they were entered into Paradise, which has delights that no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, nor has a heart ever imagined. The statement of Allah the Exalted,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáõæÇú æóÇÔúÑóÈõæÇú åóäöíÆóÇğ ÈöãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  ("Eat and drink with happiness because of what you used to do'') is similar to another of His statements,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáõæÇú æóÇÔúÑóÈõæÇú åóäöíÆóÇğ ÈöãóÂ ÃóÓúáóİúÊõãú İöì ÇáÇøñíøóÇãö ÇáúÎóÇáöíóÉö </div><br>  (Eat and drink at ease for that which you have sent on before you in days past!)(69:24) meaning this is the just reward for your deeds; surely, all this is a favor from Allah and a reward from Him.

Ath-Thawri reported from Husayn, from Mujahid, from Ibn `Abbas: "Thrones in howdahs.'' And the meaning of, (Masfufah) is they will be facing each other,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóì ÓõÑõÑò ãøõÊóŞóÜÈöáöíäó </div><br>  (Facing one another on thrones.)(37:44) Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÒóæøóÌúäóÜåõã ÈöÍõæÑò Úöíäò</div><br>  (And We shall marry them to Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes.) We made for them righteous spouses, beautiful wives from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. We mentioned the description of Al-Hur Al-`Ayn in several other places in this Tafsir, and therefore, it is not necessary to repeat their description here.  </div></body></html>
