This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ãóßøóäóÜåõãú İöíãóÂ Åöä ãøóßøóäøóÜßõãú İöíåö</div><br>  (And indeed We had firmly established them with that wherewith We have not established you!)

Then Allah mentions the reason why He punished them, and the sins which they committed. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú ßóÇäóÊ ÊøóÃúÊöíåöãú ÑõÓõáõåõã ÈöÇáúÈóíøöäóÜÊö</div><br>  (That was because there came to them their Messengers with clear evidences) meaning with clear proof and definitive evidence.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (but they disbelieved.) means, despite all these signs, they disbelieved and rejected the Message.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÎóĞóåõãõ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (So Allah seized them.) means, He destroyed them utterly, and a similar fate awaits the disbelievers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ Şóæöìøñ ÔóÏöíÏõ ÇáúÚöŞóÇÈö</div><br>  (Verily, He is All-Strong, Severe in punishment) means, He is possessed of great strength and might.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÔóÏöíÏõ ÇáúÚöŞóÇÈö</div><br>  (Severe in punishment, ) means, His punishment is severe and agonizing; we seek refuge with Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, from that.  </div></body></html>
