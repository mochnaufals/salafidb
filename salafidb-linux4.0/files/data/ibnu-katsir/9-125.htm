This Ayah is one of the mightiest evidences that faith increases and decreases, as is the belief of most of the Salaf and later generations of scholars and Imams. Many scholars said that there is a consensus on this ruling. We explained this subject in detail in the beginning of the explanation of Sahih Al-Bukhari, may Allah grant him His mercy. rAllah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó İöì ŞõáõæÈöåöã ãøóÑóÖñ İóÒóÇÏóÊúåõãú ÑöÌúÓğÇ Åöáóì ÑöÌúÓöåöãú</div><br>  (But as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it will add Rijs to their Rijs.) the Surah increases them in doubt, and brings more suspicion on top of the doubts and suspicion that they had before. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõäóÒøöáõ ãöäó ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäö ãóÇ åõæó ÔöİóÂÁñ</div><br>  (And We send down in the Qur'an that which is a healing) 17:82, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú åõÏğì æóÔöİóÂÁñ æóÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó İöì ÁóÇĞóÇäöåöãú æóŞúÑñ æóåõæó Úóáóíúåöãú Úóãğì ÃõæúáóÜÆößó íõäóÇÏóæúäó ãöä ãøóßóÇäò ÈóÚöíÏò</div><br>  (Say: "It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Qur'an) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)''.)41:44 This indicates the misery of the hypocrites and disbelievers, since, what should bring guidance to their hearts is instead a cause of misguidance and destruction for them. Similarly, those who get upset by a type of food, for instance, will be upset and anxious even more if they are fed that food!  </div></body></html>
