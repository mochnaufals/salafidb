Here, Mujahid and Qatadah said that Buruj big stars refers to the heavenly bodies. (I say): This is like the Ayah :   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÈóÇÑóßó ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóáó İöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ÈõÑõæÌÇğ</div><br>  (Blessed be He Who has placed the big stars in the heavens.) 25:61 `Atiyah Al-`Awfi said: "Buruj here refers to sentinel fortresses.'' He made the "shooting stars'' to guard it against the evil devils who try to listen to information conveyed at the highest heights. If any devil breaches it and advances hoping to listen, a clear "shooting star'' comes to him and destroys him. He may already have passed on whatever he heard before the fire hit him, to another devil below him; the latter will then take it to his friends among humans, as is stated in the Sahih. Explaining this Ayah, Al-Bukhari reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ŞóÖóì Çááåõ ÇáúÃóãúÑó İöí ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö ÖóÑóÈóÊö ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉõ ÈöÃóÌúäöÍóÊöåóÇ ÎõÖúÚóÇäğÇ áöŞóæúáöåö ßóÃóäøóåõ ÓöáúÓöáóÉñ Úóáóì ÕóİúæóÇä»</div><br>  (When Allah decrees any matter in heaven, the angels beat their wings in submission to His Word, with a sound like a chain beating on a smooth rock.'')  (`Ali and other subnarrators said, "The sound reaches them.'') "When the fright leaves their (angels') hearts, they (angels) are asked: `What did your Lord say' They respond: "The truth. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.' So those who hope to hear something listen, and they are standing one above the other.'' Sufyan the narrator described them with a gesture, spreading the fingers of his right hand and holding it in such a way that the fingers were above one another. "Sometimes the flaming fire hits one of these listeners before he is able to convey what he has heard to the one who is beneath him, and he is burned up, or sometimes the fire does not hit him until he has pit on to the one beneath him, so he brings it to the earth.'' Perhaps Sufyan said: "...until it reaches the earth and he puts it into the mouth of the sorcerer or fortune-teller, so that after telling a hundred lies he gets something right, and the people say, `Did he not tell us that on such and such a day such and such would happen, and we found it to be the truth among the statements which were heard from heaven.''' Then Allah mentions His creation of the earth and how He spread it out, and the firm mountains, valleys, lands and sands that he has placed in it, and the plants and fruits that He causes to grow in their appropriate locations.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ãøóæúÒõæäò</div><br>  (all kinds of things in due proportion.) Ibn `Abbas said that this means with their predetermined proportions. This was also the opinion of Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Abu Malik, Mujahid, Al-Hakim bin `Utaybah, Al-Hasan bin Muhammad, Abu Salih and Qatadah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ áóßõãú İöíåóÇ ãóÚóÜíöÔó</div><br>  (And We have provided therein means of living, for you) Here Allah mentions that He created the earth with different means of provisions and livelihood of all kinds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä áøóÓúÊõãú áóåõ ÈöÑóÒöŞöíäó</div><br>  (and for those whom you provide not.) Mujahid said, "This refers to the riding animals and the cattle.'' Ibn Jarir said, "They are slaves, men and women, as well as the animals and the cattle. The meaning is that Allah, may He be exalted, is reminding them of the ways of earning provision that He has made easy for them, and of the animals that He has subjugated for them to ride and to eat, and the slaves from whom they benefit, but the provision of all of these comes from Allah alone.''  </div></body></html>
