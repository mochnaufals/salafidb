Similar was said by Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Qatadah, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others. Qatadah commented on,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú åóÜĞöåö ÃóäúÚóÜãñ æóÍóÑúËñ ÍöÌúÑñ</div><br>  (They say that such and such cattle and crops are Hijr,) "It is a prohibition that the Shayatin appointed for their wealth, and a type of exaggeration and extremism that did not come from Allah.'' `Abdur-Rahman Ibn Zayd bin Aslam said that, d   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍöÌúÑò</div><br>  (Hijr,) refers to what the idolators designated for their deities. As-Suddi said that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóØúÚóãõåóÂ ÅöáÇøó ãóä äøóÔóÂÁõ ÈöÒóÚúãöåöãú</div><br>  (And none should eat of them except those whom we allow, they claimed...) means, "They said, only those whom we choose can eat of them., and the rest are prohibited from eating them.'' Similar to this honorable Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóÑóÃóíúÊõãú ãøóÂ ÃóäÒóáó Çááøóåõ áóßõãú ãøöä ÑøöÒúŞò İóÌóÚóáúÊõãú ãøöäúåõ ÍóÑóÇãğÇ æóÍóáÇóáÇğ Şõáú ÁóÂááøóåõ ÃóĞöäó áóßõãú Ãóãú Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÊóİúÊóÑõæäó </div><br>  (Say: "Tell me, what provision Allah has sent down to you!

Abu Bakr bin `Ayyash said that `Asim bin Abi An-Najud said, "Abu Wa'il said to me, `Do you know the meaning of the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäúÚóÜãñ ÍõÑøöãóÊú ÙõåõæÑõåóÇ æóÃóäúÚóÜãñ áÇøó íóĞúßõÑõæäó ÇÓúãó Çááøóåö ÚóáóíúåóÇ</div><br>  (And (they say) there are cattle forbidden to be used for burden, and cattle on which the Name of Allah is not pronounced.) I said, `No.' He said, `It is the Bahirah, which they would not use to for Hajj (either by riding it or carrying things on it).''' Mujahid also said that they were some of the camels belonging to idolators on which Allah's Name was not mentioned when riding, milking, carrying things, copulation or any other action.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇİúÊöÑóÂÁğ Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (lying against Him.) against Allah.
