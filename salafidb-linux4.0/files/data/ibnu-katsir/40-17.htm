The angels and the Ruh (Jibril) ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.) (70:3-4). If Allah wills, we will discuss below which is the most correct view the distance between the Throne and the seventh earth according to a group of earlier and later scholars. More than one scholar said that the Throne is made of red rubies. The width between two corners of it is the distance of a fifty thousand year long journey and its height above the seventh earth is the distance of a fifty thousand years long journey.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõáúŞöì ÇáÑøõæÍó ãöäú ÃóãúÑöåö Úóáóì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö</div><br>  (He sends the revelation of His command to any of His servants He wills,) This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõäóÒøöáõ ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉó ÈöÇáúÑøõæÍö ãöäú ÃóãúÑöåö Úóáóì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö Ãóäú ÃóäúĞöÑõæÇú Ãóäøóåõ áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇó ÃóäóÇú İóÇÊøóŞõæäö </div><br>  (He sends down the angels with the Ruh (revelation) of His command to whom of His servants He wills (saying): "Warn mankind that none has the right to be worshipped but I, so have Taqwa of Me.'')

That is the Day when everyone will find out about his deeds, good and bad.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó åõã ÈóÜÑöÒõæäó áÇó íóÎúİóì Úóáóì Çááøóåö ãöäúåõãú ÔóìúÁñ</div><br>  (The Day when they will come out, nothing of them will be hidden from Allah.) means, they will all appear in the open, with nothing to give them shelter or shade, or cover them.

This Day no injustice (shall be done to anybody). Truly, Allah is swift in reckoning.) Here Allah tells us of His justice when He judges between His creation; He does not do even a speck of dust's weight of injustice, whether it be for good or for evil. For every good deed He gives a tenfold reward and for every bad deed He gives recompense of one bad deed. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó Ùõáúãó Çáúíóæúãó</div><br>  (This Day no injustice (shall be done to anybody).) It was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÚöÈóÇÏöí Åöäøöí ÍóÑøóãúÊõ ÇáÙøõáúãó Úóáì äóİúÓöí æóÌóÚóáúÊõåõ Èóíúäóßõãú ãõÍóÑøóãğÇ İóáóÇ ÊóÙóÇáóãõæÇ Åáì Ãä ŞÇá íóÇ ÚöÈóÇÏöí ÅöäøóãóÇ åöíó ÃóÚúãóÇáõßõãú ÃõÍúÕöíåóÇ Úóáóíúßõãú Ëõãøó Ãõæóİøöíßõãú ÅöíøóÇåóÇ¡ İóãóäú æóÌóÏó ÎóíúÑğÇ İóáúíóÍúãóÏö Çááåó ÊóÈóÇÑóßó æóÊóÚóÇáóì¡ æóãóäú æóÌóÏó ÛóíúÑó Ğóáößó İóáóÇ íóáõæãóäøó ÅöáøóÇ äóİúÓóå»</div><br>  ("O My servants, I have forbidden injustice for Myself, and made it unlawful for you, so do not commit injustice to one another ...'') up to: ("O My servants, these are your deeds, I record them for you then I will recompense you for them.
