So he says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíõÑöíóßõãú ãøöäú ÁóÇíóÜÊöåö</div><br>  (that He may show you of His signs) meaning, by His power.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğáößó áÂíóÜÊò áøößõáøö ÕóÈøóÇÑò ÔóßõæÑò</div><br>  (Verily, in this are signs for every patient, grateful.) means, every person who bears difficulty with patience and who gives thanks at times of ease. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÛóÔöíóåõãú ãøóæúÌñ ßóÇáÙøõáóáö</div><br>  (And when waves cover them like shades,) meaning, like mountains or clouds,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏóÚóæõÇú Çááøóåó ãõÎúáöÕöíäó áóåõ ÇáÏøöíäó</div><br>  (they invoke Allah, making their invocations for Him only.)

Mujahid said, "This refers to the disbelievers -- as if he interpreted the word Muqtasid to mean denier as in the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ äóÌøóÇåõãú Åöáóì ÇáúÈóÑøö ÅöĞóÇ åõãú íõÔúÑößõæäó</div><br>  (but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others) (29:65).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÌúÍóÏõ ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊöäóÂ ÅöáÇøó ßõáøõ ÎóÊøóÇÑò ßóİõæÑò</div><br>  (And Our Ayat are not denied except by every Khattar Kafur.) Khattar means one who betrays or stabs in the back. This was the view of Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Malik, narrating from Zayd bin Aslam. This word describes a person who, whenever he makes a promise, breaks his promise, and it refers to the worst form of treachery.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóİõæÑñ</div><br>  (Kafur) means, one who denies blessings and does not give thanks for them, rather he forgets them and does not remember them.  </div></body></html>
