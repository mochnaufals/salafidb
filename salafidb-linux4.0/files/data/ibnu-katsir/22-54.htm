And Allah knows best. Al-Bukhari said, "Ibn `Abbas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÃõãúäöíøóÊöåö</div><br>  (in his recitation (of the revelation).) "When he spoke, the Shaytan threw (some falsehood) into his speech, but Allah abolished that which the Shaytan threw in.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó íõÍúßöãõ Çááøóåõ ÁóÇíóÜÊöåö</div><br>  (Then Allah establishes His revelations.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ Êóãóäøóì ÃóáúŞóì ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ İöì ÃõãúäöíøóÊöåö</div><br>  (when he did recite (the revelation), Shaytan threw (some falsehood) in it) "When he spoke, the Shaytan threw (some falsehood) into his speech.''

It was said that it refers to his recitation, whereas,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÃóãóÇäöìøó</div><br>  (but they trust upon Amani) means they speak but they do not write. Al-Baghawi and the majority of the scholars of Tafsir said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êóãóäøóì</div><br>  (he did recite) "Reciting the Book of Allah.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáúŞóì ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ İöì ÃõãúäöíøóÊöåö</div><br>  (Shaytan threw (some falsehood) in it) "In his recitation.''

The meaning of the word Naskh in Arabic is to remove or lift away. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "This means, Allah cancels out that which the Shaytan throws in.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ Úóáöíãñ</div><br>  (And Allah is All-Knower,) means, He knows all matters and events that will happen, and nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (All-Wise.) means, in His decree, creation and command, He has perfect wisdom and absolute proof, hence He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíóÌúÚóáó ãóÇ íõáúŞöì ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ İöÊúäóÉğ áøöáøóĞöíäó İöì ŞõáõæÈöåöã ãøóÑóÖñ</div><br>  (That He (Allah) may make what is thrown in by Shaytan a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease) meaning, doubt, Shirk, disbelief and hypocrisy.

In this world, He guides them to the truth and helps them to follow it and to resist and avoid falsehood; in the Hereafter, He will guide them to the straight path which leads to the degrees of Paradise, and He will save them from the painful torment and the dismal levels of Hell.  </div></body></html>
