They neither repent from their previous sins nor learn a lesson for the future. Mujahid said that hypocrites are tested with drought and hunger.

This is the description of hypocrites in this life, for they do not remain where the truth is being declared, neither accepting nor understanding it, just as Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ áóåõãú Úóäö ÇáÊøóĞúßöÑóÉö ãõÚúÑöÖöíäó - ßóÃóäøóåõãú ÍõãõÑñ ãøõÓúÊóäİöÑóÉñ - İóÑøóÊú ãöä ŞóÓúæóÑóÉò </div><br>  (Then what is wrong with them that they turn away from admonition As if they were wild donkeys.
