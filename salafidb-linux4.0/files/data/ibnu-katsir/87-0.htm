The proof of this is what Al-Bukhari recorded from Al-Bara' bin `Azib, that he said, "The first people to come to us (in Al-Madinah) from the Companions of the Prophet were Mus`ab bin `Umayr and Ibn Umm Maktum, who taught us the Qur'an; then `Ammar, Bilal and Sa`d came. Then `Umar bin Al-Khattab came with a group of twenty people, after which the Prophet came. I have not seen the people of Al-Madinah happier with anything more than their happiness with his coming (to Al-Madinah). This was reached to such an extent that I saw the children and little ones saying, `This is the Messenger of Allah who has come.' Thus, he came, but he did not come until after I had already recited (i.e., learned how to recite)   <br><div id="arabic" dir=rtl>ÓóÈøöÍö ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøößó ÇáÇøÚúáóì </div><br>  (Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.) (87:1) as well as other Surahs similar to it.'' It has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said to Mu`adh,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóáøóÇ ÕóáøóíúÊó ÈöÜÜ</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÈøöÍö ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøößó ÇáÇøÚúáóì </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÔøóãúÓö æóÖõÍóÜåóÇ </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóíúáö ÅöĞóÇ íóÛúÔóì »</div><br>  (Why didn't you recite "Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,''; "By the sun and its brightness,'' and "By the night when it envelopes.'') Imam Ahmad recorded from An-Nu`man bin Bashir that the Messenger of Allah recited   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÈøöÍö ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøößó ÇáÇøÚúáóì </div><br>  æ   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú ÃóÊóÇßó ÍóÏöíËõ ÇáúÛóÜÔöíóÉö </div><br>  Surat Al-A`la (chapter 87) and Surat Al-Ghashiyh (chapter 88) in the two `Id prayers. If the `Id prayer fell on Friday, he would recite them in both prayers (`Id and Salat Al-Jumu`ah). Muslim also recorded this in his Sahih, as well as Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. The wording of Muslim and the Sunan compilers says, "He used to recite   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÈøöÍö ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøößó ÇáÇøÚúáóì </div><br>  æ   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú ÃóÊóÇßó ÍóÏöíËõ ÇáúÛóÜÔöíóÉö </div><br>  Surat Al-A`la (chapter 87) and Surat Al-Ghashiyh (chapter 88) for the two `Ids and Jumu`ah. If they occurred on the same day, he would recite them in both of them.'' In his Musnad, Imam Ahmad recorded on the authority of Ubayy bin Ka`b, Abdullah bin `Abbas, `Abdur-Rahman bin Abza, and the Mother of the believers, `A'ishah, that the Messenger of Allah used to recite   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÈøöÍö ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøößó ÇáÇøÚúáóì </div><br>  æ   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó </div><br>  æ   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó Çááøóåõ ÃóÍóÏñ </div><br>  (Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.) and (Say: `O you who disbelieve.') and (Say: `He is Allah, the One.') `A'ishah added in her version that he would also recite the Mu`awwidhatayn (Al-Falaq and An-Nas).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÓúãö Çááøóåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíã</div><br>  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  </div></body></html>
