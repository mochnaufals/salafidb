Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, "Abu Bakr sent me during that Hajj with those dispatched on the day of Sacrifice to declare in Mina that no Mushrik will be allowed to attend Hajj after that year, nor will a naked person be allowed to perform Tawaf.'' Humayd said, "The Prophet then sent `Ali bin Abi Talib and commanded him to announce Bara'ah.'' Abu Hurayrah said, "Ali publicized Bara'ah with us to the gathering in Mina on the day of Sacrifice, declaring that no Mushrik shall perform Hajj after that year, nor shall a naked person perform Tawaf around the House.'' Al-Bukhari also collected this Hadith the this narration of which, Abu Hurayrah said, "On the day of Nahr, Abu Bakr sent me along with other announcers to Mina to make a public announcement that `No pagan is allowed to perform Hajj after this year, and no naked person is allowed to perform the Tawaf around the Ka`bah.' Abu Bakr was leading the people in that Hajj season, and in the year of `The Farewell Hajj' when the Prophet performed Hajj, no Mushrik performed Hajj.''' This is the narration that Al-Bukhari recorded in the Book on Jihad. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported a narration from Abu Ja`far Muhammad bin `Ali bin Al-Husayn who said, "When Bara'ah was revealed to Allah's Messenger , and he had sent Abu Bakr to oversee the Hajj rites for the people, he was asked, `O Messenger of Allah! Why not send this message to Abu Bakr' So he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íõÄóÏøöí Úóäøöí ÅöáøóÇ ÑóÌõáñ ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÈóíúÊöí»</div><br>  (It will not be accepted to have been from me if it is not from a man from my family.) Then he called for `Ali and said to him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÎúÑõÌú ÈöåĞöåö ÇáúŞöÕøóÉö ãöäú ÕóÏúÑö ÈóÑóÇÁóÉó æóÃóĞøöäú İöí ÇáäøóÇÓö íóæúãó ÇáäøóÍúÑö ÅöĞóÇ ÇÌúÊóãóÚõæÇ Èöãöäğì¡ Ãóäøóåõ áóÇ íóÏúÎõáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ßóÇİöÑñ¡ æóáóÇ íóÍõÌøõ ÈóÚúÏó ÇáúÚóÇãö ãõÔúÑößñ¡ æóáóÇ íóØõæİõ ÈöÇáúÈóíúÊö ÚõÑúíóÇäñ¡ æóãóäú ßóÇäó áóåõ ÚöäúÏó ÑóÓõæáö Çááåö Õáì Çááå Úáíå æÓáøã ÚóåúÏñ İóåõæó áóåõ Åöáóì ãõÏøóÊöå»</div><br>  (Take this section from the beginning of Bara'ah and proclaim to the people on the day of the Sacrifice while they are gathered at Mina that no disbeliever will enter Paradise, no idolator will be permitted to perform Hajj after the year, there will be no Tawaf while naked, and whoever has a covenant with Allah's Messenger, then it shall be valid until the time of its expiration.)  `Ali rode the camel of Allah's Messenger named Al-`Adba' until he caught up with Abu Bakr in route. When Abu Bakr saw him he said, `Are you here as a commander or a follower.' `Ali replied, `A follower.' They continued on. Abu Bakr lead the people in Hajj while the Arabs were camping in their normal locations from Jahiliyyah. On the day of Sacrifice, `Ali bin Abi Talib stood and proclaimed, `O people! No disbeliever will be admitted into Paradise, no idolator will be permitted to perform Hajj next year, there shall be no Tawaf while naked, and whoever has a covenant with Allah's Messenger , then it shall be valid until its time of expiration.' So no idolator performed Hajj after that year, Tawaf around the House while naked ceased. Then they returned to Allah's Messenger . So this was the declaration of innocence, whoever among the idolators had no treaty, then he had a treaty of peace for one year, if he had a particular treaty, then it was valid until its date of expiration.''  </div></body></html>
