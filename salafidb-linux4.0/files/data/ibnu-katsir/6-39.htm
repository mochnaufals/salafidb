Certainly, Allah is able to send an Ayah (sign). But, He decided out of His wisdom to delay that, because if He sends an Ayah of their liking and they still do not believe, this will hasten their punishment as with the previous nations.

Mujahid commented, "Meaning, various species that have distinct names.'' Qatadah said, "Birds are an Ummah, humans are an Ummah and the Jinns are an Ummah.'' As-Suddi said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Ãõãóãñ ÃóãúËóÜáõßõãú</div><br>  (but are Umam like you.) means, creations (or species).

In another Ayah, Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ãöä ÏóÂÈøóÉò İöí ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöáÇøó Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÑöÒúŞõåóÇ æóíóÚúáóãõ ãõÓúÊóŞóÑøóåóÇ æóãõÓúÊóæúÏóÚóåóÇ ßõáøñ İöì ßöÊóÇÈò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  (And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus, grave, etc.). All is in a Clear Book.) 11:6, there is a record of their names, numbers, movements, and lack of movement.

It was also said that the Day of Resurrection gathers them, for in another Ayah, Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÇáúæõÍõæÔõ ÍõÔöÑóÊú </div><br>  (And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together.) 81:5 `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Ãõãóãñ ÃóãúËóÜáõßõãú ãøóÇ İóÑøóØúäóÇ İöì ÇáßöÊóÜÈö ãöä ÔóìúÁò Ëõãøó Åöáóì ÑóÈøöåöãú íõÍúÔóÑõæäó</div><br>  (but are Umam like you.
