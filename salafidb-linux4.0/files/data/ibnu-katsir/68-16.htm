This is because the liar, due to his weakness and his disgracefulness, only seeks protection in his false oaths which he boldly swears to while using Allah's Names, and he uses them (false oaths) all the time and out of place (i.e., unnecessarily). Ibn `Abbas said, "Al-Mahin means the liar.''

It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs that Mujahid reported from Tawus that Ibn `Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah once passed by two graves and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöäøóåõãóÇ áóíõÚóĞøóÈóÇäö æóãóÇ íõÚóĞøóÈóÇäö İöí ßóÈöíÑò¡ ÃóãøóÇ ÃóÍóÏõåõãóÇ İóßóÇäó áóÇ íóÓúÊóÊöÑõ ãöäó ÇáúÈóæúáö¡ æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáúÇÎóÑõ İóßóÇäó íóãúÔöí ÈöÇáäøóãöíãóÉ»</div><br>  (Verily, these two are being punished, and they are not being punished for something major. One of them was not careful about protecting himself from urine (when relieving himself). The other one used to spread Namimah.)'' This Hadith has been recorded by the Group in their books through routes of transmission that are all on the authority of Mujahid. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hudhayfah said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóÏúÎõáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ŞóÊøóÇÊ»</div><br>  (The slanderer will not enter into Paradise.)'' This Hadith has been reported by the Group except for Ibn Majah.

Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚõÊõáøò ÈóÚúÏó Ğóáößó Òóäöíãò </div><br>  (`Utul, and moreover Zanim.) `Utul means one who is cruel, harsh, strong, greedy and stingy. Imam Ahmad recorded from Al-Harithah bin Wahb that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ÃõäóÈøöÆõßõãú ÈöÃóåúáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¿ ßõáøõ ÖóÚöíİò ãõÊóÖóÚøöİò áóæú ÃóŞúÓóãó Úóáóì Çááåö áóÃóÈóÑøóåõ.

When he swears by Allah, he fulfills his oath. Shall I inform you of the people of the Fire Every `Utul (cruel person), Jawwaz and arrogant person.) Al-Waki` said, "It (`Utul) is every Jawwaz, Ja`zari and arrogant person.'' Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this in their Two Sahihs, as well as the rest of the Group, except for Abu Dawud. All of its routes of transmission are by way of Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Shu`bah who both reported it from Sa`id bin Khalid. The scholars of Arabic language have said that Ja`zari means rude and harsh, while Jawwaz means greedy and stingy. Concerning the word Zanim, Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚõÊõáøò ÈóÚúÏó Ğóáößó Òóäöíãò </div><br>  (`Utul (cruel), and moreover Zanim.) "A man from the Quraysh who stands out among them like the sheep that has had a piece of its ear cut off.'' The meaning of this is that he is famous for his evil just as a sheep that has a piece of its ear cut off stands out among its sister sheep. In the Arabic language the Zanim is a person who is adopted among a group of people (i.e., he is not truly of them). Ibn Jarir and others among the Imams have said this. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä ßóÇäó ĞóÇ ãóÇáò æóÈóäöíäó - ÅöĞóÇ ÊõÊúáóì Úóáóíúåö ÁóÇíóÜÊõäóÇ ŞóÇáó ÃóÓóÜØöíÑõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó </div><br>  ((He was so) because he had wealth and children. When Our Ayat are recited to him, he says: "Tales of the men of old!'') Allah is saying, `this is how he responds to the favors that Allah has bestowed upon him of wealth and children, by disbelieving in Allah's Ayat and turning away from them while claiming that they are a lie that has been taken from the tales of the ancients.'
