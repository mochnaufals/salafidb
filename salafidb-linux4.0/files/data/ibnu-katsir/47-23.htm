The Hereafter is far better for him who had Taqwa of (Allah), and you will not be dealt with unjustly, even as much as a thin thread (inside a date's pit).'')(4:77) Similarly, Allah says here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áóæúáÇó äõÒøöáóÊú ÓõæÑóÉñ</div><br>  (Those who believe say: "Why is not a Surah sent down (for us)'') means, a Surah containing an order to fight.

Allah then encourages them by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóæúáóì áóåõãúØóÇÚóÉñ æóŞóæúáñ ãøóÚúÑõæİñ</div><br>  (But it was better for them, obedience and good words.) which means that it would have been better for them to listen and obey in that present situation.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ÚóÒóãó ÇáÇøñãúÑõ</div><br>  (When the matter (of fighting) is resolved.) which means when the situation becomes serious and the time of fighting truly arrives.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóæú ÕóÏóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó</div><br>  (if they had been true to Allah,) meaning, by making their intentions sincerely for Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóßóÇäó ÎóíúÑÇğ áøóåõãú</div><br>  (it would have been better for them) Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóáú ÚóÓóíúÊõãú Åöä ÊóæóáøóíúÊõãú</div><br>  (So would you perhaps, if you turned away) meaning, from Jihad and you withdrew from it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä ÊõİúÓöÏõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÊõŞóØøöÚõæÇú ÃóÑúÍóÇãóßõãú</div><br>  (spread corruption on earth, and sever your ties of kinship) which means, would you then go back to your old practices of the time of ignorance: shedding blood and severing kinship ties Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóæúáóÜÆößó ÇáøóĞöíäó áóÚóäóåõãõ Çááøóåõ İóÃóÕóãøóåõãú æóÃóÚúãóì ÃóÈúÕóÜÑóåõãú </div><br>  (Such are the ones whom Allah has cursed, so He has made them deaf and blinded their vision.) This involves a general prohibition of spreading corruption on earth, and a specific prohibition of severing the ties of kinship. In fact, Allah has commanded the people to establish righteousness on earth, as well as to join the ties of kinship by treating the relatives well in speech, actions, and spending wealth in charity. Many authentic and sound Hadiths have been reported through numerous routes of transmission from Allah's Messenger in this regard. Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÎóáóŞó Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì ÇáúÎóáúŞó İóáóãøóÇ İóÑóÛó ãöäúåõ ŞóÇãóÊö ÇáÑøóÍöãõ İóÃóÎóĞóÊú ÈöÍóŞúæö ÇáÑøóÍúãäö ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó İóŞóÇáó: ãóåú¡ İóŞóÇáóÊú: åĞóÇ ãóŞóÇãõ ÇáúÚóÇÆöĞö Èößó ãöäó ÇáúŞóØöíÚóÉö¡ İóŞóÇáó ÊóÚóÇáóì: ÃóáóÇ ÊóÑúÖóíúäó Ãóäú ÃóÕöáó ãóäú æóÕóáóßö æóÃóŞúØóÚó ãóäú ŞóØóÚóßö¿ ŞóÇáóÊú: Èóáóì¡ ŞóÇáó: İóĞóÇßö áóß»</div><br>  (After Allah completed creating the creation, the womb stood up and pulled at the lower garment of the Most Merciful. He said, 'Stop that!' It replied, 'My stand here is the stand of one seeking refuge in you from severance of ties.' Allah said, 'Would it not please you that I join whoever joins you and sever whoever severs you' It replied, 'Yes indeed!' He said, 'You are granted that!') Abu Hurayrah then added, "Read if you wish:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóáú ÚóÓóíúÊõãú Åöä ÊóæóáøóíúÊõãú Ãóä ÊõİúÓöÏõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÊõŞóØøöÚõæÇú ÃóÑúÍóÇãóßõãú </div><br>  (So would you perhaps, if you turned away, spread corruption on earth, and sever your ties of kinship)'' Then Al-Bukhari recorded it with another wording which states that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇŞúÑóÁõæÇ Åöäú ÔöÆúÊõãú</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóáú ÚóÓóíúÊõãú Åöä ÊóæóáøóíúÊõãú Ãóä ÊõİúÓöÏõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÊõŞóØøöÚõæÇú ÃóÑúÍóÇãóßõãú »</div><br>  (Read if you wish: (So would you perhaps, if you turned away, spread corruption on earth, and sever your ties of kinship)) Muslim also recorded it. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Bakrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú ĞóäúÈò ÃóÍúÑóì Ãóäú íõÚóÌøöáó Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì ÚõŞõæÈóÊóåõ İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ ãóÚó ãóÇ íóÏøóÎöÑõ áöÕóÇÍöÈöåö İöí ÇáúÇÎöÑóÉö¡ ãöäó ÇáúÈóÛúíö æóŞóØöíÚóÉö ÇáÑøóÍöã»</div><br>  (No sin deserves that Allah hasten its punishment in the worldly life, in addition to what He reserves in the Hereafter for those who commit it, more than injustice and severance of the ties of kinship.) This was also recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi said, "This Hadith is Sahih.'' Imam Ahmad recorded from Thawban, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÓóÑøóåõ ÇáäøóÓóÇÁõ İöí ÇáúÃóÌóáö æóÇáÒøöíóÇÏóÉõ İöí ÇáÑøöÒúŞö¡İóáúíóÕöáú ÑóÍöãóå»</div><br>  (Whoever likes for his life to be extended, and his provision increased, let him connect his ties of kinship.) Ahmad was alone in recording this narration, but it has a supporting narration in the Sahih. Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÑøóÍöãó ãõÚóáøóŞóÉñ ÈöÇáúÚóÑúÔö¡ æóáóíúÓó ÇáúæóÇÕöáõ ÈöÇáúãõßóÇİöìÁö¡ æóáßöäö ÇáúæóÇÕöáõ ÇáøóĞöí ÅöĞóÇ ŞõØöÚóÊú ÑóÍöãõåõ æóÕóáóåóÇ»</div><br>  (Verily, the womb is attached to the Throne. And connecting its ties does not mean dealing evenly (with the kinsfolk), but it rather means that if one's kinsfolk sever the ties, he connects them.) This Hadith was also recorded by Al-Bukhari.  Ahmad also recorded from `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊõæÖóÚõ ÇáÑøóÍöãõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö áóåóÇ (ÍõÌúäóÉñ ßóÍõÌúäóÉö) ÇáúãöÛúÒóáö Êóßóáøóãõ ÈöáöÓóÇäò ØóáöŞò ĞóáöŞò¡ İóÊóŞúØóÚõ ãóäú ŞóØóÚóåóÇ æóÊóÕöáõ ãóäú æóÕóáóåóÇ»</div><br>  (The womb will be placed on the Day of Resurrection, curved like a spinning wheel, speaking with an eloquent fluent tongue, calling to severing whoever had severed it, and joining whoever had joined it.) Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÑøóÇÍöãõæäó íóÑúÍóãõåõãõ ÇáÑøóÍúãäõ¡ ÇÑúÍóãõæÇ Ãóåúáó ÇáúÃóÑúÖö íóÑúÍóãúßõãú Ãóåúáõ ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö¡ æóÇáÑøóÍöãõ ÔõÌúäóÉñ ãöäó ÇáÑøóÍúãäö¡ ãóäú æóÕóáóåóÇ æóÕóáóÊúåõ æóãóäú ŞóØóÚóåóÇ ÈóÊøóÊúå»</div><br>  (The merciful ones will be granted mercy from the Most Merciful. Have mercy on those on earth -- the One above the heavens will then have mercy on you. And Ar-Rahim (the womb) is from Ar-Rahman, so whoever joins it, it joins him; and whoever severs it, it severs him.) Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi both recorded this Hadith and it has been reported with continuous chains of transmission. At-Trimidhi said, "Hasan Sahih.'' There are numerous other Hadiths in this regard.  </div></body></html>
