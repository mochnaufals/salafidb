Are you claiming that Allah will resurrect this' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú¡ íõãöíÊõßó Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì¡ Ëõãøó íóÈúÚóËõßó¡ Ëõãøó íóÍúÔõÑõßó Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (Yes, Allah, may He be exalted, will cause you to die, then He will resurrect you and will gather you into the Fire.)'' Then these Ayat at the end of Surah Ya Sin were revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæóáóãú íóÑó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ ÃóäøóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÜåõ ãöä äøõØúİóÉò</div><br>  (Does not man see that We have created him from Nutfah.) -- until the end of the Surah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Al-`As bin Wa'il took a bone from the bed of a valley and crumbled it in his hand, then he said to the Messenger of Allah : `Will Allah bring this back to life after it has disintegrated' The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú¡ íõãöíÊõßó Çááåõ¡ Ëõãøó íõÍúíöíßó¡ Ëõãøó íõÏúÎöáõßó Ìóåóäøóã»</div><br>  (Yes, Allah will cause you to die, then He will bring you back to life, then He will make you enter Hell.) Then the Ayat at the end of Surah Ya Sin were revealed.'' This was recorded by Ibn Jarir from Sa`id bin Jubayr. Whether these Ayat were revealed about Ubayy bin Khalaf or Al-`As bin Wa'il, or both of them, they apply to all those who deny the resurrection after death. The definite article "Al'' in   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæóáóãú íóÑó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ</div><br>  (Does not man (Al-Insan) see...) is generic, applying to all those who deny the Resurrection.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóäøóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÜåõ ãöä äøõØúİóÉò İóÅöĞóÇ åõæó ÎóÕöíãñ ãøñÈöíäñ</div><br>  (that We have created him from Nutfah. Yet behold he (stands forth) as an open opponent.) means, the one who is denying the resurrection, cannot see that the One Who initiated creation can re-create it. For Allah initiated the creation of man from semen of despised fluid, creating him from something insignificant, weak and despised, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú äóÎúáõŞßøõã ãøöä ãøóÂÁò ãøóåöíäò - İóÌóÚóáúäóÜåõ İöì ŞóÑóÇÑò ãøóßöíäò - Åöáóì ŞóÏóÑò ãøóÚúáõæãò </div><br>  (Did We not create you from a despised water Then We placed it in a place of safety, for a known period) (77:20-22)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ãöä äøõØúİóÉò ÃóãúÔóÇÌò</div><br>  (Verily, We have created man from Nutfah) (76:2). which means, from a mixture of different fluids. The One Who created man from this weak Nutfah is not unable to re-create him after his death. Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that Bishr bin Jahhash said, "One day the Messenger of Allah spat in his hand and put his finger on it, then the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÇáó Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì: ÇÈúäó ÂÏóãó Ãóäøóì ÊõÚúÌöÒõäöí æóŞóÏú ÎóáóŞúÊõßó ãöäú ãöËúáö åóĞöåö¡ ÍóÊúì ÅöĞóÇ ÓóæøóíúÊõßó æóÚóÏóáúÊõßó¡ ãóÔóíúÊó Èóíúäó ÈõÑúÏóíúßó¡ æóáöáúÃóÑúÖö ãöäúßó æóÆöíÏñ¡ İóÌóãóÚúÊó æóãóäóÚúÊó¡ ÍóÊúì ÅöĞóÇ ÈóáóÛóÊö ÇáÊøóÑóÇŞöíó ŞõáúÊó: ÃóÊóÕóÏøóŞõ¡ æóÃóäøóì ÃóæóÇäõ ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉö¿»</div><br>  (Allah, may He be exalted, says: "Son of Adam, how can you outrun Me when I have created you from something like this, and when I have fashioned you and formed you, you walk in your cloak on the earth and it groans beneath your tread. You accumulate and do not spend until the death rattle reaches your throat, then you say, `I want to give in charity,' but it is too late for charity.'')''  It was also recorded by Ibn Majah. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÖóÑóÈó áóäóÇ ãóËóáÇğ æóäóÓöìó ÎóáúŞóåõ ŞóÇáó ãóä íõÍìö ÇáúÚöÙóÜãó æóåöìó Ñóãöíãñ </div><br>  (And he puts forth for Us a parable, and forgets his own creation. He says: "Who will give life to these bones after they are rotten and have become dust'') meaning, he thinks it unlikely that Allah, the Almighty Who created the heavens and the earth, will re-create these bodies and dry bones. Man forgets about himself, that Allah created him from nothing and brought him into existence, and he knows by looking at himself that there is something greater than that which he denies and thinks impossible. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íõÍúíöíåóÇ ÇáøóĞöì ÃóäÔóÃóåóÂ Ãóæøóáó ãóÑøóÉò æóåõæó Èößõáøö ÎóáúŞò Úóáöíãñ </div><br>  (Say: "He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation!'') meaning, He knows about the bones in all areas and regions of the earth, where they have gone when they disintegrated and dispersed. Imam Ahmad recorded that Rib`i said: ""Uqbah bin `Amr said to Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, `Will you not tell us what you heard from the Messenger of Allah ' He said, `I heard him say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÑóÌõáğÇ ÍóÖóÑóåõ ÇáúãóæúÊõ¡ İóáóãøóÇ ÃóíöÓó ãöäó ÇáúÍóíóÇÉö ÃóæúÕóì Ãóåúáóåõ: ÅöĞóÇ ÃóäóÇ ãõÊøõ İóÇÌúãóÚõæÇ áöí ÍóØóÈğÇ ßóËöíÑğÇ ÌóÒúáğÇ¡ Ëõãøó ÃóæúŞöÏõæÇ İöíåö äóÇÑğÇ¡ ÍóÊúì ÅöĞóÇ ÃóßóáóÊú áóÍúãöí¡ æóÎóáóÕóÊú Åöáóì ÚóÙúãöí İóÇãúÊõÍöÔúÊõ¡ İóÎõĞõæåóÇ İóÏõŞøõæåóÇ İóĞóÑøõæåóÇ İöí Çáúíóãøö¡ İóİóÚóáõæÇ¡ İóÌóãóÚóåõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì Åöáóíúåö¡ Ëõãøó ŞóÇáó áóåõ: áöãó İóÚóáúÊó Ğóáößó¿ ŞóÇáó: ãöäú ÎóÔúíóÊößó¡ İóÛóİóÑó Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó áóå»</div><br>  (Death approached a man and when there was no longer any hope for him, he said to his family, "When I die, gather a lot of firewood, then set it ablaze until my flesh is consumed and it reaches my bones and they become brittle. Then take them and grind them, and scatter them in the sea.'' So they did that, but Allah gathered him together and said to him: "Why did you do that'' He said, "Because I feared You.'' So Allah forgave him.)' `Uqbah bin `Amr said, `I heard him say that, and the man was a gravedigger.''' Many versions of this Hadith were recorded in the Two Sahihs. One of these versions mentions that he commanded his sons to burn him and then grind his remains into small pieces, and then scatter half of them on land and half of them on the sea on a windy day. So they did that, then Allah commanded the sea to gather together whatever remains were in it, and He commanded the land to do likewise, then he said to him, "Be!'', and he was a man, standing. Allah said to him. "What made you do what you did'' He said, "The fear of You, and You know best.'' Straight away He forgave him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóáó áóßõã ãøöäó ÇáÔøóÌóÑö ÇáÇøñÎúÖóÑö äóÇÑÇğ İóÅöĞóÂ ÃóäÊõã ãøöäúå ÊõæŞöÏõæäó </div><br>  (He Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold you kindle therewith.) means, the One Who initiated the creation of this tree from water, when it has become green and beautiful, bearing fruit, then He changes it until it becomes dry wood with which fires are lit. For He does whatever He wills and He is able to do whatever He wills, and none can stop Him. Qatadah said concerning the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóáó áóßõã ãøöäó ÇáÔøóÌóÑö ÇáÇøñÎúÖóÑö äóÇÑÇğ İóÅöĞóÂ ÃóäÊõã ãøöäúå ÊõæŞöÏõæäó </div><br>  (He Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold you kindle therewith.) this means, the One Who brought forth this fire from this tree is able to resurrect him. It was said that this refers to the Markh tree and the `Afar tree, which grow in the Hijaz. If one wants to light a fire but has no kindling with him, then he takes two green branches from these trees and rubs one against the other, and fire is produced from them. So they are just like kindling. This was reported from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.  </div></body></html>
