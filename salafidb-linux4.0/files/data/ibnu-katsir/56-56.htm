Allah said in this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÙöáøò ãøöä íóÍúãõæãò </div><br>  (And a shadow from Yahmum,) meaning, black smoke,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó ÈóÇÑöÏò æóáÇó ßóÑöíãò </div><br>  (Neither Barid nor Karim,) means, it neither brings soft, cool breeze nor appears clear.

Ad-Dahhak said, "Every drink that is not fresh, is not Karim (pleasant).

Allah the Exalted said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğáößó áÂíóÉğ áøöãóäú ÎóÇİó ÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö Ğáößó íóæúãñ ãøóÌúãõæÚñ áøóåõ ÇáäøóÇÓõ æóĞóáößó íóæúãñ ãøóÔúåõæÏñ - æóãóÇ äõÄóÎøöÑõåõ ÅöáÇøó áÇøğÌóáò ãøóÚúÏõæÏò - íóæúãó íóÃúÊö áÇó Êóßóáøóãõ äóİúÓñ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÅöĞúäöåö İóãöäúåõãú ÔóŞöìøñ æóÓóÚöíÏñ </div><br>  (That is a Day whereon mankind will be gathered together, and that is a Day when all will be present.

And you will drink (that) like Al-Him!) Hamim is boiling water, while Al-Him means thirsty camels, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and `Ikrimah. As-Suddi said "Al-Him is a disease that strikes camels, causing them to feel thirst, and they drink until they die.'' Therefore, he said, the people of Hell, will never quench their thirst from drinking Hamim.
