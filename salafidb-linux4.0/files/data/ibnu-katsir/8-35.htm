After Allah allowed the Prophet to migrate away from them, He sent His torment upon them on the day of Badr. During that battle, the chief pagans were killed, or captured. Allah also directed them to seek forgiveness for the sins, Shirk and wickedness they indulged in. If it was not for the fact that there were some weak Muslims living among the Makkan pagans, those Muslims who invoked Allah for His forgiveness, Allah would have sent down to them the torment that could never be averted. Allah did not do that on account of the weak, ill-treated, and oppressed believers living among them, as He reiterated about the day at Al-Hudaybiyyah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõãõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóÕóÏøõæßõãú Úóäö ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏö ÇáúÍóÑóÇãö æóÇáúåóÏúìó ãóÚúßõæİÇğ Ãóä íóÈúáõÛó ãóÍöáøóåõ æóáóæúáÇó ÑöÌóÇáñ ãøõÄúãöäõæäó æóäöÓóÂÁñ ãøõÄúãöäóÜÊñ áøóãú ÊóÚúáóãõæåõãú Ãóä ÊóØóÆõæåõãú İóÊõÕöíÈóßãú ãøöäúåõãú ãøóÚóÑøóÉñ ÈöÛóíúÑö Úöáúãò áøöíõÏúÎöáó Çááøóåõ İöì ÑóÍúãóÊöåö ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ áóæú ÊóÒóíøóáõæÇú áóÚóĞøóÈúäóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ãöäúåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈÇğ ÃóáöíãÇğ </div><br>  (They are the ones who disbelieved and hindered you from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) and detained the sacrificial animals from reaching their place of sacrifice.

Mujahid explained that this Ayah is about the Mujahidin in Allah's cause, whomever and wherever they may be.  Allah then mentioned the practice of the pagans next to Al-Masjid Al-Haram and the respect they observed in its vicinity,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÕóáÇóÊõåõãú ÚöäÏó ÇáúÈóíúÊö ÅöáÇøó ãõßóÂÁğ æóÊóÕúÏöíóÉğ</div><br>  (Their Salah (prayer) at the House was nothing but Muka' and Tasdiyah. )  `Abdullah bin `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Raja' Al-Utardi, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Hujr bin `Anbas, Nubayt bin Sharit, Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that this part of the Ayah refers to whistling. Mujahid added that the pagans used to place their fingers in their mouth (while whistling). Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÕóáÇóÊõåõãú ÚöäÏó ÇáúÈóíúÊö ÅöáÇøó ãõßóÂÁğ æóÊóÕúÏöíóÉğ</div><br>  (Their Salat at the House was nothing but Muka' and Tasdiyah.)  "The Quraysh used to perform Tawaf (encircling the Ka`bah) while naked, whistling and clapping their hands, for Muka' means `whistling', while, Tasdiyah means `clapping the hands.''' This meaning was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, by `Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-`Awfi. Similar was recorded from Ibn `Umar, Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Atiyyah Al-`Awfi, Hujr bin `Anbas and Ibn Abza.

"Muka' means `whistling', while, `Tasdiyah' means `clapping the hands.''' Sa`id bin Jubayr and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÕúÏöíóÉğ</div><br>  (and Tasdiyah), means, they hindered from the path of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.
