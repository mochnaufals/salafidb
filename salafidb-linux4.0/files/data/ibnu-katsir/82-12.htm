Al-Hasan said, "Allah will cause some parts of it to burst forth over other parts of it, and its water will go away.''

What has made you careless about your Lord, the Most Generous) This is a threat. It is not an attempt to get a reply as some people mistakenly think. They consider it as if the Most Generous is asking them so that they will say, "His honor deceived him (or made him careless of his Lord).'' rather the meaning of this Ayah is, "O Son of Adam! What has deceived you from your Lord, the Most Generous -- meaning the Most Great -- so that you went forth disobeying Him, and you met Him with that which was unbefitting.'' This is similar to what has been reported in the Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö: íóÇ ÇÈúäó ÂÏóãó ãóÇ ÛóÑøóßó Èöí¿ íóÇ ÇÈúäó ÂÏóãó ãóÇĞóÇ ÃóÌóÈúÊó ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíäó¿»</div><br>  (Allah will say on the Day of Judgement: "O Son of Adam! What has deceived you concerning Me O Son of Adam What was your response to the Messengers'') Al-Baghawi mentioned that Al-Kalbi and Muqatil said, "This Ayah was revealed about Al-Aswad bin Shariq who struck the Prophet and he was not punished in retaliation. So Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ÛóÑøóßó ÈöÑóÈøößó ÇáúßóÑöíãö</div><br>  (What has made you careless about your Lord, the Most Generous)'' Then Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞóßó İóÓóæøóÇßó İóÚóÏóáóßó </div><br>  (Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion.) meaning, `what has deceived you concerning the Most Generous Lord'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞóßó İóÓóæøóÇßó İóÚóÏóáóßó </div><br>  (Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion.) meaning, `He made you complete, straight, and perfectly balanced and proportioned in stature. He fashioned you in the best of forms and shapes.' Imam Ahmad recorded from Busr bin Jahhash Al-Qurashi that one day the Messenger of Allah spat in his palm and placed his finger on it. Then he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÇáó Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó: íóÇ ÇÈúäó ÂÏóãó Ãóäúì ÊõÚúÌöÒõäöí æóŞóÏú ÎóáóŞúÊõßó ãöäú ãöËúáö åĞöåö¿ ÍóÊúì ÅöĞóÇ ÓóæøóíúÊõßó æóÚóÏóáúÊõßó ãóÔóíúÊó Èóíúäó ÈõÑúÏóíúäö¡ æóáöáúÃóÑúÖö ãöäúßó æóÆöíÏñ¡ İóÌóãóÚúÊó æóãóäóÚúÊó ÍóÊúì ÅöĞóÇ ÈóáóÛóÊö ÇáÊøóÑóÇŞöíó ŞõáúÊó: ÃóÊóÕóÏøóŞõ æóÃóäøóì ÃóæóÇäõ ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉö¿»</div><br>  (Allah the Mighty and Sublime says: "O Son of Adam! How can you escape Me when I created you from something similar to this (spit) Then I fashioned you and made your creation balanced so that you walked between the two outer garments. And the earth has a burial place for you. So you gathered (wealth) and withheld it until your soul reached your collarbone (i.e., death comes). Then, at that time you say, `I will give charity now.' But how will there be time for charity'') This Hadith has also been recorded by Ibn Majah . Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì Ãóìøö ÕõæÑóÉò ãøóÇ ÔóÂÁó ÑóßøóÈóßó </div><br>  (In whatever form He willed, He put you together.)

The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóåóáú İöíåóÇ ãöäú ÃóæúÑóŞ»</div><br>  (Do any of them have patches of gray) The man said, "Yes.'' The Prophet asked him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÃóäúì ÃóÊóÇåóÇ Ğáöß»</div><br>  (How did this happen to them) The man replied, "It is probably an inherited genetical strain.'' The Prophet then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóåóĞóÇ ÚóÓóì Ãóäú íóßõæäó äóÒóÚóåõ ÚöÑúŞ»</div><br>  (Likewise, this (with your son) is probably an inherited genetical strain.)

But you deny (the Day of) Ad-Din.) meaning, `you are only compelled to oppose the Most Generous and meet Him with disobedience, by your rejection in your hearts of the Hereafter, the recompense and the reckoning.' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó Úóáóíúßõãú áóÍóÜİöÙöíäó - ßöÑóÇãÇğ ßóÜÊöÈöíäó - íóÚúáóãõæäó ãóÇ ÊóİúÚóáõæäó </div><br>  (But verily, over you to watch you (are) Kiraman Katibin, they know all that you do.) (82:10-12) meaning, `indeed there are noble guardian angels over you, so do not meet them with evil deeds, because they write down all that you do.'  </div></body></html>
