Would you leave the religion of Abdul-Muttalib' Abu Talib said, `Rather, I will remain on the religion of Abdul-Muttalib.'

This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Ibn Jarir recorded that Sulayman bin Buraydah said that his father said, "When the Prophet came to Makkah, he went to a grave, sat next to it, started talking and then stood up with tears in his eyes. We said, `O Allah's Messenger! We saw what you did.' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí ÇÓúÊóÃúĞóäúÊõ ÑóÈøöí İöí ÒöíóÇÑóÉö ŞóÈúÑö Ãõãøöí İóÃóĞöäó áöí¡ æóÇÓúÊóÃúĞóäúÊõåõ İöí ÇáúÇÓúÊöÛúİóÇÑö áóåóÇ İóáóãú íóÃúĞóäú áöí»</div><br>  (I asked my Lord for permission to visit the grave of my mother and He gave me permission. I asked for His permission to invoke Him for forgiveness for her, but He did not give me permission.) We never saw him more tearful than on that day.''' Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ßóÇäó áöáäøóÈöìøö æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú Ãóä íóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõæÇú áöáúãõÔúÑößöíäó</div><br>  (It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah's forgiveness for the Mushrikin) "The Prophet wanted to invoke Allah for forgiveness for his mother, but Allah did not allow him.

'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah, "They used to invoke Allah for them (pagans) until this Ayah was revealed. They then refrained from invoking Allah to forgive the dead among them, but were not stopped from invoking Allah for the living among them until they die. Allah sent this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÇÓúÊöÛúİóÇÑõ ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó áÇøğÈöíåö</div><br>  (And Ibrahim's invoking (of Allah) for his father's forgiveness was only...) 9:114.'' Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÊóÈóíøóäó áóåõ Ãóäøóåõ ÚóÏõæøñ áöáøóåö ÊóÈóÑøóÃó ãöäúåõ</div><br>  (But when it became clear to him Ibrahim that he (his father) is an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him) 9:114. Ibn `Abbas commented, "Ibrahim kept asking Allah to forgive his father until he died, when he realized that he died as an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him.'' In another narration, he said, "When his father died he realized that he died as an enemy of Allah.'' Similar was said by Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and several others. `Ubayd bin `Umayr and Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "Ibrahim will disown his father on the Day of Resurrection, but he will meet his father and see dust and fatigue on his face. He will say, `O Ibrahim! I disobeyed you, but today, I will not disobey you.' Ibrahim will say, `O Lord! You promised me that You will not disgrace me on the Day they are resurrected. What more disgrace than witnessing my father being disgraced' He will be told, `Look behind you,' where he will see a bloody hyena -- for his father will have been transformed into that -- and it will be dragged from its feet and thrown in the Fire.''' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó áÃóæøóÇåñ Íóáöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, Ibrahim was Awwah and was forbearing.) means, he invoked Allah always, according to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud. Several narrations report this from Ibn Mas`ud. It was also said that, `Awwah', means, `who invokes Allah with humility', `merciful', `who believes with certainty', `who praises (Allah)', and so forth.  </div></body></html>
