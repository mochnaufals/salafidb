This Ayah carries a stern warning for the Muslim Ummah against imitating the ways and methods of the Jews and Christians, after they have acquired knowledge of the Qur'an and Sunnah, may Allah grant us refuge from this behavior.

Yatlunahu Haqqan Tilawatih.)  `Abdur-Razzaq said from Ma`mar, from Qatadah, "They are the Jews and Christians.'' This is the opinion of `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and it was also chosen by Ibn Jarir. Sa`id reported from Qatadah, "They are the Companions of the Messenger of Allah .'' Abu Al-`Aliyah said that Ibn Mas`ud said, "By He in Whose Hand is my soul! The right Tilawah is allowing what it makes lawful, prohibiting what it makes unlawful, reciting it as it was revealed by Allah, not changing the words from their places, and not interpreting it with other than its actual interpretation.'' As-Suddi reported from Abu Malik from Ibn `Abbas who said about this Ayah (2:121): "They make lawful what it allows and they prohibit what it makes unlawful, and they do not alter its wordings.'' `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "They are those who when they recite an Ayah that mentions mercy, they ask Allah for it, and when they recite an Ayah that mentions torment, they seek refuge with Allah from it.'' This meaning was attributed to the Prophet , for when he used to recite an Ayah of mercy, he invoked Allah for mercy, and when he recited an Ayah of torment, he sought refuge from it with Allah.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó íõÄúãöäõæäó Èöåö</div><br>  (they are the ones who believe therein)  explains the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÂÊóíúäóÜåõãõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó íóÊúáõæäóåõ ÍóŞøó ÊöáÇóæóÊöåö</div><br>  (Those to whom We gave the Book. Yatlunahu Haqqa Tilawatihi).  These Ayat mean, "Those among the People of the Book who perfectly adhered to the Books that were revealed to the previous Prophets, will believe in what I have sent you with, O Muhammad!'' Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú Ãóäøóåõãú ÃóŞóÇãõæÇú ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉó æóÇáÅöäÌöíáó æóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíåöãú ãøöä ÑøóÈøöåöãú áÇøßóáõæÇú ãöä İóæúŞöåöãú æóãöä ÊóÍúÊö ÃóÑúÌõáöåöã</div><br>  (And if only they had acted according to the Tawrah, the Injil, and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Qur'an), they would surely, have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet.)
