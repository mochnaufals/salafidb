Maymun bin Mihran said that those on the right side are lesser in rank than the foremost in faith. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ Çáúíóãöíäö ãóÂ ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ Çáúíóãöíäö </div><br>  (And those on the right -- how (fortunate) will be those on the right) who are those on the right, what is their condition and what will their final destination be like Allah next answers this question by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÓöÏúÑò ãøóÎúÖõæÏò </div><br>  ((they will be) among Sidr Makhdud.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ibn Al-Ahwas, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, As-Safr bin Nusayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Abdullah bin Kathir, As-Suddi, Abu Hazrah and several others said, "The kind without thorns.'' And from Ibn `Abbas: "It is the one that is laden with fruits.'' This is also reported from `Ikrimah and Mujahid. Similar was also said by Qatadah as we mentioned. So it is the one with a full load of fruits without thorns. So it appears that both meanings apply here. The lote tree, of this life is thorny and carries few fruits. In the Hereafter, it is the opposite; it does not have thorns and carries plenty of fruit, the weight of which strains its trunk. `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, "I was sitting with Allah's Messenger , when a bedouin came and said, `O Messenger of Allah! Have you heard about the tree that has more thorns than any other being in Paradise' Meaning the Talh tree. So Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó íóÌúÚóáõ ãóßóÇäó ßõáøö ÔóæúßóÉò ãöäúåóÇ ËóãóÑóÉğ¡ ãöËúáó ÎõÕúæóÉö ÇáÊøóíúÓö ÇáúãóáúÈõæÏö¡ İöíåóÇ ÓóÈúÚõæäó áóæúäğÇ ãöäó ÇáØøóÚóÇãö¡ áóÇ íõÔúÈöåõ áóæúäñ ÂÎóÑ»</div><br>  (For each spot that there was a thorn on it, Allah instead put fruit, similar to a castrated tight skinned ram, a food having seventy colors, each different than the other.) Allah's said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóØóáúÍò ãøóäÖõæÏò </div><br>  (and among Talh Mandud.) refers to large thorny shrub that used to grow in the area of Hijaz (Western Arabia). Mujahid said that   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóäúÖõæÏò</div><br>  (Mandud) means: "Its fruits are piled on top of each other. Allah is reminding the Quraysh of these kinds of trees, since they used to like the shade that the Talh and Sidr provided for them.'' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Sa`id said that   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóØóáúÍò ãøóäÖõæÏò </div><br>  (Talh Mandud) means: "The banana tree.'' And he (Ibn Abi Hatim) said, "Similar is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Al-Hasan, `Ikrimah, Qasamah bin Zuhayr, Qatadah and Abu Hazrah. '' Mujahid and Ibn Zayd said similalry, Ibn Zayd added, "The people of Yemen call the banana tree, Talh.'' Ibn Jarir mentioned no other explanation for Talh. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÙöáøò ãøóãúÏõæÏò </div><br>  (And in shade Mamdud (extended).) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÔóÌóÑóÉğ íóÓöíÑõ ÇáÑøóÇßöÈõ İöí ÙöáøöåóÇ ãöÇÆóÉó ÚóÇãò áóÇ íóŞúØóÚõåóÇ¡ ÇŞúÑóÄõæÇ Åöäú ÔöÆúÊõãú:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÙöáøò ãøóãúÏõæÏò »</div><br>  (In Paradise, there is a tree that a rider can travel for a hundred years under its shade but would not be able to pass it. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim also collected this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÔóÌóÑóÉğ íóÓöíÑõ ÇáÑøóÇßöÈõ İöí ÙöáøöåóÇ ãöÇÆóÉó ÚóÇãò¡ ÇŞúÑóÄõæÇ Åöäú ÔöÆúÊõãú:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÙöáøò ãøóãúÏõæÏò »</div><br>  (There is a tree in Paradise the shade of which a rider would take one hundred years to pass. Recite if you will: (And in shade extended.)) Muslim, Al-Bukhari and `Abdur-Razzaq collected this Hadith. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİóÜßöåóÉò ßóËöíÑóÉò - áÇøó ãóŞúØõæÚóÉò æóáÇó ãóãúäõæÚóÉò </div><br>  (And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) indicating that they will have plenty of fruits of various kinds, that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of and no heart has ever imagined, as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøóãóÇ ÑõÒöŞõæÇú ãöäúåóÇ ãöä ËóãóÑóÉò ÑøöÒúŞÇğ ŞóÇáõæÇú åóÜĞóÇ ÇáøóĞöì ÑõÒöŞúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáõ æóÃõÊõæÇú Èöåö ãõÊóÔóÜÈöåÇğ</div><br>  (Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: "This is what we were provided with before, "and they will be given things in resemblance.)(2:25)  The shape will appear similar, but the taste is different. In the Two Sahihs, Sidrat Al-Muntaha (the tree in the seventh heaven) is described as:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöĞóÇ æóÑóŞõåóÇ ßóÂĞóÇäö ÇáúİöíóáóÉö¡ æóäóÈúŞõåóÇ ãöËúáõ ŞöáóÇáö åóÌóÑ»</div><br>  (...its leaves were like the ears of elephants and its Nabir fruits resembled the clay jugs of Hajar.) The Two Sahihs also collected a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas, who said, "The sun was eclipsed and Allah's Messenger led the people in the Eclipse prayer. They asked, `O Allah's Messenger, we saw you reach out for something while standing (in prayer), but then you stepped back.' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí ÑóÃóíúÊõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó İóÊóäóÇæóáúÊõ ãöäúåóÇ ÚõäúŞõæÏğÇ¡ æóáóæú ÃóÎóĞúÊõåõ áóÃóßóáúÊõãú ãöäúåõ ãóÇ ÈóŞöíóÊö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ»</div><br>  (I saw Paradise and reached out for a cluster of fruit from it. Had I done so, you would have kept eating from it for the remainder of the life of the world.)'' Imam Ahmad recorded that `Utbah bin `Abd As-Sulami said, "A bedouin man came to the Messenger of Allah and asked him about the Hawd and Paradise. The bedouin asked, `Does Paradise have fruits' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú¡ æóİöíåóÇ ÔóÌóÑóÉñ ÊõÏúÚóì ØõæÈóì»</div><br>  (Yes, and it also has a tree called Tuba.) (He ) said something more saying but I could not recall it. The bedouin asked, `Does it look like any of the trees that grow in our area' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóíúÓóÊú ÊõÔúÈöåõ ÔóíúÆğÇ ãöäú ÔóÌóÑö ÃóÑúÖöß»</div><br>  (There is nothing resembling it among the trees in your land.) The Prophet then asked him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊóíúÊó ÇáÔøóÇãó¿»</div><br>  (Have you traveled to Ash-Sham area) The bedouin said: `No.' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊõÔúÈöåõ ÔóÌóÑóÉğ ÈöÇáÔøóÇãö ÊõÏúÚóì ÇáúÌóæúÒóÉó¡ ÊóäúÈõÊõ Úóáóì ÓóÇŞò æóÇÍöÏóÉò¡ æóíóäúİóÑöÔõ ÃóÚúáóÇåóÇ»</div><br>  (It looks like a tree that grows in Ash-Sham area and is called Al-Jawzah, which stands on one stem but its branches grow all around to the fullest extent.) The bedouin asked, `How big is the cluster of its fruits' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÓöíÑóÉõ ÔóåúÑò áöáúÛõÑóÇÈö ÇáúÃóÈúŞóÚö æóáóÇ íóİúÊõÑ»</div><br>  (The distance that the crow flies in one month without rest.) The bedouin asked, `How huge its trunk is' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæö ÇÑúÊóÍóáóÊú ÌóĞóÚóÉñ ãöä ÅöÈöáö Ãóåúáößó ãóÇ ÃóÍóÇØóÊú ÈöÃóÕúáöåóÇ¡ ÍóÊúì ÊóäúßóÓöÑó ÊóÑúŞõæóÊõåóÇ åóÑóãğÇ»</div><br>  (If a four-year old she-camel that your family owns travels it, it will not completely pass its trunk until its shoulders break from old age.) The man asked, `Does it bear grapes' The Prophet answered in yes. The bedouin asked, `How big are the grapes' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóáú ĞóÈóÍó ÃóÈõæßó ÊóíúÓğÇ ãöäú Ûóäóãöåö ŞóØøõ ÚóÙöíãğÇ¿»</div><br>  (Has your father ever slaughtered a ram) The bedouin answered, `Yes,' and the Prophet asked him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÓóáóÎó ÅöåóÇÈóåõ İóÃóÚúØóÇåõ Ãõãøóßó İóŞóÇáó: ÇÊøóÎöĞöí áóäóÇ ãöäúåõ ÏóáúæğÇ¿»</div><br>  (And then he skinned it and gave the skin to your mother and asked her to make a hanging bucket out of it) The bedouin again said yes and said, `This grape would suffice for me and my family!' The Prophet agreed and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú¡ æóÚóÇãøóÉó ÚóÔöíÑóÊöß»</div><br>  (Yes, and also for the rest of your clan.)'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó ãóŞúØõæÚóÉò æóáÇó ãóãúäõæÚóÉò </div><br>  (Whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.) The supply of these fruits never runs out, winter or summer. Rather, they are always available for those who want to eat from them, forever. Whenever these fruits are desired, they will be available and easy to grasp by Allah's power. Qatadah said, "Nothing will prevent them from reaching out to get these fruits, no branches, thorns or distance.'' We mentioned a Hadith before that states that whenever someone takes a fruit in Paradise, another one grows in its place. Allah said, afterwards:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİõÑõÔò ãøóÑúİõæÚóÉò </div><br>  (And on couches, raised high.) meaning, high, soft and comfortable. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ ÃóäÔóÃúäóÜåõäøó ÅöäÔóÂÁğ - İóÌóÚóáúäóÜåõäøó ÃóÈúßóÜÑÇğ - ÚõÑõÈÇğ ÃóÊúÑóÇÈÇğ - áÇøğÕúÍóÜÈö Çáúíóãöíäö </div><br>  (Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins.`Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) The Ayat describe the women who will be on the beds and couches, but since mentioning the beds hints to them, they were not directly mentioned. For instance, Allah said that Sulayman said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ÚõÑöÖó Úóáóíúåö ÈöÇáúÚóÔöìøö ÇáÕøóÜİöäóÜÊõ ÇáúÌöíóÇÏõ - İóŞóÇáó Åöäøöì ÃóÍúÈóÈúÊõ ÍõÈøó ÇáúÎóíúÑö Úóä ĞößúÑö ÑóÈöì ÍóÊøóì ÊóæóÇÑóÊú ÈöÇáúÍöÌóÇÈö </div><br>  (When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well-trained horses of the highest breed. He said, "I did love the good instead of remembering my Lord,'' till the time was over, and it had hidden in the veil (of night).) (38:31-32), "it'' (Tawarat) refers to the sun setting, according to the scholars of Tafsir. Al-Akhfash said that Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ ÃóäÔóÃúäóÜåõäøó</div><br>  (Verily, We have created them), implied the maidens of Paradise although it did not mention them directly. Abu `Ubaydah said that they were mentioned before in Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍõæÑñ Úöíäñ - ßóÃóãúËóÜáö ÇááøõÄúáõÄö Çáúãóßúäõæäö </div><br>  (And Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. Like preserved pearls.)  Therefore, Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ ÃóäÔóÃúäóÜåõäøó</div><br>  (Verily, We have created them), meaning, in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÚúØóì ÇáúãõÄúãöäõ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ŞõæøóÉó ßóĞóÇ æóßóĞóÇ İöí ÇáäøöÓóÇÁ»</div><br>  (In Paradise, the believer will be given such and such strength for women.) Anas said, "I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Will one be able to do that' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÚúØóì ŞõæøóÉó ãöÇÆóÉ»</div><br>  (He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).)'' At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, "Sahih Gharib.'' Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah was asked, "O Allah's Messenger! Will we have sexual intercourse with our wives in Paradise'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáó áóíóÕöáõ İöí Çáúíóæúãö Åöáóì ãöÇÆóÉö ÚóĞúÑóÇÁ»</div><br>  (The man will be able to have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one day.) Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi said, "In my view, this Hadith meets the criteria of the Sahih, and Allah knows best.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚõÑõÈÇğ</div><br>  (`Urub,) Sa`id bin Jubayr reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "They are in an infatuated state with their husbands, haven't you ever seen a she-camel in heat She is like that.'' Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas who said, "The Urub and their husbands are their sweet hearts, and they are their husbands' sweet hearts.'' Similar was said by `Abdullah bin Sarjis, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, `Atiyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊúÑóÇÈÇğ</div><br>  (Atrab), means "They will be of one age, thirty-three years old.'' Mujahid said, "Equal (age).'' And in a different narration, "Similar (age).'' `Atiyah said, "Comparative.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøğÕúÍóÜÈö Çáúíóãöíäö </div><br>  (For those on the right.) meaning, these women were created, kept or given in marriage to those on the right. It appears that the meaning here is that they were created for those on the right side, because Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ ÃóäÔóÃúäóÜåõäøó ÅöäÔóÂÁğ - İóÌóÚóáúäóÜåõäøó ÃóÈúßóÜÑÇğ - ÚõÑõÈÇğ ÃóÊúÑóÇÈÇğ - áÇøğÕúÍóÜÈö Çáúíóãöíäö </div><br>  (Verily, We have created them a special creation. And made them virgins. `Urub, Atrab. For those on the right.) This is the view of Ibn Jarir. It is possible that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøğÕúÍóÜÈö Çáúíóãöíäö </div><br>  (For those on the right.) refers to the description that came just before,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚõÑõÈÇğ ÃóÊúÑóÇÈÇğ - áÇøğÕúÍóÜÈö Çáúíóãöíäö </div><br>  (Atrab. For those on the right.) meaning, in their age. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóæøóáõ ÒõãúÑóÉò íóÏúÎõáõæäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó Úóáóì ÕõæÑóÉö ÇáúŞóãóÑö áóíúáóÉó ÇáúÈóÏúÑö¡ æóÇáøóĞöíäó íóáõæäóåõãú Úóáóì ÖóæúÁö ÃóÔóÏøö ßóæúßóÈò ÏõÑøöíó İöí ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö ÅöÖóÇÁóÉğ¡ áóÇ íóÈõæáõæäó¡ æóáóÇ íóÊóÛóæøóØõæäó¡ æóáóÇ íóÊúİõáõæäó¡ æóáóÇ íóÊóãóÎøóØõæäó¡ ÃóãúÔóÇØõåõãõ ÇáĞøóåóÈõ¡ æóÑóÔúÍõåõãõ ÇáúãöÓúßõ¡ æóãóÌóÇãöÑõåõãõ ÇáúÃóáõæøóÉõ¡ æóÃóÒúæóÇÌõåõãõ ÇáúÍõæÑõ ÇáúÚöíäõ¡ ÃóÎúáóÇŞõåõãú Úóáóì ÎõáõŞö ÑóÌõáò æóÇÍöÏò¡ Úóáóì ÕõæÑóÉö ÃóÈöíåöãú ÂÏóãó¡ ÓöÊøõæäó ĞöÑóÇÚğÇ İöí ÇáÓøóãóÇÁ»</div><br>  (The first group to enter Paradise will be (shining) like the moon when it is full.

Their combs will be of gold and their sweat of musk; and censers of aloeswood will be used. Their wives will be from Al-Hur Al-`Ayn. Their shape will be similar to each other, the shape of their father `Adam, sixty cubits high in the sky.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ËõáøóÉñ ãøöäó ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó æóËõáøóÉñ ãøöäó ÇáÇøñÎöÑöíäó </div><br>  (A multitude of those will be from the first generation. And a multitude of those will be from the later generations.) means, a multitude of those on the right will come from the earlier generations and a multitude from the latter generations. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "We were with the Prophet one night and in the next morning we went to him and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÚõÑöÖóÊú Úóáóíøó ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁõ æóÃóÊúÈóÇÚõåóÇ ÈöÃõãóãöåóÇ¡ İóíóãõÑøõ Úóáóíøó ÇáäøóÈöíøõ¡ æóÇáäøóÈöíøõ İöí ÇáúÚöÕóÇÈóÉö¡ æóÇáäøóÈöíøõ İöí ÇáËøóáóÇËóÉö¡ æóÇáäøóÈöíøõ æóáóíúÓó ãóÚóåõ ÃóÍóÏ»</div><br>  (Some Prophets and their nations were displayed before me.
