He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ ãóÇ ÚóÈóÏúäóÇ ãöä Ïõæäöåö ãöä ÔóìúÁò äøóÍúäõ æóáÇ ÁóÇÈóÇÄõäóÇ æóáÇó ÍóÑøóãúäóÇ ãöä Ïõæäöåö ãöä ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  ((They say:) "If Allah had so willed, neither we nor our fathers would have worshipped any but Him, nor would we have forbidden anything without (a command from) Him.'') They had superstitious customs dealing with certain animals, e.g. the Bahirah the Sa'ibah and the Wasilah and other things that they had invented and innovated by themselves, with no revealed authority. The essence of what they said was: "If Allah hated what we did, He would have stopped by punishing us, and He would not have enabled us to do it.'' Rejecting their confusing ideas, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóáú Úóáóì ÇáÑøõÓõáö ÅöáÇøó ÇáúÈóáóÜÛõ ÇáúãõÈöíäõ</div><br>  (Are the Messengers charged with anything but to clearly convey the Message) meaning, the matter is not as you claim. It is not the case that Allah did not rebuke your behavior; rather, He did rebuke you, and in the strongest possible terms, and He emphatically forbade you from such behavior. To every nation - that is, to every generation, to every community of people - He sent a Messenger. All of the Messengers called their people to worship Allah (Alone) as well as forbidding them from worshipping anything or anybody except for Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäö ÇÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáúØøóÜÛõæÊó</div><br>  (Worship Allah (Alone), and shun the Taghut (all false deities).)  Allah continued sending Messengers to mankind with this Message, from the first incidence of Shirk that appeared among the Children of Adam, in the people to whom Nuh was sent - the first Messenger sent by Allah to the people of this earth - until He sent the final Messenger, Muhammad , whose call was addressed to both men and Jinn, in the east and in the west. All of the Messengers brought the same Message, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ãöä ÑøóÓõæáò ÅöáÇøó äõæÍöì Åöáóíúåö Ãóäøóåõ áÇ ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó ÃóäóÇú İóÇÚúÈõÏõæäö </div><br>  (And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): None has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah), so worship Me (alone and none else).'') (21:25)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúÆáú ãóäú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ãöä ÑøõÓõáöäóÂ ÃóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ãöä Ïõæäö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÁóÇáöåóÉğ íõÚúÈóÏõæäó </div><br>  (And ask (O Muhammad) those Messengers of Ours whom We sent before you: "Did We ever appointed to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious (Allah)'') (43:45) And in this Ayah, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÈóÚóËúäóÇ İöì ßõáøö ÃõãøóÉò ÑøóÓõæáÇğ Ãóäö ÇÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáúØøóÜÛõæÊó</div><br>  (And We have indeed sent a Messenger to every Ummah (community, nation) (saying): "Worship Allah (alone), and shun the Taghut (all false deities).'')  So how could any of the idolators say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ ãóÇ ÚóÈóÏúäóÇ ãöä Ïõæäöåö ãöä ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (If Allah had so willed, we would not have worshipped any but Him,) The legislative will of Allah is clear and cannot be taken as an excuse by them, because He had forbidden them to do that upon the tongue of His Messengers, but by His universal will i.e., by which He allows things to occur even though they do not please Him He allowed them to do that as it was decreed for them. So there is no argument in that for them. Allah created Hell and its people both the Shayatin (devils) and disbelievers, but He does not like His servants to disbelieve. And this point constitutes the strongest proof and the most unquestionable wisdom. Then Allah informs us that He rebuked them with punishment in this world, after the Messengers issued their warning, thus He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãöäúåõã ãøóäú åóÏóì Çááøóåõ æóãöäúåõãú ãøóäú ÍóŞøóÊú Úóáóíúåö ÇáÖøóáóÜáóÉõ İóÓöíÑõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö İóÇäÙõÑõæÇú ßóíúİó ßóÇäó ÚóÜŞöÈóÉõ ÇáúãõßóĞøöÈöíäó</div><br>  (Then among them were some whom Allah guided, and among them were some who deserved to be left to stray. So travel through the land and see the end of those who denied (the truth).) This means: ask about what happened to those who went against the Messengers and rejected the truth, see how:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏóãøóÑó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöãú æóáöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÃóãúËóÜáõåóÇ</div><br>  (Allah destroyed them completely, and a similar (end awaits) the disbelievers.)

If He wills a thing, then it happens, and if He does not will a thing, then it does not happen. For this reason Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóåúÏöì ãóä íõÖöáøõ</div><br>  (Allah does not guide those whom He allowed to stray,) meaning the one whom He has caused to go astray, so who can guide him apart from Allah No one.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ áóåõã ãøöä äøóÜÕöÑöíäó</div><br>  (And they will have no helpers.) means, they will have no one to save them from the punishment of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇó áóåõ ÇáúÎóáúŞõ æóÇáÇøñãúÑõ ÊóÈóÇÑóßó Çááøóåõ ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (Surely, His is the creation and commandment.
