Makkah is called Umm Al-Qura (the Mother of the Towns) because it is nobler than all other lands, as indicated by much evidence that has been discussed elsewhere. Among the most concise and clear proofs of that is the report recorded by Imam Ahmad from `Abdullah bin `Adi bin Al-Hamra' Az-Zuhri, who heard the Messenger of Allah say, as he was standing in the market place of Makkah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇááåö Åöäøóßö áóÎóíúÑõ ÃóÑúÖö Çááåö æóÃóÍóÈøõ ÃóÑúÖö Çááåö Åöáóì Çááåö¡ æóáóæúáóÇ Ãóäøöí ÃõÎúÑöÌúÊõ ãöäúßö ãóÇ ÎóÑóÌúÊ»</div><br>  (By Allah, you are the best land of Allah, the most beloved land to Allah; were it not for the fact that I was driven out from you, I would never have left you.) This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah; At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih. ''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊõäĞöÑó íóæúãó ÇáúÌóãúÚö</div><br>  (and warn (them) of the Day of Assembling) i.e., the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will assemble the first and the last in one plain.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÑóíúÈó İöíåö</div><br>  (of which there is no doubt,) means, there is no doubt that it will happen and will most certainly come to pass.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÑöíŞñ İöì ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóİóÑöíŞñ İöì ÇáÓøóÚöíÑö</div><br>  (a party will be in Paradise and a party in the blazing Fire.)

That is a Day whereon will be gathered together, and that is a Day when all (the dwellers of the heavens and the earth) will be present. And We delay it only for a term fixed. On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His leave. Some among them will be wretched and (others) blessed.) (11:103-105) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah came out to us, holding two books in his hand. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊóÏúÑõæäó ãóÇ åĞóÇäö ÇáúßöÊóÇÈóÇäö¿»</div><br>  (Do you know what these two books are) We said, "We do not know unless you tell us, O Messenger of Allah.'' Concerning the book in his right hand, He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóĞóÇ ßöÊóÇÈñ ãöäú ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÇáóãöíäó ÈöÃóÓúãóÇÁö Ãóåúáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóÃóÓúãóÇÁö ÂÈóÇÆöåöãú æóŞóÈóÇÆöáöåöãú¡ Ëõãøó ÃõÌúãöáó Úóáì ÂÎöÑöåöãú¡ áóÇ íõÒóÇÏõ İöíåöãú æóáóÇ íõäúŞóÕõ ãöäúåõãú ÃÈÏğÇ»</div><br>  (This is a book from the Lord of the worlds, containing the names of the people of Paradise and of their fathers and tribes; all of them are detailed, down to the last one of them, and nothing will be added or taken away from it.) Then concerning the book in his left hand, he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóĞóÇ ßöÊóÇÈõ Ãóåúáö ÇáäøóÇÑö ÈöÃóÓúãóÇÆöåöãú æóÃóÓúãóÇÁö ÂÈóÇÆöåöãú æóŞóÈóÇÆöáöåöãú¡ Ëõãøó ÃõÌúãöáó Úóáì ÂÎöÑöåöãú¡ áóÇ íõÒóÇÏõ İöíåöãú æóáóÇ íõäúŞóÕõ ãöäúåõãú ÃóÈóÏğÇ»</div><br>  (This is the book of the people of Hell, containing their names and the names of their fathers and tribes, all of them are detailed down to the last one of them, and nothing will be added or taken away from it.) The Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, "Why should we strive if it is something that is already cut and dried'' The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóÏøöÏõæÇ æóŞóÇÑöÈõæÇ İóÅöäøó ÕóÇÍöÈó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö íõÎúÊóãõ áóåõ ÈöÚóãóáö Ãóåúáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóÅöäú Úóãöáó Ãóíøó Úóãóáò¡æóÅöäøó ÕóÇÍöÈó ÇáäøóÇÑö íõÎúÊóãõ áóåõ ÈöÚóãóáö Ãóåúáö ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ æóÅöäú Úóãöáó Ãóíøó Úóãóá»</div><br>  (Strive with your deeds as hard as you can for middle course or close to it, for the person who is destined for Paradise will die doing the deeds of the people of Paradise, regardless of what he did before, and the person who is destined for Hell will die doing the deeds of the people of Hell, regardless of what he did before.) Then he made a gesture with his fist and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÑóÛó ÑóÈøõßõãú ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó ãöäó ÇáúÚöÈóÇÏ»</div><br>  (Your Lord has settled the matter of His servants) and he opened his right hand as if throwing something;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÑöíŞñ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (A party in Paradise.) and he made a similar gesture with his left hand;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÑöíŞñ İöí ÇáÓøóÚöíÑ»</div><br>  (And a party in the blazing Fire.)'' This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i; At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih Gharib.''  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Nadrah said, "One of the Companions of the Prophet , whose name was Abu Abdullah, was visited by some of his friends, and they found him weeping. They asked him, `What has caused you to weep Didn't the Messenger of Allah say to you,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÎõĞú ãöäú ÔóÇÑöÈößó Ëõãøó ÃóŞöÑøóåõ ÍóÊøóì ÊóáúŞóÇäöí»</div><br>  (Trim your moustache and adhere to that practice until you meet me)' He said, `Yes, but I heard the Messenger of Allah say;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì ŞóÈóÖó Èöíóãöíäöåö ŞóÈúÖóÉğ æóÃõÎúÑóì ÈöÇáúíóÏö ÇáúÃõÎúÑóì¡ ŞóÇáó: åĞöåö áöåĞöåö¡ æóåĞöåö áöåĞöåö¡ æóáóÇ ÃõÈóÇáöí»</div><br>  (Allah picked up a handful in His Right Hand and another in His other Hand, and said, "This is for this and this is for this, and I do not care.'') `And I do not know in which of the two handfuls I am.''' There are several Hadiths about Al-Qadr (the Divine Decree) in the books of Sahih, Sunan and Musnad. Including those narrated by `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, `A'ishah and a large number of Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ áóÌóÚóáóåõãú ÃõãøóÉğ æóÍöÏóÉğ</div><br>  (And if Allah had willed, He could have made them one nation,) means, either all following guidance or all following misguidance, but He made them all different, and He guides whomsoever He wills to the truth and He sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He has complete wisdom and perfect proof.
