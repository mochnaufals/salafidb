In the Two Sahihs it is reported from Abu Musa that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó áóíõãúáöí áöáÙøóÇáöãö ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÎóĞóåõ áóãú íõİúáöÊúå»</div><br>  (Allah lets the wrongdoer carry on until, when He seizes him, He will never let him go.)

Something similar was narrated from `Ali bin Abi Talib, Mujahid, `Ata', Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Al-Mulayh and Ad-Dahhak. Others said that it means high and impenetrable fortresses. All of these suggestions are close in meaning and do not contradict one another, for this sturdy construction and great height did not help their occupants or afford them any protection when the punishment of Allah came upon them, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíúäóãóÇ ÊóßõæäõæÇú íõÏúÑößßøõãõ ÇáúãóæúÊõ æóáóæú ßõäÊõãú İöì ÈõÑõæÌò ãøõÔóíøóÏóÉò</div><br>  ("Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in Buruj Mushayyadah!'') 4:78   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóİóáóãú íóÓöíÑõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Have they not traveled through the land,) means, have they not traveled in the physical sense and also used their minds to ponder That is sufficient, as Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya said in his book At-Tafakkur wal-I`tibar, "Some of the wise people said, `Give life to your heart with lessons, illuminate it with thought, kill it with asceticism, strengthen it with certain faith, remind it of its mortality, make it aware of the calamities of this world, warn it of the disasters that life may bring, show it how things may suddenly change with the passing of days, tell it the stories of the people of the past, and remind it what happened to those who came before.''' Walk through their ruins, see what they did and what became of them, meaning, look at the punishments and divine wrath that struck the nations of the past who belied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóßõæäó áóåõãú ŞõáõæÈñ íóÚúŞöáõæäó ÈöåóÂ Ãóæú ÁóÇĞóÇäñ íóÓúãóÚõæäó ÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (and have they hearts wherewith to understand and ears wherewith to hear) meaning, let them learn a lesson from that.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóåóÇ áÇó ÊóÚúãóì ÇáÇøñÈúÕóÜÑõ æóáóÜßöä ÊóÚúãóì ÇáúŞõáõæÈõ ÇáøóÊöì İöì ÇáÕøõÏõæÑö</div><br>  (Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.) means, the blind person is not the one whose eyes cannot see, but rather the one who has no insight. Even if the physical eyes are sound, they still cannot learn the lesson.  </div></body></html>
