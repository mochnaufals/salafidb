This is similar to His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÏöãúäóÂ Åöáóì ãóÇ ÚóãöáõæÇú ãöäú Úóãóáò İóÌóÚóáúäóÇåõ åóÈóÂÁğ ãøóäËõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (And We will approach what they have done of deeds and make them as dispersed dust.) (25:23) Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÇÊö</div><br>  (And those who believe and do righteous good deeds,) Which means that their hearts and souls have believed, and their limbs and their hidden and apparent acts have complied with Allah's Law.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÈöãóÇ äõÒøöáó Úóáóì ãõÍóãøóÏò</div><br>  (And believe in that which has been sent down to Muhammad) Adding this statement to the previous one is a method of adding a specific meaning to a general one. This provides proof that after Muhammad's advent, believing in him is a required condition for the true faith. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáúÍóŞøõ ãöä ÑøóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  (For it is the truth from their Lord.) which is a beautifully placed parenthetical clause. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóİøóÑó Úóäúåõãú ÓóíøöÆóÜÊöåöãú æóÃóÕúáóÍó ÈóÇáóåõãú</div><br>  (He expiates from them their sins and amends their Bal.) Ibn `Abbas, said, "This means their matter.'' Mujahid said, "This means their affair.'' Qatadah and Ibn Zayd both said, "Their condition.'' And all of these are similar in meaning. It has been mentioned (from the Prophet ) in the Hadith of the responding to one who sneezes,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóåúÏöíßõãõ Çááåõ æóíõÕúáöÍõ ÈóÇáóßõã»</div><br>  (May Allah guide you and rectify your (Bal) affairs.) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÈöÃóäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÇÊøóÈóÚõæÇú ÇáúÈóÜØöáó</div><br>  (That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood,) meaning, `We only invalidate the deeds of the disbelievers and overlook the sins of the righteous, and amend their affairs, because those who disbelieve follow false- hood.' Meaning, they choose falsehood over the truth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÇÊøóÈóÚõæÇú ÇáúÍóŞøó ãöä ÑøóÈøöåöãú ßóĞóáößó íóÖúÑöÈõ Çááøóåõ áöáäøóÇÓö ÃóãúËóÜáóåõãú</div><br>  (while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus does Allah set forth for the people their parables.) Thus He makes the consequence of their actions clear to them, and He shows them where they will end in their next life -- and Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
