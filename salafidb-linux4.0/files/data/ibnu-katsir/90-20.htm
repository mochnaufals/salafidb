Imam Ahmad recorded from Sa`id bin Marjanah that he heard Abu Hurayrah saying that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóÚúÊóŞó ÑóŞóÈóÉğ ãõÄãöäóÉğ ÃóÚúÊóŞó Çááåõ Èößõáøö ÅöÑúÈò Ãóíú ÚõÖúæò ãöäúåóÇ ÅöÑúÈğÇ ãöäúåõ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö ÍóÊúì Åöäøóåõ áóíõÚúÊöŞõ ÈöÇáúíóÏö ÇáúíóÏó¡ æóÈöÇáÑøöÌúáö ÇáÑøöÌúáó¡ æóÈöÇáúİóÑúÌö ÇáúİóÑúÌ»</div><br>  (Whoever frees a believing slave, Allah will free for every limb (of the slave) one of his limbs from the Fire. This is to such an extent that He (Allah) will free a hand for a hand, a leg for a leg, and a private part for a private part.) `Ali bin Al-Husayn then said (to Sa`id), "Did you hear this from Abu Hurayrah'' Sa`id replied, "Yes.'' Then `Ali bin Al-Husayn said to a slave boy that he owned who was the swiftest of his servants, "Call Mutarrif!'' So when the slave was brought before him he said, "Go, for you are free for the Face of Allah.'' Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, all recorded this Hadith from Sa`id bin Marjanah. Imam Ahmad recorded from `Amr bin `Abasah that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Èóäóì ãóÓúÌöÏğÇ áöíõĞúßóÑó Çááúåõ İöíåö Èóäóì Çááúåõ áóåõ ÈóíúÊğÇ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóãóäú ÃóÚúÊóŞó äóİúÓğÇ ãõÓúáöãóÉğ ßóÇäóÊú İöÏúíóÊóåõ ãöäú Ìóåóäøóãó æóãóäú ÔóÇÈó ÔóíúÈóÉğ İöí ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãö ßóÇäóÊú áóåõ äõæÑğÇ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (Whoever builds a Masjid so that Allah may be remembered in it, Allah will build a house for him in Paradise; and whoever frees a Muslim person, then it will be his ransom from Hell; and whoever grows grey in Islam, then it will be a light for him on the Day of Judgement.) According to another route of transmission, Ahmad recorded from Abu Umamah, who reported from `Amr bin `Abasah that As-Sulami said to him, "Narrate a Hadith to us that you heard from the Messenger of Allah , without any deficiency or mistakes.'' He (`Amr) said, "I heard him saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú æõáöÏó áóåõ ËóáóÇËóÉõ ÃóæúáóÇÏò İöí ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãö İóãóÇÊõæÇ ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú íóÈúáõÛõæÇ ÇáúÍöäúËó ÃóÏúÎóáóåõ Çááåõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ÈöİóÖúáö ÑóÍúãóÊöåö ÅöíøóÇåõãú¡ æóãóäú ÔóÇÈó ÔóíúÈóÉğ İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö ßóÇäóÊú áóåõ äõæÑğÇ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ æóãóäú Ñóãóì ÈöÓóåúã İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö ÈóáóÛó Èöåö ÇáúÚóÏõæøó ÃóÕóÇÈó Ãóæú ÃóÎúØóÃó ßóÇäó áóåõ ÚöÊúŞõ ÑóŞóÈóÉò¡ æóãóäú ÃóÚúÊóŞó ÑóŞóÈóÉğ ãõÄúãöäóÜÉğ ÃóÚúÊóŞó Çááåõ Èößõáøö ÚõÖúæò ãöäúåõ ÚõÖúæğÇ ãöäúåõ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ æóãóäú ÃóäúİóŞó ÒóæúÌóíúäö İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö İóÅöäøó áöáúÌóäøóÉö ËóãóÇäöíóÉó ÃóÈúæóÇÈò íõÏúÎöáõåõ Çááåõ ãöäú Ãóíøö ÈóÇÈò ÔóÇÁó ãöäúåóÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever has three children born to him in Islam, and they die before reaching the age of puberty, Allah will enter him into Paradise by virtue of His mercy to them. And whoever grows gray in the way of Allah (fighting Jihad), then it will be a light for him on the Day of Judgement. And whoever shoots an arrow in the way of Allah (fighting Jihad) that reaches the enemy, whether it hits or misses, he will get the reward of freeing a slave. And whoever frees a believing slave, then Allah will free each of his limbs from the Fire for every limb that the slave has. And whoever equipped two riding animals in the way of Allah (for fighting Jihad), then indeed Paradise has eight gates, and Allah will allow him to enter any of them he choses.)'' Ahmad recorded this Hadith from different routes of transmission that are good and strong, and all praise is due to Allah.Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÅöØúÚóÇãñ İöì íóæúãò Ğöì ãóÓúÛóÈóÉò </div><br>  (Or giving food in a day full of Masghabah,) Ibn `Abbas said, "Of hunger.'' `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others all said the same. The word `Saghb' means hunger. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÊöíãÇğ</div><br>  (To an orphan) meaning, he gives food on a day like this to an orphan.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ĞóÇ ãóŞúÑóÈóÉò</div><br>  (near of kin.) meaning, who is related to him. Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi all said this. This is similar to what was related in a Hadith that was collected by Imam Ahmad on the authority of Salman bin `Amir who said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉõ Úóáóì ÇáúãöÓúßöíäö ÕóÏóŞóÉñ æóÚóáóì Ğöí ÇáÑøóÍöãö ÇËúäóÊóÇäö: ÕóÏóŞóÉñ æóÕöáóÉ»</div><br>  (Charity given to the poor person is counted as one charity, while if it is given to a relative it is counted as two: charity and connecting the ties (of kinship).) At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i both recorded this Hadith and its chain of narration is authentic. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ãöÓúßöíäÇğ ĞóÇ ãóÊúÑóÈóÉò </div><br>  (Or to a Miskin cleaving to dust (Dha Matrabah).) meaning, poor, miserable, and clinging to the dirt. It means those who are in a state of destitution. Ibn `Abbas said, "Dha Matrabah is that who is dejected in the street and who has no house or anything else to protect him against the dirt.'' Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ßóÇäó ãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú</div><br>  (Then he became one of those who believed) meaning, then, along with these beautiful and pure characteristics, he was a believer in his heart, seeking the reward of that from Allah.

This is similar to what has been related in the noble Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÑøóÇÍöãõæäó íóÑúÍóãõåõãõ ÇáÑøóÍúãäõ¡ ÇÑúÍóãõæÇ ãóäú İöí ÇáúÃóÑúÖö íóÑúÍóãúßõãú ãóäú İöí ÇáÓøóãóÇÁ»</div><br>  (The merciful people will be treated with mercy by the Most Merciful (Allah). Be merciful to those who are on the earth and He Who is above the heavens will be merciful to you.) In another Hadith he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóÑúÍóãõ Çááåõ ãóäú áóÇ íóÑúÍóãö ÇáäøóÇÓ»</div><br>  (Allah will not be merciful with whoever is not merciful with the people.) Abu Dawud recorded from `Abdullah bin `Amr that he narrated (from the Prophet ),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú áóãú íóÑúÍóãú ÕóÛöíÑóäóÇ æóíóÚúÑöİú ÍóŞøó ßóÈöíÑöäóÇ İóáóíúÓó ãöäøóÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever does not show mercy to our children, nor does he recognize the right of our elders, then he is not of us.)

Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi, all said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõÄúÕóÏóÉõ</div><br>  (Mu'sadah.) "This means shut.'' Ibn `Abbas said, "Its doors will be closed.'' Ad-Dahhak said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõÄúÕóÏóÉõ</div><br>  (Mu'sadah.) "It will be sealed over them and it will have no door.'' Qatadah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõÄúÕóÏóÉõ</div><br>  (Mu'sadah.) "It will be shut and there will be no light in it, no crevice (escape), and no way out of it forever.'' This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Balad, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
