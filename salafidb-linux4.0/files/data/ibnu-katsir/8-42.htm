You the companions had no knowledge this would happen, but it was out of Allah's compassion that He did that.'' In a Hadith, Ka`b bin Malik said, "The Messenger of Allah and the Muslims marched to intercept the Quraysh caravan, but Allah made them meet their (armed) enemy without appointment.'' Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Yazid bin Ruwman narrated to him that `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said, "Upon approaching Badr, the Messenger of Allah sent `Ali bin Abi Talib, Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas, Az-Zubayr bin Al-`Awwam and several other Companions to spy the pagans. They captured two boys, a servant of Bani Sa`id bin Al-`As and a servant of Bani Al-Hajjaj, while they were bringing water for Quraysh. So they brought them to the Messenger of Allah , but found him praying. The Companions started interrogating the boys, asking them to whom they belonged. Both of them said that they were employees bringing water for Quraysh (army). The Componions were upset with that answer, since they thought that the boys belonged to Abu Sufyan (who was commanding the caravan). So they beat the two boys vehemently, who said finally that they belonged to Abu Sufyan. Thereupon companions left them alone. When the Prophet ended the prayer, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅóĞóÇ ÕóÏøóŞóÇßõãú ÖóÑóÈúÊõãõæåõãóÇ¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ßóĞøóÈóÇßõãú ÊóÑóßúÊõãõæåõãóÇ¡ ÕóÏóŞóÇ æóÇááåö ÅöäøóåõãóÇ áöŞõÑóíúÔò ¡ ÃóÎúÈöÑóÇäöí Úóäú ŞõÑóíúÔ»</div><br>  (When they tell you the truth you beat them, but when they lie you let them go They have said the truth, by Allah! They belong to the Quraysh. (addressing to the boys He said:) Tell me the news about Quraysh.)  The two boys said, `They are behind this hill that you see, on the far side of the valley.' The Messenger of Allah asked,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóãö ÇáúŞóæúãõ¿»</div><br>  (How many are they)  They said, `They are many.' He asked,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇÚõÏøóÊõåõãú¿»</div><br>  (How many) They said, `We do not know the precise number.' He asked,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóãú íóäúÍóÑõæäó ßõáøó íóæúãò¿»</div><br>  (How many camels do they slaughter every day)  They said, `Nine or ten a day.'

This is a sound explanation. Allah says, He made you meet your enemy in one area without appointment, so that He gives you victory over them.' This way, `He will raise the word of truth above falsehood, so that the matter is made clear, the proof unequivocal and the evidence plain. Then there will be no more plea or doubt for anyone. Then, those destined to destruction by persisting in disbelief do so with evidence, aware that they are misguided and that proof has been established against them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÍúíóì ãóäú Íóìøó</div><br>  (and those who were to live might live), those who wish to believe do so,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóä ÈóíøöäóÉò</div><br>  (after a clear evidence), and proof.
