And We sent no Prophet unto any town (and they denied him), but We seized its people with Ba'sa' and Darra', so that they might humble themselves (to Allah).) (95. Then We changed the evil for the good, until they `Afaw (increased), and said: "Our fathers were touched with evil and with good.'' So We seized them all of a sudden while they were unaware.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Afflictions that struck Earlier Nations</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah mentions the Ba'sa' and Darra' that struck the earlier nations to whom He sent Prophets. Ba'sa', refers to the physical sicknesses and ailments that they suffered, while Darra', refers to the poverty and humiliation that they experienced,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóåõãú íóÖøóÑøóÚõæäó</div><br>  (so that they might humble themselves) supplicate, humble themselves and invoke Allah, that He might remove the afflictions that they suffered from. This Ayah indicates that Allah sent down severe afflictions to them so that they might invoke Him, but they did not do what He ordered them. Therefore, He changed the affliction into prosperity to test them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÈóÏøóáúäóÇ ãóßóÇäó ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÉö ÇáúÍóÓóäóÉó</div><br>  (Then We changed the evil for the good,) Therefore, Allah changed the hardship into prosperity, disease and sickness into health and well-being, and poverty into richness in provision, so that they might be thankful to Allah for this, but they did none of that. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÚóİóæÇú</div><br>  (until they `Afaw) refers to increase in numbers, wealth and offspring. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æøóŞóÇáõæÇú ŞóÏú ãóÓøó ÁóÇÈóÇÁóäóÇ ÇáÖøóÑøóÂÁõ æóÇáÓøóÑøóÂÁõ İóÃóÎóĞúäóÜåõãú ÈóÛúÊóÉğ æóåõãú áÇó íóÔúÚõÑõæäó</div><br>  (. . and they said: "Our fathers were touched with evil and with good.'' So We seized them all of a sudden while they were unaware.) He tested them with this (afflictions) and that (ease and abundance) so that they may humble themselves and repent to Him. However, they failed both tests, for neither this nor that compelled them to change their ways. They said, "We suffered Ba'sa' and Darra', but prosperity came afterwards, just as like our forefathers in earlier times.'' "Therefore,'' they said, "it is a cycle where we sometimes suffer a hardship and at other times, we enjoy a bounty.''  However, they did not comprehend Allah's wisdom, nor the fact that He is testing them in both cases. To the contrary, the believers are grateful to Allah in good times and practice patience in hard times. In the Sahih, there is a Hadith that says;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÚóÌóÈğÇ áöáúãõÄúãöäö áóÇ íóŞúÖöí Çááåõ áóåõ ŞóÖóÇÁğ ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóåõ¡ æóÅöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóÊúåõ ÖóÑøóÇÁõ ÕóÈóÑó İóßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóåõ¡ æóÅöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóÊúåõ ÓóÑøóÇÁõ ÔóßóÑó İóßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóå»</div><br>  (The matter of the believer is amazing, for nothing that Allah decrees for him, but it is better for him. If a Darra' (harm) strikes him, he is patient, and this is better for him, if he is given Sarra' (prosperity), he thanks (Allah) for it and this is better for him.) The believer, therefore, is aware of the test behind the afflictions whether it may be prosperity or adversity that Allah sends to him, as well as the blessings. Similarly, in another Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇíóÒóÇáõ ÇáúÈóáóÇÁõ ÈöÇáúãõÄúãöäö ÍóÊøóì íóÎúÑõÌó äóŞöíøğÇ ãöäú ĞõäõæÈöåö¡æóÇáúãõäóÇİöŞ ãöËúáå ßóãóËóáö ÇáúÍöãóÇÑö áóÇ íóÏúÑöí İöíãó ÑóÈóØóåõ Ãóåúáõåõ æóáóÇ İöíãó ÃóÑúÓóáõæå»</div><br>  (The believer will continue to be tested by afflictions until he ends up pure from sin. And the parable of the hypocrite is that of a donkey, it does not know why its owners tied it or released it.) Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÎóĞúäóÜåõãú ÈóÛúÊóÉğ æóåõãú áÇó íóÔúÚõÑõæäó</div><br>  (So We seized them all of a sudden while they were unaware.) meaning, We struck them with punishment all of a sudden, while they were unaware. A Hadith describes sudden death,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóæúÊõ ÇáúİóÌúÃóÉö ÑóÍúãóÉñ áöáúãõÄúãöäö æóÃóÎúĞóÉõ ÃóÓóİò áöáúßóÇİöÑ»</div><br>  (Sudden death is a mercy for the believer, but a sorrowful punishment for the disbeliever.)  </div></body></html>
