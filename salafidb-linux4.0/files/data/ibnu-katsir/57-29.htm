There is an Ayah in Surat Al-Qasas to support this meaning. Also, there is a Hadith from Ash-Sha`bi from Abu Burdah from his father from Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ËóáóÇËóÉñ íõÄúÊóæúäó ÃóÌúÑóåõãú ãóÑøóÊóíúäö: ÑóÌõáñ ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúßöÊóÇÈö Âãóäó ÈöäóÈöíøöåö æóÂãóäó Èöí İóáóåõ ÃóÌúÑóÇäö¡ æóÚóÈúÏñ ãóãúáõæßñ ÃóÏøóì ÍóŞøó Çááåö æóÍóŞøó ãóæóÇáöíåö İóáóåõ ÃóÌúÑóÇäö¡ æóÑóÌõáñ ÃóÏøóÈó ÃóãóÊóåõ İóÃóÍúÓóäó ÊóÃúÏöíÈóåóÇ¡ Ëõãøó ÃóÚúÊóŞóåóÇ æóÊóÒóæøóÌóåóÇ İóáóåõ ÃóÌúÑóÇä»</div><br>  (Three will get their reward twice. A believer from the People of the Scriptures who has been a true believer in his Prophet and then believes in me, will get a double reward. A slave who fulfills Allah's rights and obligations as well as the duties of his master, will get a double reward. A person who has a slave-girl and he educates her properly and teaches her good manners properly (without violence) and then manumits and marries her, will get a double reward.) This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Ad-Dahhak, `Utbah bin Abi Hakim and others agreed with Ibn `Abbas in this, and Ibn Jarir preferred it. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íöÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú Åóä ÊóÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó íóÌúÚóá áøóßõãú İõÑúŞóÇäğÇ æóíõßóİøöÑú Úóäßõãú ÓóíøöÆóÇÊößõãú æóíóÛúİöÑú áóßõãú æóÇááøóåõ Ğõæ ÇáúİóÖúáö ÇáúÚóÙöíãö </div><br>  (O you who believe! If you have Taqwa of Allah, He will grant you a criterion, and will expiate for you your sins, and forgive you; and Allah is Owner of the great bounty.)(8:29) Sa`id bin `Abdul-`Aziz said, `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked a Jewish rabbi, `What is the maximum a reward would be increased for you' He replied, `A Kifl (portion) which is about three hundred and fifty good merits.' So `Umar said, `Praise be to Allah who gave us two Kifls.' Then Sa`id mentioned Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÄúÊößõãú ßöİúáóíúäö ãöä ÑøóÍúãóÊöåö</div><br>  (He will give you a double portion of His mercy,) Sa`id said, "And the two Kifls on Friday are similar to that.'' This was recorded by Ibn Jarir.  This view has support from the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin `Umar that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóËóáõßõãú æóãóËóáõ ÇáúíóåõæÏö æóÇáäøóÕóÇÑóì ßóãóËóáö ÑóÌõáò ÇÓúÊóÚúãóáó ÚõãøóÇáğÇ İóŞóÇáó: ãóäú íóÚúãóáõ áöí ãöäú ÕóáóÇÉö ÇáÕøõÈúÍö Åöáóì äöÕúİö ÇáäøóåóÇÑö Úóáóì ŞöíÑóÇØò ŞöíÑóÇØò¿ ÃóáóÇ İóÚóãöáóÊö ÇáúíóåõæÏõ¡ Ëõãøó ŞóÇáó: ãóäú íóÚúãóáõ áöí ãöäú ÕóáóÇÉö ÇáÙøõåúÑö Åöáóì ÕóáóÇÉö ÇáúÚóÕúÑö Úóáóì ŞöíÑóÇØò ŞöíÑóÇØò¿ ÃóáóÇ İóÚóãöáóÊö ÇáäøóÕóÇÑóì¡ Ëõãøó ŞóÇáó: ãóäú íóÚúãóáõ áöí ãöäú ÕóáóÇÉö ÇáúÚóÕúÑö Åöáóì ÛõÑõæÈö ÇáÔøóãúÓö Úóáóì ŞöíÑóÇØóíúäö ŞöíÑóÇØóíúäö¿ ÃóáóÇ İóÃóäúÊõãõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÚóãöáúÊõãú¡ İóÛóÖöÈó ÇáäøóÕóÇÑóì æóÇáúíóåõæÏõ æóŞóÇáõæÇ: äóÍúäõ ÃóßúËóÑõ ÚóãóáğÇ æóÃóŞóáøõ ÚóØóÇÁğ¡ ŞóÇáó: åóáú ÙóáóãúÊõßõãú ãöäú ÃóÌúÑößõãú ÔóíúÆğÇ¿ ŞóÇáõæÇ: áóÇ¡ ŞóÇáó: İóÅöäøóãóÇ åõæó İóÖúáöí ÃõæÊöíåö ãóäú ÃóÔóÇÁ»</div><br>  (The parable of you and the Jews and Christians is that of a person who employed some laborers and asked them, "Who will work for me from the Dawn prayer until midday for one Qirat (a special weight of gold) each'' So, the Jews worked.

Then the person asked, "Who will do the work for me from `Asr prayer until sunset for two Qirat each'' You are those who did this work. The Jews and the Christians got angry and said, "We did more work, but got less wages.'' Allah said, "Have I been unjust to you with your reward'' They said, "No.'' So, Allah said, "Then it is My grace which I bestow on whomever I will.'') Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith.

So, they worked until midday and said, `We are not in need of the wages that you promised and our work was in vain.' So, the man said, `Do not quit now, complete the rest of the work and yours will be the full wage I have fixed for it.' However, they refused and quit, and he had to hire another batch of workers. He said (to the second batch), `Complete the work for the rest of the day and I will give you the same wage I promised the first batch.' So, they worked until the time of the `Asr prayer and said, `Whatever we have done is in vain and we forfeit the wages you promised us.' He said to them, `Complete your day's work, for only a small part of the day remains.' However, they refused, and he employed another batch to work for the rest of the day, and they worked until sunset and received the wages of the two former batches. This is an example of them (i.e., the Jews and Christians) and of those who accepted this light (i.e., Islam).) Al-Bukhari was alone in recording it.
