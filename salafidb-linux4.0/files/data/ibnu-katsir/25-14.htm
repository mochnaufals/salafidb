Their excuse was, as they said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ áöåóÜĞóÇ ÇáÑøóÓõæáö íóÃúßõáõ ÇáØøóÚóÇãó</div><br>  (Why does this Messenger eat food,) meaning, `as we eat, and why does he need food as we need it'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóãúÔöì İöì ÇáÇøñÓúæóÇŞö</div><br>  (and walk about in the markets.) means, he walks around and goes there often seeking to trade and earn a living.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæúáÇ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúåö ãóáóßñ İóíóßõæäó ãóÚóåõ äóĞöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (Why is not an angel sent down to him to be a warner with him) They were saying: why doesn't an angel come down to him from Allah, to be a witness that what he is claiming is true This is like when Fira`wn said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóæúáÇó ÃõáúŞöìó Úóáóíúåö ÃóÓúæöÑóÉñ ãøöä ĞóåóÈò Ãóæú ÌóÂÁó ãóÚóåõ ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ ãõŞúÊóÑöäöíäó </div><br>  ("Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him, or angels sent along with him'') (43:53). These people had a similar mentality and said the same kind of thing. They said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú íõáúŞóì Åöáóíúåö ßóäúÒñ</div><br>  (Or (why) has not a treasure been granted to him) meaning, treasure that he could spend on his needs and wants.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú Êóßõæäõ áóåõ ÌóäøóÉñ íóÃúßõáõ ãöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (or why has he not a garden whereof he may eat) meaning, a garden that would go with him wherever he went. All of this is easy for Allah, but He had a reason for not doing any of these things, and with Him is the perfect proof and argument.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ÇáÙøóÜáöãõæäó Åöä ÊóÊøóÈöÚõæäó ÅöáÇøó ÑóÌõáÇğ ãøóÓúÍõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (And the wrongdoers say: "You follow none but a man bewitched.'')

Everyone who has the slightest understanding will recognize that they are lying. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İõÖøöáõæÇú</div><br>  (so they have gone astray) from the path of guidance.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó íóÓúÊóØöíÚúæäó ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (and they cannot find a path.) Everyone who steps outside of the way of truth and guidance has gone astray, no matter what direction he takes, because the truth is one and its methodology is unified, parts of it confirming other parts. Then Allah tells His Prophet that if He willed, He could bestow on him in this world something far better than what they were saying. He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÈóÇÑóßó ÇáøóĞöì Åöä ÔóÂÁó ÌóÚóáó áóßó ÎóíúÑÇğ ãøöä Ğáößó</div><br>  (Blessed be He Who, if He wills, will assign you better than (all) that...) Mujahid said, "This means in this world.'' And he said: "The Quraysh used to call every house that was made of stone a `palace', whether it was large or small.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ßóĞøóÈõæÇú ÈöÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö</div><br>  (Nay, they deny the Hour,) means, they say this in stubborn disbelief, not because they are seeking insight and guidance, but because their disbelief in the Day of Resurrection makes them say what they say.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÚúÊóÏúäóÇ</div><br>  (And We have prepared) means, `We have made ready,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöãóä ßóĞøóÈó ÈöÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÓóÚöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (for those who deny the Hour, a flaming Fire.) means, an unbearably hot and painful torment in the fire of Hell.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóÊúåõãú</div><br>  (When it sees them) means, when Hell sees them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ãøóßóÇäö ÈóÚöíÏò</div><br>  (from a far place,) means from the place of gathering (on the Day of Resurrection),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóãöÚõæÇú áóåóÇ ÊóÛóíøõÙÇğ æóÒóİöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (they will hear its raging and its roaring.) means, (it will make those sounds) out of hatred towards them. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÂ ÃõáúŞõæÇú İöíåóÇ ÓóãöÚõæÇú áóåóÇ ÔóåöíŞğÇ æóåöìó ÊóİõæÑõ ÊóßóÇÏõ ÊóãóíøóÒõ ãöäó ÇáÛóíúÙö</div><br>  (When they are cast therein, they will hear the (terrible) drawing in of its breath as it blazes forth. It almost bursts up with fury) (67:7-8), which means that parts of it almost separate from other parts because of its intense hatred towards those who disbelieved in Allah. Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir narrated that Ibn `Abbas said: "A man will be dragged towards Hell, which will be expanding and contracting, and Ar-Rahman will say to it: `What is the matter with you' It will say: `He is seeking refuge from me.' So Allah will say, `Let My servant go.' Another man will be dragged towards Hell and he will say, `O Lord, I never expected this from You.' Allah will say, `What did you expect' The man will say, `I expected that Your mercy would be great enough to include me.' So Allah will say, `Let My servant go.' Another man will be dragged towards Hell, and Hell will bray at him like a donkey braying at barley. Then it will give a moan that will instill fear in everyone.'' Its chain of narrators is Sahih.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóãöÚõæÇú áóåóÇ ÊóÛóíøõÙÇğ æóÒóİöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (they will hear its raging and its roaring. ) `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Ubayd bin `Umayr said: "Hell will utter a moan such that there will be no angel who is close to Allah and no Prophet sent to mankind, but he will fall on his face, shaking all over. Even Ibrahim, peace be upon him, will fall to his knees and say: `O Lord, I do not ask You for salvation this Day except for myself.'''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅóĞóÂ ÃõáúŞõæÇú ãöäúåóÇ ãóßóÇäÇğ ÖóíøöŞÇğ ãøõŞóÑøóäöíäó</div><br>  (And when they shall be thrown into a narrow place thereof, chained together,) Qatadah narrated from Abu Ayyub that `Abdullah bin `Amr said: "Like the point of a spear, i.e., in its narrowness.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõŞúÑöäöíäó</div><br>  (chained together,) Abu Salih said, "This means, tied from their shoulders.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏóÚóæúÇú åõäóÇáößó ËõÈõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (they will exclaim therein for destruction.) means, they will utter cries of woe, regret and sorrow.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó ÊóÏúÚõæÇú Çáúíóæúãó ËõÈõæÑÇğ æóÍöÏÇğ</div><br>  (Exclaim not today for one destruction...)  </div></body></html>
