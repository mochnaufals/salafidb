This was said by Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóßõæäõ ÇáúÌöÈóÇáõ ßóÇáúÚöåúäö ÇáúãóäİõæÔö </div><br>  (And the mountains will be like carded wool.)

Meaning, no close friend will ask his close friend about his condition while he sees him in the worst of conditions. He will be worried about himself and will not be able to think of others. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, "Some of them will know others and they will be acquainted with each other.

By no means!) means, no ransom will be accepted from him even if he brought all of the people of the earth (as ransom), and the greatest wealth that he could find, even if it was enough gold to fill the entire earth. Even the child that he had who was dearer to him than the last beat of his heart in the life of this world, he would wish to use the child as a ransom for himself against the torment of Allah on the Day of Judgement when he sees the horrors. However, even this child would not be accepted from him (as a ransom). Mujahid and As-Suddi both said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİóÕöíáóÊöåö</div><br>  (and his Fasilah) "This means his tribe and his kin.'' `Ikrimah said, "This means the subdivision of his tribe that he is from.'' Ashhab reported from Malik that he said, "His Fasilah is his mother.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóåóÇ áóÙóì</div><br>  (Verily, it will be the fire of Hell,) Here He is describing the Hell- fire and the severity of its heat.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÒøóÇÚóÉğ áøöáÔøóæóì </div><br>  (Nazza`ah the Shawa!) Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid both said, "It is the skin of the head.''

Qatadah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÒøóÇÚóÉğ áøöáÔøóæóì </div><br>  (Nazza`ah the Shawa!) "This means removing his important organs, and the respectable parts of his face, his creation and his limbs.'' Ad-Dahhak said, "This means it will scrape the flesh and the skin off of the bone until it leaves nothing of it remaining.'' Ibn Zayd said, "The Shawa is the marrow of the bones.'' As for,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÒøóÇÚóÉğ</div><br>  (Nazza`ah) Ibn Zayd said, "It is cutting their bones and transformation of their skins and their form.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÏúÚõæÇú ãóäú ÃóÏúÈóÑó æóÊóæóáøóì - æóÌóãóÚó İóÃóæúÚóì </div><br>  (Calling (all) such as turn their backs and turn away their faces. And collect and hide it.) meaning, the Fire will call out to its children whom Allah created for it, determining that they will perform the deeds deserving of it in the worldly life. So it will call them on the Day of Judgement with an eloquent and articulate tongue. Then it will pick them out from the people of the gathering just as birds pick seeds. This is because they were, as Allah said, of those who turned their backs and turned away. This means they denied with their hearts and abandoned the performance of deeds with their limbs.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóãóÚó İóÃóæúÚóì </div><br>  (And collect and hide it.) meaning, he gathered wealth piling it up, and he concealed it, meaning he hid it and refused to give the obligatory right of Allah that was due on it of spending and paying the Zakah. It has been recorded in a Hadith that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊõæÚöí İóíõæÚöíó Çááåõ Úóáóíúß»</div><br>  (Do not hold back (your wealth) or else Allah will hold back from you.)  </div></body></html>
