Then do not set up rivals unto Allah while you know.) (2:21-22) And here Allah says, after mentioning the creation of all these things:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößõãõ Çááøóåõ ÑóÈøõßõÜãú İóÊóÜÈóÜÑóßó Çááøóåõ ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (That is Allah, your Lord, so Blessed be Allah, the Lord of all that exists.) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.

Imam Ahmad recorded that after ending every prayer, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr used to say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ æóÍúÏóåõ áóÇ ÔóÑöíßó áóåõ¡áóåõ Çáúãõáúßõ æóáóåõ ÇáúÍóãúÏõ¡ æóåõæó Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ¡ áóÇ Íóæúáó æóáóÇ ŞõæøóÉó ÅöáøóÇ ÈöÇááåö¡ áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ¡ æóáóÇ äóÚúÈõÏõ ÅöáøóÇ ÅöíøóÇåõ¡ áóåõ ÇáäøöÚúãóÉõ æóáóåõ ÇáúİóÖúáõ æóáóåõ ÇáËøóäóÇÁõ ÇáúÍóÓóäõ¡ áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ ãõÎúáöÕöíäó áóåõ ÇáÏøöíäó æóáóæú ßóÑöåó ÇáúßóÇİöÑõæä»</div><br>  (There is no (true) God except Allah Alone with no partner or associate, to Him belongs the dominion and praise, for He is able to do all things; there is no strength and no power except with Allah; there is no (true) God except Allah and we worship none but Him; to Him belong blessings and virtue and goodly praise; there is no (true) God except Allah, we worship Him in all sincerity even though the disbelievers may hate that.) He said, "The Messenger of Allah used to say the Tahlil in this fashion after every prayer.'' Similar was also recorded by Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i.  </div></body></html>
