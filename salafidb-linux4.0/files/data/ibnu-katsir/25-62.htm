This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÒóíøóäøóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÂÁó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÈöãóÕóÜÈöíÍó</div><br>  (And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps) (67:5). Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÈóÇÑóßó ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóáó İöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ÈõÑõæÌÇğ æóÌóÚóáó İöíåóÇ ÓöÑóÇÌÇğ</div><br>  (Blessed be He Who has placed in the heaven Al-Buruj, and has placed therein a great lamp,) which is the sun which shines like a lamp, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ÓöÑóÇÌÇğ æóåøóÇÌÇğ </div><br>  (And We have made (therein) a shining lamp) (78:13).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóãóÑÇğ ãøõäöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (and a moon giving light.) means, shining and illuminated by the light of something else, different from the light of the sun, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóáó ÇáÔøóãúÓó ÖöíóÂÁğ æóÇáúŞóãóÑó äõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light) (10:5). And Allah tells us that Nuh, peace be upon him, said to his people:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑóæúÇú ßóíúİó ÎóáóŞó Çááøóåõ ÓóÈúÚó ÓóãóÜæóÊò ØöÈóÇŞÇğ - æóÌóÚóáó ÇáúŞóãóÑó İöíåöäøó äõæÑÇğ æóÌóÚóáó ÇáÔøóãúÓó ÓöÑóÇÌÇğ </div><br>  (See you not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another And has made the moon a light therein, and made the sun a lamp) (71:15-16). Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóáó Çáøóíúáó æóÇáäøóåóÇÑó ÎöáúİóÉğ</div><br>  (And He it is Who has put the night and the day in succession (Khilfatan),) meaning, each one comes after the other, in a never-ending alternation. When one goes the other comes, and vice versa, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÎøóÑ áóßõãõ ÇáÔøóãúÓó æóÇáúŞóãóÑó ÏóÂÆöÈóíäó</div><br>  (And He has made the sun and the moon, both constantly pursuing their courses) (14:33).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÛúÔöì Çáøóíúáó ÇáäøóåóÇÑó íóØúáõÈõåõ ÍóËöíËğÇ</div><br>  (He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly) (7:54).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÇáÔøóãúÓõ íóäÈóÛöì áóåóÂ Ãóä ÊÏúÑößó ÇáŞóãóÑó</div><br>  (It is not for the sun to overtake the moon) (36:40).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöãóäú ÃóÑóÇÏó Ãóä íóĞøóßøóÑó Ãóæú ÃóÑóÇÏó ÔõßõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (for such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.) means, He has caused them both to follow one another to show the times when His servants should worship Him. So whoever misses an act of worship during the night can make it up during the day, and whoever misses an act of worship during the day can make it up during the night. It was recorded in a Sahih Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó íóÈúÓõØõ íóÏóåõ ÈöÇááøóíúáö áöíóÊõæÈó ãõÓöíÁõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑö¡ æóíóÈúÓõØõ íóÏóåõ ÈöÇáäøóåóÇÑö áöíóÊõæÈó ãõÓöíÁõ Çááøóíúá»</div><br>  (Allah spreads forth His Hand at night for the one who has done evil during the day to repent, and He spreads forth His Hand during the day for the one who has done evil during the night to repent.) Mujahid and Qatadah said: "Khilfatan means different, i.e., because one is dark and the other is light.''  </div></body></html>
