Then Allah sent down His Sakinah (calmness, tranquillity, peace) upon him, and strengthened him with forces (angels) which you saw not, and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowermost, while the Word of Allah that became the uppermost; and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah supports His Prophet</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÊóäÕõÑõæåõ</div><br>  (If you help him not), if you do not support His Prophet , then it does not matter, for Allah will help, support, suffice and protect him, just as He did,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ÃóÎúÑóÌóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ËóÇäöíó ÇËúäóíúäö</div><br>  (when the disbelievers drove him out, the second of the two;) During the year of the Hijrah, the idolators tried to kill, imprison or expel the Prophet , who escaped with his friend and Companion, Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah, to the cave of Thawr. They remained in the cave for three days so that the pagans who were sent in their pursuit, returned (to Makkah), and they proceed to Al-Madinah. While in the cave, Abu Bakr was afraid the pagans might discover them for fear that some harm might touch the Messenger .
