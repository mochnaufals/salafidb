This has been said by Ibn `Abbas. It has been called this because it will overcome every matter. It will be frightful and horrifying. As Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ÃóÏúåóì æóÃóãóÑøõ</div><br>  (And the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.) (54:46) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÊóĞóßøóÑõ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ ãóÇ ÓóÚóì </div><br>  (The Day when man shall remember what he strove for.) meaning, at that time the Son of Adam will reflect upon all of his deeds, both the good and the evil. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãóÆöĞò íóÊóĞóßøóÑõ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ æóÃóäøóì áóåõ ÇáĞøößúÑóì</div><br>  (On the Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance avail him) (89:23) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈõÑøöÒóÊö ÇáúÌóÍöíãõ áöãóä íóÑóì </div><br>  (And Hell shall be made apparent for whoever sees.) meaning, it will become apparent for the onlookers, so the people will see it with their own eyes.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóãøóÇ ãóä ØóÛóì </div><br>  (Then for him who transgressed) meaning, who rebels and behaves arrogantly.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁÇËóÑó ÇáúÍóíóæÉó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ </div><br>  (And preferred the life of this world,) meaning, he gives it precedence over the matters of his religion and his Hereafter.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøó ÇáúÌóÍöíãó åöìó ÇáúãóÃúæóì </div><br>  (Verily his abode will be the Hell;) meaning, his final destination will be Hell, his food will be from the tree of Zaqqum, and his drink will be from Hamim.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ãóäú ÎóÇİó ãóŞóÇãó ÑóÈøöåö æóäóåóì ÇáäøóİúÓó Úóäö Çáúåóæóì </div><br>  (But as for him who feared standing before his Lord and forbade himself from desire.) meaning, he fears the standing before Allah, he fears Allah's judgement of him, he prevents his soul from following its desires, and he compels it to obey its Master.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó åöìó ÇáúãóÃúæóì </div><br>  (Verily Paradise will be his abode.) meaning, his final abode, his destination, and his place of return will be the spacious Paradise. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÃóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÃóíøóÇäó ãõÑúÓóÜåóÇ - İöíãó ÃóäÊó ãöä ĞößúÑóÇåóÇ - Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó ãõäÊóåóÜåóÂ </div><br>  (They ask you about the Hour -- when will be its appointed time What do you have to mention of it. To your Lord it is limited.) meaning, its knowledge is not with you, nor with any creature. Rather the knowledge of it is with Allah. He is the One Who knows the exact time of its occurrence.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ËóŞõáóÊú İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö áÇó ÊóÃúÊöíßõãú ÅöáÇøó ÈóÛúÊóÉğ íóÓúÜóáõæäóßó ßóÃóäøóßó Íóİöìøñ ÚóäúåóÇ Şõáú ÅöäøóãóÇ ÚöáúãõåóÇ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden. They ask you as if you have a good knowledge of it. Say: "The knowledge thereof is with Allah.'') (7:187) Allah says here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó ãõäÊóåóÜåóÂ </div><br>  (To your Lord it is limited.) Thus, when Jibril asked the Messenger of Allah about the time of the last Hour he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÇáúãóÓúÄõæáõ ÚóäúåóÇ ÈöÃóÚúáóãó ãöäó ÇáÓøóÇÆöá»</div><br>  (The one questioned about it knows no more than the questioner.) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóäÊó ãõäĞöÑõ ãóä íóÎúÔóÜåóÇ </div><br>  (You are only a warner for those who fear it,) meaning, `I sent you to warn mankind and caution them to beware of the torment and punishment of Allah. So whoever fears Allah, fears standing before Him, and His threat, then he will follow you, and thus be successful and victorious. However, whoever denies you and opposes you, then he will only suffer loss and failure.' Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÃóäøóåõãú íóæúãó íóÑóæúäóåóÇ áóãú íóáúÈóËõæÇú ÅöáÇøó ÚóÔöíøóÉğ Ãóæú ÖõÍóÜåóÇ </div><br>  (The Day they see it (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an (`Ashiyyah) afternoon or its (Duha) morning.) meaning, when they stand up from their graves to go to the place of Gathering, they will feel that the period of the worldy life was short, it will seem to them that it was only the afternoon of one day. Juwaybir reported from Ad-Dahhak from Ibn `Abbas:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÃóäøóåõãú íóæúãó íóÑóæúäóåóÇ áóãú íóáúÈóËõæÇú ÅöáÇøó ÚóÔöíøóÉğ Ãóæú ÖõÍóÜåóÇ </div><br>  (The Day they see it (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an (`Ashiyyah) afternoon or its (Duha) morning.) "As for `Ashiyyah, it is the time between noon until the setting of the sun.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÖõÍóÜåóÇ</div><br>  (Or its (Duha) morning) what is between sunrise and midday (noon).'' Qatadah said, "This refers to the time period of the worldly life in the eyes of the people when they see the Hereafter.'' This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat An-Nazi`at. And to Allah belongs all praise and thanks.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
