Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ æóÅöäøó áöáØøóÜÛöíäó</div><br>  (This is so! And for the Taghin), which refers to those who disobey Allah, may He be glorified, and oppose the Messengers of Allah, peace be upon them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÔóÑøó ãóÜóÇÈò</div><br>  (will be an evil final return.) means, the worst final return. Then Allah explains it by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ìóåóäøóãõ íóÕúáóæúäóåóÇ</div><br>  (Hell! Where they will enter) means, they will enter it and it will overwhelm them on all sides.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ìóåóäøóãó íóÕúáóæúäóåóÇ İóÈöÆúÓó ÇáúãöåóÇÏõ - åóÜĞóÇ İóáúíóĞõæŞõæåõ Íóãöíãñ æóÛóÓøóÇŞñ </div><br>  (and worst (indeed) is that place to rest! This is so! Then let them taste it -- Hamim and Ghassaq.) Hamim is something that has been heated to the ultimate degree, and Ghassaq is the opposite, something that is so intensely cold that it is unbearable. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÎóÑõ ãöä Ôóßúáöåö ÃóÒúæóÌñ </div><br>  (And other of similar kind (oppasite pairs) -- all together!) means, and other things of this kind, a thing and its opposite, serving as punishments. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, concerning the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÎóÑõ ãöä Ôóßúáöåö ÃóÒúæóÌñ </div><br>  (And other of similar kind -- all together!) "Different kinds of punishments.'' Others said, such as intense cold and intense heat, and drinking Hamim and eating the bitter tree of Az-Zaqqum, and being lifted up and thrown down, and other kinds of paired opposites, all of which are means of punishment. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Disputes of the People of Hell</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ İóæúÌñ ãøõŞúÊóÍöãñ ãøóÚóßõãú áÇó ãóÑúÍóÈÇğ Èöåöãú Åöäøóåõãú ÕóÇáõæ ÇáäøóÇÑö </div><br>  (This is a troop entering with you (in Hell), no welcome for them!

They will say, `why do we not see them with us in the Fire' Mujahid said, "This is what Abu Jahl will say; he will say, `what is the matter with me that I do not see Bilal and `Ammar and Suhayb and so-and-so...' This is an example; all the disbelievers are like this, they think that the believers will go to Hell, so when the disbelievers enter Hell, they will wonder why they do not see them there, and they will say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ áóäóÇ áÇó äóÑóì ÑöÌóÇáÇğ ßõäøóÇ äóÚõÏøõåõãú ãøöäó ÇáÇøñÔúÑóÇÑöÃóÊøóÎóĞúäóÜåõãú ÓöÎúÑöíøÇğ</div><br>  (What is the matter with us that we see not men whom we used to count among the bad ones Did we take them as an object of mockery,) means, in this world,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÒóÇÛóÊú Úóäúåõãõ ÇáÃóÈúÕóÜÑõ</div><br>  (or have (our) eyes failed to perceive them) means, they will try to console themselves with this wishful thinking, so they will say, perhaps they are here in Hell with us, but we have not laid eyes on them. Then they will find out that they (the believers) are in the lofty levels of Paradise, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÇÏóì ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÃóÕúÍóÜÈó ÇáäøóÇÑö Ãóä ŞóÏú æóÌóÏúäóÇ ãóÇ æóÚóÏóäóÇ ÑóÈøõäóÇ ÍóŞøğÇ İóåóáú æóÌóÏÊøõã ãøóÇ æóÚóÏó ÑóÈøõßõãú ÍóŞøğÇ ŞóÇáõæÇú äóÚóãú İóÃóĞøóäó ãõÄóĞøöäñ Èóíúäóåõãú Ãóä áøóÚúäóÉõ Çááøóåö Úóáóì ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó </div><br>  (And the dwellers of Paradise will call out to the dwellers of the Fire (saying): "We have indeed found true what our Lord had promised us; have you also found true what your Lord promised (warned)'' They shall say: "Yes.''
