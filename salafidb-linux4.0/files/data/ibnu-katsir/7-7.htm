Both of these times are periods of rest and leisure or heedlessness and amusement. Allah also said   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÃóãöäó Ãóåúáõ ÇáúŞõÑóì Ãóä íóÃúÊöíóåõã ÈóÃúÓõäóÇ ÈóíóÜÊÇğ æóåõãú äóÂÆöãõæäó - Ãóæó Ãóãöäó Ãóåúáõ ÇáúŞõÑóì Ãóä íóÃúÊöíóåõãú ÈóÃúÓõäóÇ ÖõÍğì æóåõãú íóáúÚóÈõæäó </div><br>  (Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing)7:97-98 and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÃóãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ãóßóÑõæÇú ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÇÊö Ãóä íóÎúÓöİó Çááøóåõ Èöåöãõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖó Ãóæú íóÃúÊöíóåõãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ ãöäú ÍóíúËõ áÇó íóÔúÚõÑõæäó - Ãóæú íóÃúÎõĞóåõãú İöì ÊóŞóáøõÈöåöãú İóãóÇ åõã ÈöãõÚúÌöÒöíäó - Ãóæú íóÃúÎõĞóåõãú Úóáóì ÊóÎóæøõİò İóÅöäøó ÑóÈøóßõãú áóÑóÄõæİñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (Do then those who devise evil plots feel secure that Allah will not sink them into the earth, or that the torment will not seize them from directions they perceive not Or that He may catch them in the midst of their going to and from, so that there be no escape for them Or that He may catch them with gradual wastage.

Allah's saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÏóÚúæóÇåõãú ÅöĞú ÌóÂÁóåõã ÈóÃúÓõäóÂ ÅöáÇó Ãóä ŞóÇáõæÇú ÅöäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ ÙóÜáöãöíäó </div><br>  (No cry did they utter when Our torment came upon them but this: "Verily, we were wrongdoers.'') This means, when the torment came to them, their cry was that they admitted their sins and that they deserved to be punished. Allah said in a similar Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóãú ŞóÕóãúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÑúíóÉò ßóÇäóÊú ÙóÜáöãóÉğ</div><br>  (How many a town given to wrongdoing, have We destroyed)21:11, until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÜãöÏöíäó</div><br>  (Extinct)21:15.

Allah will question the nations, on the Day of Resurrection, how they responded to His Messengers and the Messages He sent them with. He will also question the Messengers if they conveyed His Messages. So, `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, who said commenting on the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóäóÓúÜóáóäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõÑúÓöáó Åöáóíúåöãú æóáóäóÓúÜóáóäøó ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíäó </div><br>  (Then surely, We shall question those (people) to whom it (the Book) was sent and verily, We shall question the Messengers.) He said; "About what they conveyed.''  Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóäóŞõÕøóäøó Úóáóíúåöã ÈöÚöáúãò æóãóÇ ßõäøóÇ ÛóÂÆöÈöíäó </div><br>  (Then surely, We shall narrate unto them (their whole story) with knowledge, and indeed We have not been absent.) "The Book will be brought forth on the Day of Resurrection and it will speak, disclosing what they used to do.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßõäøóÇ ÛóÂÆöÈöíäó</div><br>  (and indeed We have not been absent) meaning, On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will inform His servants about what they said and did, whether substantial or minor. Certainly, He witnesses to everything, nothing escapes His observation, and He is never unaware of anything. Rather, He has perfect knowledge of what the eyes are deluded by and what the hearts conceal,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊóÓúŞõØõ ãöä æóÑóŞóÉò ÅöáÇøó íóÚúáóãõåóÇ æóáÇó ÍóÈøóÉò İöì ÙõáõãóÜÊö ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóáÇó ÑóØúÈò æóáÇó íóÇÈöÓò ÅöáÇøó İöì ßöÊóÜÈò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (Not a leaf falls, but He knows it.
