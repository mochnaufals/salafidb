It was reported that the reason behind revealing this Ayah was that a man from the Ansar and a Jew had a dispute, and the Jew said, "Let us refer to Muhammad to judge between us.'' However, the Muslim man said, "Let us refer to Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf (a Jew) to judge between us.'' It was also reported that the Ayah was revealed about some hypocrites who pretended to be Muslims, yet they sought to refer to the judgment of Jahiliyyah. Other reasons were also reported behind the revelation of the Ayah. However, the Ayah has a general meaning, as it chastises all those who refrain from referring to the Qur'an and Sunnah for judgment and prefer the judgment of whatever they chose of falsehood, which befits the description of Taghut here. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÑöíÏõæäó Ãóä íóÊóÍóÇßóãõæÇú Åöáóì ÇáØøóÜÛõæÊö</div><br>  (and they wish to go for judgment to the Taghut) until the end of the Ayah. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÕõÏøõæäó Úóäßó ÕõÏõæÏÇğ</div><br>  (turn away from you with aversion) means, they turn away from you in arrogance, just as Allah described the polytheists,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ Şöíáó áóåõãõ ÇÊøóÈöÚõæÇú ãóÂ ÃóäÒóáó Çááøóåõ ŞóÇáõæÇú Èóáú äóÊøóÈöÚõ ãóÇ æóÌóÏúäóÇ Úóáóíúåö ÁóÇÈóÂÁóäóÇ</div><br>  (When it is said to them: "Follow what Allah has sent down.''

Allah describes these people to us further in His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóÑóì ÇáøóĞöíäó İöì ŞõáõæÈöåöã ãøóÑóÖñ íõÓóÜÑöÚõæäó İöíåöãú íóŞõæáõæäó äóÎúÔóì</div><br>  (And you see those in whose hearts there is a disease (of hypocrisy), they hurry to their friendship, saying: "We fear''), until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíõÕúÈöÍõæÇú Úóáóì ãóÂ ÃóÓóÑøõæÇú İöì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú äóÜÏöãöíäó</div><br>  (Then they will become regretful for what they have been keeping as a secret in themselves). At-Tabarani recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "Abu Barzah Al-Aslami used to be a soothsayer who judged between the Jews in their disputes.

Consequently, O Muhammad! Let Allah be sufficient for you in this regard, because He has perfect knowledge of their apparent and hidden affairs. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÚúÑöÖú Úóäúåõãú</div><br>  (so turn aside from them (do not punish them)) meaning, do not punish them because of what is in their hearts.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚöÙúåõãú</div><br>  (but admonish them) means, advise them against the hypocrisy and evil that reside in their hearts,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõá áøóåõãú İöì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú ŞóæúáÇğ ÈóáöíÛÇğ</div><br>  (and speak to them an effective word to reach their inner selves) advise them, between you and them, using effective words that might benefit them.  </div></body></html>
