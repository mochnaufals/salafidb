Then Allah tells us of His mighty power, by which the heavens and the earth stand by His command, and the forces that He has placed between them to hold them. He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íõãúÓößõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó Ãóä ÊóÒõæáÇó</div><br>  (Verily, Allah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they should move away from their places,) means, lest they should shift from where they are.

He is Ever Most Forbearing and Oft-Forgiving because He sees His servants disbelieving in Him and disobeying Him, yet He is patient and gives them time, He waits and does not hasten the punishment, and He conceals the faults of others and forgives them. He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÍóáöíãğÇ ÛóİõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (Truly, He is Ever Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.)  </div></body></html>
