No apparent matter or secret that the heart conceals is ever a secret to Him, however minor it is. Allah also states that He will hold His servants accountable for what they do and what they conceal in their hearts. In similar statements, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Åöä ÊõÎúİõæÇú ãóÇ İöì ÕõÏõæÑößõãú Ãóæú ÊõÈúÏõæåõ íóÚúáóãúåõ Çááøóåõ æóíóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÇááøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ </div><br>  (Say (O Muhammad ): "Whether you hide what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allah knows it, and He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth.

There are many other Ayat on this subject. In this Ayah 2:284, Allah states that He has knowledge of what the hearts conceal, and consequently, He will hold the creation accountable for whatever is in their hearts. This is why when this Ayah was revealed, it was hard on the Companions, since out of their strong faith and conviction, they were afraid that such reckoning would diminish their good deeds.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, "When   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöáøóåö ãóÇ İöí ÇáÓøóãóÜæÊö æóãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÅöä ÊõÈúÏõæÇú ãóÇ İöí ÃóäİõÓößõãú Ãóæú ÊõÎúİõæåõ íõÍóÇÓöÈúßõã Èöåö Çááøóåõ İóíóÛúİöÑõ áöãóä íóÔóÂÁõ æóíõÚóĞøöÈõ ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ æóÇááøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ </div><br>  (To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is able to do all things)  was revealed to the Messenger of Allah , it was very hard for the Companions of the Messenger . The Companions came to the Messenger and fell to their knees saying, `O Messenger of Allah! We were asked to perform what we can bear of deeds: the prayer, the fast, Jihad and charity. However, this Ayah was revealed to you, and we cannot bear it.' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊõÑöíÏõæäó Ãóäú ÊóŞõæáõæÇ ßóãÇ ŞóÇáó Ãóåúáõ ÇáúßöÊóÇÈóíúäö ãöäú ŞóÈúáößõãú: ÓóãöÚúäóÇ æóÚóÕóíúäóÇ¿ Èóáú ŞõæáõæÇ: ÓóãöÚúäóÇ æóÃóØóÚúäóÇ ÛõİúÑóÇäóßó ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÅöáóíúßó ÇáúãóÕöíÑ»</div><br>  (Do you want to repeat what the People of the Two Scriptures before you said, that is, `We hear and we disobey' Rather, say, `We hear and we obey, and we seek Your forgiveness, O our Lord, and the Return is to You.)

When they did that, Allah abrogated the Ayah 2:284 and sent down the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íõßóáøöİõ Çááøóåõ äóİúÓğÇ ÅöáÇøó æõÓúÚóåóÇ áóåóÇ ãóÇ ßóÓóÈóÊú æóÚóáóíúåóÇ ãóÇ ÇßúÊóÓóÈóÊú ÑóÈøóäóÇ áÇó ÊõÄóÇÎöĞúäóÂ Åöä äøóÓöíäóÂ Ãóæú ÃóÎúØóÃúäóÇ</div><br>  (Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.
