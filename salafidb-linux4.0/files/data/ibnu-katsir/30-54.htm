In this world they worship idols, and in the Hereafter they will also display great ignorance. They will swear by Allah that they did not even stay for one hour in this world. They will mean that there was not enough time given to establish proof against them which would leave them with no excuse. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó ßóÇäõæÇú íõÄúİóßõæäóæóŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúÚöáúãó æóÇáÅöíãóÜäó áóŞóÏú áóÈöËúÊõãú İöì ßöÊóÜÈö Çááøóåö Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúÈóÚúËö</div><br>  (thus were they ever deluded. And those who have been bestowed with knowledge and Faith will say: "Indeed you have stayed according to the decree of Allah, until the Day of Resurrection...'') The believers who have knowledge of the Hereafter will respond to them, just as they established the proof of Allah against them in this world. When they swear that they did not stay even one hour in this world, they will say to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú áóÈöËúÊõãú İöì ßöÊóÜÈö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Indeed you have stayed according to the decree of Allah,) meaning, the Book of deeds,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúÈóÚúËö</div><br>  (until the Day of Resurrection;) means, `from the day when you were created until the day you were resurrected.
