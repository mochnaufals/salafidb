If they were to see any kind of sign, whether it was at their own direction or otherwise, they would not believe in it and they would think that it was magic and falsehood, as they said when the moon was cleft asunder, etc., as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÍóŞøóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó - æóáóæú ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ßõáøõ ÁÇíóÉò ÍóÊøóì íóÑóæõÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáÇøñáöíãó </div><br>  (Truly, those, against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe.

He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóåõ íóáúÈöÓõ ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÂäó¡ İóÅöäøó ÃóŞúæóÇãğÇ ãöäúßõãú íõÕóáøõæäó ãóÚóäóÇ áóÇ íõÍúÓöäõæäó ÇáúæõÖõæÁó¡ İóãóäú ÔóåöÏó ãöäúßõãõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó ãóÚóäóÇ İóáúíõÍúÓöäö ÇáúæõÖõæÁ»</div><br>  (We have become confused in our recitation of Qur'an, because some people among you are praying with us but they have not performed Wudu' properly. Whoever attends the prayer with us, let him perform Wudu' properly.) This has a Hasan chain of narration, the text itself is Hasan. It contains amazing information, that the Prophet was affected by the faulty Wudu' of some of those whom he was leading in prayer. This indicates that the prayer of the person who is praying in the congregation is connected to the prayer of the Imam. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ar-Rum. Allah's is the praise and thanks.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
