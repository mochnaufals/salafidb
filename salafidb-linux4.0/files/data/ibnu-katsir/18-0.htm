He looked, and saw a fog or cloud overhead. He mentioned this to the Prophet , who said:   <br><div id="arabic" dir=rtl>«ÇŞúÑóÃú İõáóÇäõ¡ İóÅöäøóåóÇ ÇáÓøóßöíäóÉõ ÊóäúÒöáõ ÚöäúÏó ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö Ãóæú ÊóäóÒøóáóÊú áöáúŞõÑúÂä»</div><br>  (Keep on reciting so and so, for this is the tranquillity which descends when one reads Qur'an or because of reading Qur'an;) This was also recorded in the Two Sahihs. This man who recited it was Usayd bin Al-Hudayr, as we have previously mentioned in our Tafsir of Surat Al-Baqarah. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Ad-Darda' that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÍóİöÙó ÚóÔúÑó ÂíóÇÊò ãöäú Ãóæøóáö ÓõæÑóÉö Çáúßóåúİö ÚõÕöãó ãöäó ÇáÏøóÌøóÇá»</div><br>  (Whoever memorizes ten Ayat from the beginning of Surat Al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjal.) This was also recorded by Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and At-Tirmidhi.

He said, it is "Hasan Sahih. '' In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim recorded from Abu Sa`id that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ŞóÑóÃó ÓõæÑóÉó Çáúßóåúİö İöí íóæúãö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö ÃóÖóÇÁó áóåõ ãöäó ÇáäøõæÑö ãóÇ Èóíúäóåõ æóÈóíúäó ÇáúÌõãõÚóÊóíúä»</div><br>  (Whoever recites Surat Al-Kahf on Friday, it will illuminate him with light from one Friday to the next.) Then he said: "This Hadith has a Sahih chain, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.'' Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi also recorded it in his Sunan from Al-Hakim, then he narrated with his own chain that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ŞóÑóÃó ÓõæÑóÉó Çáúßóåúİö ßóãóÇ äóÒóáóÊú¡ ßóÇäóÊú áóåõ äõæÑğÇ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (Whoever recites Surat Al-Kahf as it was revealed, it will be a light for him on the Day of Resurrection.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÓúãö Çááøóåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö </div><br>  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  </div></body></html>
