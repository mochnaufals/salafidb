This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÊóÈó Çááøóåõ áÇøÛúáöÈóäøó ÃóäóÇú æóÑõÓõáöì Åöäøó Çááøóåó Şóæöìøñ ÚóÒöíÒñ </div><br>  (Allah has decreed: "Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious.'' Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty.) (58:21), and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ áóäóäÕõÑõ ÑõÓõáóäóÇ æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóíóæúãó íóŞõæãõ ÇáÇøñÔúåóÜÏõ </div><br>  (Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in this world's life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth.) (40:51).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÓóÈóŞóÊú ßóáöãóÊõäóÇ áöÚöÈóÇÏöäóÇ ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíäó - Åöäøóåõãú áóåõãõ ÇáúãóäÕõæÑõæäó </div><br>  (And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our servants, the Messengers, that they verily would be made triumphant,) meaning, `in this world and in the Hereafter, as We have already stated that they would prevail over their people who disbelieved in them and went against them, and how Allah destroyed the disbelievers and saved His believing servants. '   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ÌõäÏóäóÇ áóåõãõ ÇáúÛóÜáöÈõæäó </div><br>  (And that Our hosts they verily would be the victors.) means, that they would ultimately prevail.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóæóáøó Úóäúåõãú ÍóÊøóì Íöíäò </div><br>  (So turn away from them for a while,) means, `bear their annoyance with patience and wait until an appointed time, when We shall cause you to prevail and will grant you victory.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÈúÕöÑúåõãú İóÓóæúİó íõÈúÕöÑõæäó </div><br>  (And watch them and they shall see!) means, `watch them and see what will happen to them by way of punishment for their opposition towards you and their disbelief in you.' Allah said, as a threat and a warning,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó íõÈúÕöÑõæäó</div><br>  (and they shall see!). Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÈöÚóĞóÇÈöäóÇ íóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõæäó </div><br>  (Do they seek to hasten on Our torment) meaning, `they seek to hasten on the punishment because they disbelieve in you, and Allah is angry with them because of that and will make them suffer the consequences, and because of their disbelief and stubbornness, He will hasten on the punishment.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ äóÒóáó ÈöÓóÇÍóÊöåöãú İóÓóÂÁó ÕóÈóÇÍõ ÇáúãõäúĞóÑöíäó </div><br>  (Then, when it descends in their courtyard, evil will be the morning for those who had been warned!) means, when the punishment comes down to the place where they are, terrible will be the day of their punishment and destruction. As-Suddi said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ äóÒóáó ÈöÓóÇÍóÊöåöãú</div><br>  (Then, when it descends in their courtyard,) means, in their homes;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóÂÁó ÕóÈóÇÍõ ÇáúãõäúĞóÑöíäó</div><br>  (evil will be the morning for those who had been warned!) means, how terrible that morning will be for them. It was reported in the Two Sahihs that Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "On the morning of Khaybar, when the people came out with their tools (to go about their daily work) and saw the (Muslim) army, they went back and said, `Muhammad by Allah! Muhammad and the army!' The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááåõ ÃóßúÈóÑõ¡ ÎóÑöÈóÊú ÎóíúÈóÑõ¡ ÅöäøóÇ ÅöĞóÇ äóÒóáúäóÇ ÈöÓóÇÍóÉö Şóæúãò İóÓóÇÁó ÕóÈóÇÍõ ÇáúãõäúĞóÑöíä»</div><br>  (Allahu Akbar! Khaybar has been destroyed. Then, when it descends in the courtyard of any people, evil will be the morning for those who had been warned!)''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóæóáøó Úóäúåõãú ÍóÊøóì Íöíäò æóÃóÈúÕöÑú İóÓóæúİó íõÈúÕöÑõæäó-</div><br>  (So turn away from them for a while, and watch and they shall see!) This is a reiteration of the command stated above. And Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
