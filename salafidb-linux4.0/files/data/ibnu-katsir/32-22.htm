This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÍóÓöÈó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÌúÊóÑóÍõæÇú ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÜÊö Ãóä äøóÌúÚóáóåõãú ßóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö ÓóæóÂÁğ ãøóÍúíóÜåõãú æóãóãóÜÊõåõãú ÓóÂÁó ãóÇ íóÍúßõãõæäó </div><br>  (Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds, in their present life and after their death Worst is the judgement that they make.)

Something similar was also narrated from Ubayy bin Ka`b, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Al-Hasan, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak, `Alqamah, `Atiyah, Mujahid, Qatadah, `Abd Al-Karim Al-Jazari and Khusayf.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäú ÃóÙúáóãõ ãöãøóä ĞõßøöÑó ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊö ÑóÈøöåö Ëõãøó ÃóÚúÑóÖó ÚóäúåóÂ</div><br>  (And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayat of his Lord, then turns aside therefrom) means, there is no one who does more wrong than the one whom Allah reminds of His signs and explains them to him clearly, then after that he neglects and ignores them, and turns away from them, forgetting them as if he does not know them. Qatadah said: "Beware of turning away from the remembrance of Allah, for whoever turns away from remembering Him will be the most misguided and the most in need, and the most guilty of sin.'' Allah says, warning the one who does that:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ãöäó ÇáúãõÌúÑöãöíäó ãõäÊóŞöãõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, We shall exact retribution from the criminals.) meaning, `We shall avenge Ourselves on those who do that in the strongest possible terms.'  </div></body></html>
