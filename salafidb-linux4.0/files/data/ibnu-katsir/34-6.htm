One of these Ayat is in Surah Yunus, where Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÊóäúÈöÆõæäóßó ÃóÍóŞøñ åõæó Şõáú Åöì æóÑóÈøöì Åöäøóåõ áóÍóŞøñ æóãóÂ ÃóäÊõãú ÈöãõÚúÌöÒöíäó </div><br>  (And they ask you to inform them (saying): "Is it true'' Say: "Yes! By my Lord! It is the very truth! and you cannot escape it!'') (10:53). The second of these Ayat is this one:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú áÇó ÊóÃúÊöíäóÇ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ Şõáú Èóáóì æóÑóÈøöì áóÊóÃúÊöíóäøóßõãú</div><br>  (Those who disbelieve say: "The Hour will not come to us.'' Say: "Yes, by my Lord, it will come to you...''). And the third of them appears in Surat At-Taghabun, where Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÒóÚóãó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú Ãóä áøóä íõÈúÚóËõæÇú Şõáú Èóáóì æóÑóÈøöì áóÊõÈúÚóËõäøó Ëõãøó áóÊõäóÈøóÄõäøó ÈöãóÇ ÚóãöáúÊõãú æóĞóáößó Úóáóì Çááøóåö íóÓöíÑñ </div><br>  (The disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected (for reckoning). Say: "Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed of what you did; and that is easy for Allah'') (64:7). And Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Èóáóì æóÑóÈøöì áóÊóÃúÊöíóäøóßõãú</div><br>  (Say: "Yes, by my Lord, it will come to you...'') Then Allah is described in a manner that affirms that:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÜáöãö ÇáúÛóíúÈö áÇó íóÚúÒõÈõ Úóäúåõ ãöËúŞóÇáõ ĞóÑøóÉò İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóáÇó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóáÇó ÃóÕúÛóÑõ ãöä Ğóáößó æóáÇó ÃóßúÈóÑõ ÅöáÇøó İöì ßöÊóÜÈò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (the All-Knower of the Unseen, not even the weight of a speck of dust or less than that or greater escapes His knowledge in the heavens or in the earth but it is in a Clear Book.) Mujahid and Qatadah said, "Nothing is hidden or concealed from Him.'' In other words, everything is encompassed by His knowledge, and nothing is hidden from Him. Even though bones may be scattered and disintegrate, He knows where they have gone and where they have dispersed, then He will bring them back just as He created them in the first place, because He has knowledge of all things. Then Allah tells us of His wisdom in re-creating bodies and bringing about the Hour, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíóÌúÒöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö ÃõæúáóÜÆößó áóåõãú ãøóÛúİöÑóÉñ æóÑöÒúŞñ ßóÑöíãñ æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÓóÚóæúÇ İöì ÁóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ ãõÚóÇÌöÒöíäó</div><br>  (That He may recompense those who believe and do righteous good deeds. Those, theirs is forgiveness and generous provision. But those who strive against Our Ayat to frustrate them) meaning, those who try to turn others away from the path of Allah and who disbelieve His Messengers,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó áóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ ãøöä ÑøöÌúÒò Ãóáöíãñ</div><br>  (those, for them will be a severe painful torment.) This means, He will bestow His favor upon the blessed, who are the believers, and will punish the doomed, who are the disbelievers. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÓúÊóæöì ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáäøóÇÑö æóÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö åõãõ ÇáúİóÂÆöÒõæäó </div><br>  (Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise.

The Exalted in might is the One Who is All-Powerful, Whom none can overwhelm or resist, but He subjugates and controls all things. The Owner of All praise is the One Who, in all His words, deeds, laws and decrees, is deserving of praise, may He be glorified and exalted.  </div></body></html>
