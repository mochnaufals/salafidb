They appointed equals and rivals with Allah, worshipping them along with Allah and loving them, just as they love Allah. However, Allah is the only deity worthy of worship, Who has neither rival nor opponent nor partner. It is reported in the Sahihayn that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said: I said, "O Messenger of Allah! What is the greatest sin'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóäú ÊóÌúÚóáó ááåö äöÏøğÇ æóåõæó ÎóáóŞóß»</div><br>  (To appoint a rival to Allah while He Alone has created you.)

Then, Allah warns those who commit Shirk,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú íóÑóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú ÅöĞú íóÑóæúäó ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó Ãóäøó ÇáúŞõæøóÉó áöáøóåö ÌóãöíÚğÇ</div><br>  (If only, those who do wrong could see, when they will see the torment, that all power belongs to Allah.) if these people knew what they will face and the terrible punishment they are to suffer because of their disbelief and Shirk (polytheism), then they would shun the deviation that they live by.  Allah mentions their false beliefs in their idols, and that those they followed will declare their innocence of them.
