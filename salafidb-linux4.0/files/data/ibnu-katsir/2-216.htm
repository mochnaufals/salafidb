Fighting is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Jihad is made Obligatory</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  In this Ayah, Allah made it obligatory for the Muslims to fight in Jihad against the evil of the enemy who transgress against Islam. Az-Zuhri said, "Jihad is required from every person, whether he actually joins the fighting or remains behind. Whoever remains behind is required to give support, if support is warranted; to provide aid, if aid is needed; and to march forth, if he is commanded to do so. If he is not needed, then he remains behind.'' It is reported in the Sahih:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ãóÇÊó æóáóãú íóÛúÒõ æóáóãú íõÍóÏøöËú äóİúÓóåõ ÈöÇáúÛóÒúæö¡ ãóÇÊó ãöíÊóÉğ ÌóÇåöáöíøóÜÜÉ»</div><br>  (Whoever dies but neither fought (i.e., in Allah's cause), nor sincerely considered fighting, will die a death of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic era of ignorance).)  On the day of Al-Fath (when he conquered Makkah), the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ åöÌúÑóÉó ÈóÚúÏó ÇáúİóÊúÍö æóáßöäú ÌöåóÇÏñ æóäöíøóÉñ¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÇÓúÊõäúİöÑúÊõãú İóÇäúİöÑõæÇ»</div><br>  (There is no Hijrah (migration from Makkah to Al-Madinah) after the victory, but only Jihad and good intention. If you were required to march forth, then march forth.)  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ßõÑúåñ áøóßõãú</div><br>  (...though you dislike it) means, `Fighting is difficult and heavy on your hearts.' Indeed, fighting is as the Ayah describes it, as it includes being killed, wounded, striving against the enemies and enduring the hardship of travel. Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóÓóì Ãóä ÊóßúÑóåõæÇú ÔóíúÆğÇ æóåõæó ÎóíúÑñ áøóßõãú</div><br>  (. ..and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you) meaning, fighting is followed by victory, dominance over the enemy, taking over their lands, money and offspring. Allah continues:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóÓóì Ãóä ÊõÍöÈøõæÇú ÔóíúÆğÇ æóåõæó ÔóÑøñ áøóßõãú</div><br>  (...and that you like a thing which is bad for you.)  This Ayah is general in meaning. Hence, one might covet something, yet in reality it is not good or beneficial for him, such as refraining from joining the Jihad, for it might lead to the enemy taking over the land and the government. Then, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóÚúáóãõ æóÃóäÊõãú áÇó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (Allah knows, but you do not know.) meaning, He has better knowledge than you of how things will turn out to be in the end, and of what benefits you in this earthly life and the Hereafter. Hence, obey Him and adhere to His commands, so that you may acquire the true guidance.  </div></body></html>
