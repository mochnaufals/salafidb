And it orders him to be patient. This is why he once said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑóÍúãóÉõ Çááåö Úóáóì ãõæÓóì áóŞóÏú ÃõæĞöíó ÈöÃóßúËóÑó ãöäú åóĞóÇ İóÕóÈóÑ»</div><br>  (May Allah have mercy with Musa: he was annoyed more than this, yet he was patient.)

I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawrah before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.'') `Isa said, "The Tawrah conveyed the glad tidings of my coming, and my coming confirms the truth of the Tawrah. I convey the glad tidings of the Prophet who will come after me. He is the unlettered, Makkan, Arab Prophet and Messenger, Ahmad.'' `Isa, peace be upon him, is the last and final Messenger from among the Children of Israel. He remained among the Children of Israel for a while, conveying the good news of the coming of Muhammad, whose name is also Ahmad, the Last and Final Prophet and Messenger. After Muhammad, there will be no prophethood or Messengers. How admirable the Hadith is that Al-Bukhari collected in his Sahih from Jubayr bin Mut`im, who said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó áöí ÃóÓúãóÇÁğ: ÃóäóÇ ãõÍóãøóÏñ¡ æóÃóäóÇ ÃóÍúãóÏõ¡ æóÃóäóÇ ÇáúãóÇÍöí ÇáøóĞöí íóãúÍõæ Çááåõ Èöåö ÇáúßõİúÑó¡æóÃóäóÇ ÇáúÍóÇÔöÑõ ÇáøóĞöí íõÍúÔóÑõ ÇáäøóÇÓõ Úóáóì ŞóÏóãóíøó¡ æóÃóäóÇ ÇáúÚóÇŞöÈ»</div><br>  (I have names. I am Muhammad and Ahmad. I am Al-Mahi through whom Allah will eliminate disbelief. I am Al-Hashir who will be the first to be resurrected, with the people being resurrected Hereafter. I am also Al-`Aqib (i.e., there will be no Prophet after me).'') Also Muslim collected this Hadith from Az-Zuhri from Jubayr. Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded that Khalid bin Ma`dan said that some Companions of Allah's Messenger said, "O Allah's Messenger! Tell us about yourself.'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÏóÚúæóÉõ ÃóÈöí ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãó¡ æóÈõÔúÑóì ÚöíÓóì¡ æóÑóÃóÊú Ãõãøöí Íöíäó ÍóãóáóÊú Èöí ßóÃóäøóåõ ÎóÑóÌó ãöäúåÇ äõæÑñ ÃóÖóÇÁóÊú áóåõ ŞõÕõæÑõ ÈõÕúÑóì ãöäú ÃóÑúÖö ÇáÔøóÇã»</div><br>  (I am the (result of the) invocation made to Allah from my father Ibrahim and the good news `Isa delivered. When my mother was pregnant with me, she had a dream in which she saw a light emanating from her that radiated the palaces of Busra in Ash-Sham.'' This Hadith has a good chain of narration that is supported by other similar narrations. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-`Irbad bin Sariyah said, "The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí ÚöäúÏó Çááåö áóÎóÇÊóãõ ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó¡ æóÅöäøó ÂÏóãó áóãõäúÌóÏöáñ İöí ØöíäóÊöåö¡ æóÓóÃõäóÈøöÆõßõãú ÈöÃóæøóáö Ğóáößó: ÏóÚúæóÉõ ÃóÈöí ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãó¡ æóÈöÔóÇÑóÉõ ÚöíÓóì Èöí¡ æóÑõÄúíóÇ Ãõãøöí ÇáøóÊöí ÑóÃóÊú¡ æóßóĞóáößó ÃõãøóåóÇÊõ ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó íóÑóíúä»</div><br>  (I was written with Allah as the Last and Final of the Prophet, even when Adam was still clay. I will tell of the first good news announcing my advent, the (result of the) invocation to Allah made from my father Ibrahim, the good news `Isa conveyed, and the dream that my mother saw. The mothers of all Prophets see similar dreams.'') Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Umamah said, "I said, `O Allah's Messenger! What was the first good news of your coming' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÏóÚúæóÉõ ÃóÈöí ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãó¡ æóÈõÔúÑóì ÚöíÓóì¡ æóÑóÃóÊú Ãõãøöí Ãóäøóåõ íóÎúÑõÌõ ãöäúåóÇ äõæÑñ ÃóÖóÇÁóÊú áóåõ ŞõÕõæÑõ ÇáÔøóÇã»</div><br>  (The (result of the) invocation to Allah made from my father Ibrahim and the good news `Isa conveyed. My mother saw a light emanating from her that filled the palaces of Ash- Sham in a dream.)'' Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah sent eighty men, including `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Ja`far bin Abi Talib, `Abdullah bin `Urfutah, `Uthman bin Maz`un, Abu Musa, and others, to An-Najashi. The Quraysh sent `Amr bin Al-`As and `Umarah bin Al-Walid with a gift for An-Najashi. When they, `Amr and `Umarah, came to An-Najashi, they prostrated before him and stood to his right and left. `Amr and `Umarah said, "Some of our cousins migrated to your land; they have abandoned us and our religion.'' An-Najashi said, "Where are they'' They said, "They are in your land, so send for them,'' so An-Najashi summoned the Muslims. Ja`far said to the Muslims, "I will be your speaker today.'' So, the Muslims followed Ja`far and when he entered on the king he did not prostrate after greeting him. They said to Ja`far, "Why do you not prostrate before the king'' Ja`far said, "We only prostrate for Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.'' They said, "Why'' He said, "Allah has sent a Messenger to us from Him, who ordered us not to prostrate to anyone except Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. He also ordered to perform prayer and give charity.'' `Amr bin Al-`As said, "They contradict your creed about `Isa, son of Maryam.'' The king asked, "What do you say about `Isa and his mother Maryam'' Ja`far said, "We only say what Allah said about him, that he is Allah's Word, a soul created by Allah and sent down to the honorable virgin who was not touched by a man nor bearing children before.'' An-Najashi lifted a straw of wood and said, "O Ethiopians, monks and priests! By Allah, what they say about `Isa is no more than what we say about him, not even a difference that equals this straw. You are welcomed among us, and greetings to him who sent you. I bear witness that he is Allah's Messenger whom we read about in the Injil. He is the Prophet who `Isa, son of Maryam, foretold the good news about his advent. Live wherever you wish. By Allah, had I not been entrusted with the responsibilities of kingship, I would have gone to him, so that I could be honored by carrying his slippers and his water for ablution.'' The king ordered that the gifts of the idolators be returned to them. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud soon returned and later on participated in the battle of Badr. He said that when the Prophet received the news that An-Najashi died, he invoked Allah to forgive him. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÌóÇÁóåõã ÈöÇáúÈóíøöäóÜÊö ŞóÇáõæÇú åóÜĞóÇ ÓöÍúÑñ ãøõÈöíäñ</div><br>  (But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said: "This is plain magic.'') this refers to Ahmad, who was anticipated, in accordance with the early Scriptures and early generations, according to Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Jarir. When the Prophet appeared bringing clear signs, the disbelievers and rejecters said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ ÓöÍúÑñ ãøõÈöíäñ</div><br>  (This is plain magic)  </div></body></html>
