Therefore, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ßóÇäó áóßõãú ÁóÇíóÉñ</div><br>  (There has already been a sign for you) meaning, O Jews, who said what you said! You have an Ayah, meaning proof, that Allah will make His religion prevail, award victory to His Messenger, make His Word apparent and His religion the highest.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöí İöÆóÊóíúäö</div><br>  (In the two armies) meaning, two camps,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÊóŞóÊóÇ</div><br>  (that met) in combat (in Badr),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöÆóÉñ ÊõŞóÜÊöáõ İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (One was fighting in the Cause of Allah) the Muslims,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõÎúÑóì ßóÇİöÑóÉñ</div><br>  (And as for the other, in disbelief) meaning, the idolators of Quraysh at Badr. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÑóæúäóåõãú ãøöËúáóíúåöãú ÑóÃúìó ÇáúÚóíúäö</div><br>  (They saw them with their own eyes twice their number) means, the idolators thought that the Muslims were twice as many as they were, for Allah made this illusion a factor in the victory that Islam had over them.  It was said that the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÑóæúäóåõãú ãøöËúáóíúåöãú ÑóÃúìó ÇáúÚóíúäö</div><br>  (They saw them with their own eyes twice their number) is that the Muslims saw twice as many idolators as they were, yet Allah gave them victory over the disbelievers. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "When we looked at the disbelievers' forces, we found that they were twice as many as we were. When we looked at them again, we thought they did not have one man more than we had. So Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú íõÑöíßõãõæåõãú ÅöĞö ÇáúÊóŞóíúÊõãú İöì ÃóÚúíõäößõãú ŞóáöíáÇğ æóíõŞóáøöáõßõãú İöì ÃóÚúíõäöåöãú</div><br>  (And (remember) when you met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes and He made you appear as few in their eyes.) 8:44''.  When the two camps saw each other, the Muslims thought that the idolators were twice as many as they were, so that they would trust in Allah and seek His help. The idolators thought that the believers were twice as many as they were, so that they would feel fear, horror, fright and despair. When the two camps stood in lines and met in battle, Allah made each camp look smaller in the eyes of the other camp, so that they would be encouraged to fight each other,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíóŞúÖöíó Çááøóåõ ÃóãúÑÇğ ßóÇäó ãóİúÚõæáÇğ</div><br>  (so that Allah might accomplish a matter already ordained.) 8:42 meaning, so that the truth and falsehood are distinguishable, and thus the word of faith prevails over disbelief and deviation, so that the believers prevail and the disbelievers are humiliated. In a similar statement, Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú äóÕóÑóßõãõ Çááøóåõ ÈöÈóÏúÑò æóÃóäÊõãú ÃóĞöáøóÉñ</div><br>  (And Allah has already made you victorious at Badr, when you were a weak little force) 3:123. In this Ayah 3:13 Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íõÄóíøöÏõ ÈöäóÕúÑöåö ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áóÚöÈúÑóÉğ áÇæúáöì ÇáÇøñÈúÕóÜÑö</div><br>  (And Allah supports with His victory whom He wills. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand.) meaning, this should be an example for those who have intelligence and sound comprehension. They should contemplate about Allah's wisdom, decisions and decree, that He gives victory to His believing servants in this life and on the Day the witnesses stand up to testify.  </div></body></html>
