In reality, they were not Muslims, but rather the opposite. This is why Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóßó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞõæäó ŞóÇáõæÇú äóÔúåóÏõ Åöäøóßó áóÑóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö</div><br>  (When the hypocrites come to you, they say: "We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah.'') meaning, `when the hypocrites come to you, they announce this statement and pretend to believe in it.' Allah informs that there is no substance to their statement, and this is why He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóÚúáóãõ Åöäøóßó áóÑóÓõæáõåõ</div><br>  (Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger,) then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóÔúåóÏõ Åöäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó áóßóÜĞöÈõæäó</div><br>  (And Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars indeed.) meaning, their claims, even though it is true about the Prophet. But they did not believe inwardly in what they declared outwardly, and this is why Allah declared their falsehood about their creed. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÊøóÎóĞúæÇú ÃóíúãóÜäóåõãú ÌõäøóÉğ İóÕóÏøõæÇú Úóä ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (They have made their oaths a screen. Thus they hinder (others) from the path of Allah.) meaning, the hypocrites shield themselves from Muslims when they falsely and sinfully swear to be what they are not in reality. Some Muslims were deceived because they did not know their falsehood, and thus, thought that they were Muslims. Some Muslims believed what hypocrites say and even imitated them in their outward behavior. However, inwardly, hypocrites seek the destruction of Islam and its people, and this is why trusting them might bring great harm to many people. This is why Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÕóÏøõæÇú Úóä ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö Åöäøóåõãú ÓóÂÁó ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (Thus they hinder (others) from the path of Allah. Verily, evil is what they used to do.) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú ÁóÇãóäõæÇø Ëõãøó ßóİóÑõæÇ İóØõÈöÚó Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú İóåõãú áÇó íóİúŞóåõæäó </div><br>  (That is because they believed, and then disbelieved; therefore their hearts are sealed, so they understand not.) meaning, He has decreed them to be hypocrites because they reverted from faith to disbelief and exchanged guidance for misguidance. Therefore, Allah stamped and sealed their hearts and because of it, they cannot comprehend the guidance, nor any goodness can reach their hearts. Truly, their hearts neither understand, nor attain guidance. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóíúÊóåõãú ÊõÚúÌöÈõßó ÃóÌúÓóÜãõåõãú æóÅöä íóŞõæáõæÇú ÊóÓúãóÚú áöŞóæúáöåöãú</div><br>  (And when you look at them, their bodies please you; and when they speak, you listen to their words.) meaning, hypocrites have a graceful outer appearance and are eloquent. When one hears them speak, he will listen to their eloquent words, even though hypocrites are truly weak and feeble, full of fear, fright and cowardice. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÍúÓóÈõæäó ßõáøó ÕóíúÍóÉò Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (They think that every cry is against them.) means, every time an incident occurs or something frightening happens, they think that it is headed their way. This is indicative of their cowardice, just as Allah said about them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÔöÍøóÉğ Úóáóíúßõãú İóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁó ÇáúÎóæúİõ ÑóÃóíúÊóåõãú íóäÙõÑõæäó Åöáóíúßó ÊóÏæÑõ ÃóÚúíõäõåõãú ßóÇáøóĞöì íõÛúÔóì Úóáóíúåö ãöäó ÇáúãóæúÊö İóÅöĞóÇ ĞóåóÈó ÇáúÎóæúİõ ÓóáóŞõæßõã ÈöÃóáúÓöäóÉò ÍöÏóÇÏò ÃóÔöÍøóÉğ Úóáóì ÇáúÎóíúÑö ÃæúáóÜÆößó áóãú íõÄúãöäõæÇú İóÃóÍúÈóØó Çááøóåõ ÃóÚúãóÜáóåõãú æóßóÇäó Ğóáößó Úóáóì Çááøóåö íóÓöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (Being miserly towards you then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like (those of) one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, miserly towards good. Such have not believed. Therefore Allah makes their deeds fruitless and that is ever easy for Allah.) (33:19) They are shapes that do not have much substance, and this is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõãõ ÇáúÚóÏõæøõ İóÇÍúĞóÑúåõãú ŞóÇÊóáóåõãõ Çááøóåõ Ãóäøóì íõÄúİóßõæäó</div><br>  (They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allah curse them! How are they denying the right path) means, how they are being led astray to the misguidance, away from the guidance. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó áöáúãõäóÇİöŞöíäó ÚóáóÇãóÇÊò íõÚúÑóİõæäó ÈöåóÇ: ÊóÍöíøóÊõåõãú áóÚúäóÉñ æóØóÚóÇãõåõãú äõåúÈóÉñ æóÛóäöíãóÊõåõãú Ûõáõæáñ áóÇ íóŞúÑóÈõæäó ÇáúãóÓóÇÌöÏó ÅöáøóÇ åóÌúÑğÇ¡ æóáóÇ íóÃúÊõæäó ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó ÅöáøóÇ ÏóÈúÑğÇ¡ ãõÓúÊóßúÈöÑöíäó áóÇ íóÃúáóİõæäó æóáóÇ íõÄúáóİõæäó¡ ÎõÔõÈñ ÈöÇááøóíúáö ÕõÎõÈñ ÈöÇáäøóåóÇÑö æİöí ÑöæóÇíóÉò ÓõÎõÈñ ÈöÇáäøóåóÇÑ»</div><br>  (Hypocrites have certain signs that they are known by. Their greeting is really a curse, their food is from stealing and the war booty they collect is from theft. They shun the Masjid and they do not come to the prayer but at its end. They are arrogant; it is neither easy for them to blend in, nor it is easy for people to blend with them. They are like pieces of wood by night and are noisy by day.)  </div></body></html>
