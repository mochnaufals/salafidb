This is how We explain the Ayat and make them plain and clear in all circumstances, to suffice the ignorance of the ignorant; and so that the idolators and disbelievers who deny you say, `O Muhammad! You have Darasta with those who were before you from among the People of the Book and learned with them'. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said similarly. At-Tabarani narrated that `Amr bin Kaysan said that he heard Ibn `Abbas saying, "Darasta, means, `recited, argued and debated.''' This is similar to Allah's statement about the denial and rebellion of the disbelievers, e   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú Åöäú åóÜĞóÇ ÅöáÇøó Åöİúßñ ÇİúÊóÑóÇåõ æóÃóÚóÇäóåõ Úóáóíúåö Şóæúãñ ÁóÇÎóÑõæäó İóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁõæÇ ÙõáúãÇğ æóÒõæÑÇğ - æóŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóÓóÜØöíÑõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó ÇßúÊóÊóÈóåóÇ İóåöìó Êõãúáóì Úóáóíúåö ÈõßúÑóÉğ æóÃóÕöíáÇğ </div><br>  (Those who disbelieve say, "This (the Qur'an) is nothing but a lie that he has invented, and others have helped him at it, so that they have produced an unjust wrong (thing) and a lie.''
