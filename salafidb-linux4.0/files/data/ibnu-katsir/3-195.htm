Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Salamah, a man from the family of Umm Salamah said, "Umm Salamah said, `O Messenger of Allah! Allah does not mention women in connection with Hijrah (Migration).' Allah sent down the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÓúÊóÌóÇÈó áóåõãú ÑóÈøõåõãú Ãóäøöì áÇó ÃõÖöíÚõ Úóãóáó ÚóÇãöáò ãøöäúßõãú ãøöä ĞóßóÑò Ãóæú ÃõäËóì</div><br>  (So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), "Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female.)  The Ansar say that Umm Salamah was the first woman to migrate to them.'' Al-Hakim collected this Hadith in his Mustadrak, and said, "It is Sahih according to the criteria of Al-Bukhari but they Al-Bukhari and Muslim did not collect it''.

Rather, He will completely reward each person for his or her good deeds. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóÚúÖõßõã ãøöä ÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (You are (members) one of another) means, you are all equal in relation to gaining My reward.

Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÜÊóáõæÇú æóŞõÊöáõæÇú</div><br>  (and who fought and were killed (in My cause),) 3:195 refers to the highest rank there is, that one fights in the cause of Allah and dies in the process, with his face covered in dust and blood.

If I was killed in Allah's cause, observing patience, awaiting Allah's reward, attacking, not retreating, would Allah forgive my sins' The Prophet said, `Yes.' The Prophet then asked the man, `What did you ask' When the man repeated the question, the Prophet said, `Yes, except for the debt, for Jibril conveyed this to me right now'.)  This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÃõßóİøöÑóäøó Úóäúåõãú ÓóíøöÆóÜÊöåöãú æóáÃÏúÎöáóäøóåõãú ÌóäøóÜÊò ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÇ ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ</div><br>  (verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow), within Paradise, where there are rivers of various drinks: milk, honey, wine and fresh water.

Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ËóæóÇÈÇğ ãøöä ÚöäÏö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (a reward from Allah) testifies to His might, for the Mighty and Most Great only gives tremendous rewards.
