By then, Zakariyya had become an old man, his bones feeble and his head full of gray hair. His wife was an old women who was barren. Yet, he still supplicated to Allah and called Him in secret,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö åóÈú áöì ãöä áøóÏõäúßó</div><br>  (O my Lord! Grant me from Ladunka,) from You,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ĞõÑøöíøóÉğ ØóíøöÈóÉğ</div><br>  (A good offspring) meaning, a righteous offspring,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßó ÓóãöíÚõ ÇáÏøõÚóÂÁö</div><br>  (You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóäóÇÏóÊúåõ ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ æóåõæó ŞóÇÆöãñ íõÕóáøöì İöì ÇáúãöÍúÑóÇÈö</div><br>  (Then the angels called him, while he was standing in prayer in the Mihrab,) meaning, the angels spoke to him directly while he was secluded, standing in prayer at his place of worship. Allah told us about the good news that the angels delivered to Zakariyya,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøó Çááøóåó íõÈóÔøöÑõßó ÈöíóÍúíóÜì</div><br>  (Allah gives you glad tidings of Yahya, ) of a child from your offspring, his name is Yahya. Qatadah and other scholars said that he was called Yahya (literally, `he lives') because Allah filled his life with faith.  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÕóÏøöŞÇğ ÈößóáöãóÉò ãøöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (believing in the Word from Allah) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, and also Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Abu Ash-Sha`tha, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak, and several others said that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÕóÏøöŞÇğ ÈößóáöãóÉò ãøöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (believing in the Word from Allah) means, "Believing in `Isa, son of Maryam.''  Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Qatadah and Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóíøöÏğÇ</div><br>  (And Sayyidan) means, a wise man. Ibn `Abbas, Ath-Thawri and Ad-Dahhak said that Sayyidan means, "The noble, wise and pious man.'' Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said that Sayyid is the scholar and Faqih. `Atiyah said that Sayyid is the man noble in behavior and piety. `Ikrimah said that it refers to a person who is not overcome by anger, while Ibn Zayd said that it refers to the noble man. Mujahid said that Sayyidan means, honored by Allah.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍóÕõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (And Hasuran) does not mean he refrains from sexual relations with women, but that he is immune from illegal sexual relations. This does not mean that he does not marry women and have legal sexual relations with them, for Zakariyya said in his supplication for the benefit of Yahya,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÈú áöì ãöä áøóÏõäúßó ĞõÑøöíøóÉğ ØóíøöÈóÉğ</div><br>  (Grant me from You, a good offspring), meaning, grant me a son who will have offspring, and Allah knows best.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÈöíøğÇ ãøöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó</div><br>  (A Prophet, from among the righteous) delivers more good news of sending Yahya as Prophet after the good news that he will be born. This good news was even better than the news of Yahya's birth. In a similar statement, Allah said to the mother of Musa,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÑóÂÏøõæåõ Åöáóíúßö æóÌóÜÚöáõæåõ ãöäó ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of the Messengers.) 28:7  When Zakariyya heard the good news, he started contemplating about having children at his age. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÑóÈøö Ãóäøóì íóßõæäõ áöí ÛõáóÜãñ æóŞóÏú ÈóáóÛóäöí ÇáúßöÈóÑõ æóÇãúÑóÃóÊöì ÚóÇŞöÑñ ŞóÇáó</div><br>  ("O my Lord! How can I have a son when I am very old, and my wife is barren'' (He) said...) meaning the angel said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó Çááøóåõ íóİúÚóáõ ãóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  ("Thus Allah does what He wills.'') meaning, this is Allah's matter, He is so Mighty that nothing escapes His power, nor is anything beyond His ability.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÑóÈøö ÇÌúÚóá áøöì ÁóÇíóÉğ</div><br>  (He said: "O my Lord! Make a sign for me'') meaning make a sign that alerts me that the child will come,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÁóÇíóÊõßó ÃóáÇøó Êõßóáøöãó ÇáäøóÇÓó ËóáóÜËóÉó ÃóíøóÇãò ÅöáÇøó ÑóãúÒğÇ</div><br>  ((Allah) said: "Your sign is that you shall not speak to the people for three days except by signals.'') meaning, you will not be able to speak except with signals, although you are not mute. In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ËóáóÜËó áóíóÇáò ÓóæöíøÇğ</div><br>  (For three nights, though having no bodily defect.) 19:10  Allah then commanded Zakariyya to supplicate, thank and praise Him often in that condition,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇĞúßõÑ ÑøóÈøóßó ßóËöíÑğÇ æóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÇáúÚóÔöìøö æóÇáÅöÈúßóÜÑö</div><br>  (And remember your Lord much and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning. )  We will elaborate more on this subject in the beginning of Surah Maryam (chapter 19), Allah willing.  </div></body></html>
