Varying forms of the verb are used here in the Arabic text to reflect the difficulty of the action referred to.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ÇÓúØóÜÚõæÇú Ãóä íóÙúåóÑõæåõ æóãóÇ ÇÓúÊóØóÜÚõæÇú áóåõ äóŞúÈğÇ </div><br>  (So they (Ya'juj and Ma'juj) could not scale it or dig through it.)  This indicates that they could not penetrate it or dig through it. Imam Ahmad recorded that Zaynab bint Jahsh, the wife of the Prophet said, "The Prophet woke from sleep, and he was red in the face. He said,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ Åöáóåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ æóíúáñ áöáúÚóÑóÈö ãöäú ÔóÑó ŞóÏö ÇŞúÊóÑóÈó İõÊöÍó Çáúíóæúãó ãöäú ÑóÏúãö íóÃúÌõæÌó æóãóÃúÌõæÌó ãöËúáõ åóĞóÇ»</div><br>  (La ilaha illallah! Woe to the Arabs from the evil that has approached (them). Today a hole has been opened in the barrier of Ya'juj and Ma'juj like this.) and he made a circle with his index finger and thumb. I Zaynab said, `O Messenger of Allah, will we be destroyed even though there will be righteous people among us' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú ÅöĞóÇ ßóËõÑó ÇáúÎóÈóË»</div><br>  (Yes, if evil increases.)'' This is a Sahih Hadith, both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó åóÜĞóÇ ÑóÍúãóÉñ ãøöä ÑøóÈøöì</div><br>  ((Dhul-Qarnayn) said: "This is a mercy from my Lord...'') meaning, after it was built by Dhul-Qarnayn.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó åóÜĞóÇ ÑóÍúãóÉñ ãøöä ÑøóÈøöì</div><br>  (He said: This is a mercy from my Lord) for the people, when he placed a barrier between them and Ya'juj and Ma'juj, to stop them from spreading evil and corruption on earth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁó æóÚúÏõ ÑóÈøöì</div><br>  (but when the promise of my Lord comes) means, when the true promise comes   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌóÚóáóåõ ÏóßøóÂÁó</div><br>  (He shall Dakka' it down to the ground.) means, will make it flat. The Arabs use Dakka' to describe a female camel whose back is flat and has no hump. And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÊóÌóáøóì ÑóÈøõåõ áöáúÌóÈóáö ÌóÚóáóåõ ÏóßøğÇ</div><br>  (So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it Dakkan) 7:143 meaning, level to the ground.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó æóÚúÏõ ÑóÈøöì ÍóŞøÇğ</div><br>  (And the promise of my Lord is ever true.) means, it will come to pass without a doubt.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóßúäóÇ ÈóÚúÖóåõãú</div><br>  (We shall leave some of them) meaning mankind, on that day, the day when the barrier will be breached and these people (Ya'juj and Ma'juj) will come out surging over mankind to destroy their wealth and property.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóßúäóÇ ÈóÚúÖóåõãú íóæúãóÆöĞò íóãõæÌõ İöì ÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (We shall leave some of them to surge like waves on one another;) As-Suddi said: "That is when they emerge upon the people.'' All of this will happen before the Day of Resurrection and after the Dajjal, as we will explain when discussing the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ İõÊöÍóÊú íóÃúÌõæÌõ æóãóÃúÌõæÌõ æóåõãú ãøöä ßõáøö ÍóÏóÈò íóäÓöáõæäó æóÇŞúÊóÑóÈó ÇáúæóÚúÏõ ÇáúÍóŞøõ</div><br>  (Until, when Ya'juj and Ma'juj are let loose, and they swoop down from every Hadab.

As-Sur, as explained in the Hadith, is a horn that is blown into. The one who will blow into it is (the angel) Israfil, peace be upon him, as has been explained in the Hadith quoted at length above, and there are many Hadiths on this topic. According to a Hadith narrated from `Atiyah from Ibn `Abbas and Abu Sa`id, and attributed to the Prophet ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóíúİó ÃóäúÚóãõ æóÕóÇÍöÈõ ÇáúŞóÑúäö ŞóÏö ÇáúÊóŞóãó ÇáúŞóÑúäó æóÍóäóì ÌóÈúåóÊóåõ æóÇÓúÊóãóÚó ãóÊóì íõÄúãóÑõ¿»</div><br>  (How can I relax when the one with the Horn has put the Horn in his mouth and has knelt down, listening out for the command to be given to him) They said, "What should we say" He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞõæáõæÇ: ÍóÓúÈõäóÇ Çááåõ æóäöÚúãó Çáúæóßöíáõ Úóáóì Çááåö ÊóæóßøóáúäóÇ»</div><br>  (Say: "Allah is Sufficient for us and the best Disposer of affairs, in Allah have we put our trust.'')   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÌóãóÚúäóÜåõãú ÌóãúÚÇğ</div><br>  (and We shall collect them (the creatures) all together.) means, `We shall bring them all together for Reckoning.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Åöäøó ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó æóÇáÇøñÎöÑöíäó - áóãóÌúãõæÚõæäó Åöáóì ãöíŞóÜÊö íóæúãò ãøóÚúáõæãò </div><br>  (Say: "(Yes) verily, those of old, and those of later times.
