We discussed this before in the explanation of Surat Al-A`raf, so it is not necessary to repeat the meaning here. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ íóáúÌõ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (He knows what goes into the earth), indicates His knowledge in the amount of seeds and drops of water that enter inside the earth's surface,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÎúÑõÌõ ãöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (and what comes forth from it) of plants, vegetation and fruits. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚöäÏóåõ ãóİóÇÊöÍõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö áÇó íóÚúáóãõåóÂ ÅöáÇøó åõæó æóíóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ İöì ÇáúÈóÑøö æóÇáúÈóÍúÑö æóãóÇ ÊóÓúŞõØõ ãöä æóÑóŞóÉò ÅöáÇøó íóÚúáóãõåóÇ æóáÇó ÍóÈøóÉò İöì ÙõáõãóÜÊö ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóáÇó ÑóØúÈò æóáÇó íóÇÈöÓò ÅöáÇøó İöì ßöÊóÜÈò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  (And with Him are the keys of all that is hidden, none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but He knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.)(6:59) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóäÒöáõ ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö</div><br>  (and what descends from the heaven), pertains to rain, snow, hail and whatever Allah decides descends from heaven of decisions and commandments brought down by the honorable angels. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÚúÑõÌõ İöíåóÇ</div><br>  (and what ascends thereto.), refers to angels and deeds. In the Sahih, there is a Hadith in which the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÑúİóÚõ Åöáóíúåö Úóãóáõ Çááøóíúáö ŞóÈúáó ÇáäøóåóÇÑö¡ æóÚóãóáõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑö ŞóÈúáó Çááøóíúá»</div><br>  (To Him ascend the deeds of the night before the day falls and the deeds of the day before the night falls.)

And Allah is the All-Seer of what you do.) meaning, He is watching over you and witnessing your deeds wherever you may be, on land or at sea, during the night or the day, at home or in open areas or deserts. All of that is the same before His knowledge and all of it is under His sight and hearing. He hears your speech and sees where you are. He knows your secrets and your public statements,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇ Åöäøóåõãú íóËúäõæäó ÕõÏõæÑóåõãú áöíóÓúÊóÎúİõæÇú ãöäúåõ ÃóáÇ Íöíäó íóÓúÊóÛúÔõæäó ËöíóÇÈóåõãú íóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ íõÓöÑøõæäó æóãóÇ íõÚúáöäõæäó Åöäøóåõ Úóáöíãñ ÈöĞóÇÊö ÇáÕøõÏõæÑö </div><br>  (No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All-Knower of the (secrets) of the breasts. )(11:5) Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóæóÂÁñ ãøöäúßõãú ãøóäú ÃóÓóÑøó ÇáúŞóæúáó æóãóäú ÌóåóÑó Èöåö æóãóäú åõæó ãõÓúÊóÎúİò ÈöÇáøóíúáö æóÓóÇÑöÈñ ÈöÇáäøóåóÇÑö </div><br>  (It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day.)(13:10) Surely, there is no deity worthy of worship, except Allah. In the Sahih, there is a Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah answered Jibril, when he asked him about Ihsan:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóäú ÊóÚúÈõÏó Çááåó ßóÃóäøóßó ÊóÑóÇåõ¡ İóÅöäú áóãú Êóßõäú ÊóÑóÇåõ İóÅöäøóåõ íóÑóÇß»</div><br>  (To worship Allah as if you see Him, and even though you cannot see Him, He surely sees you.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóåõ ãõáúßõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÅöáóì Çááøóåö ÊõÑúÌóÚõ ÇáÇøòãõæÑõ </div><br>  (His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.

Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó áóäóÇ áóáÇøñÎöÑóÉó æóÇáÇøòæáóì </div><br>  (And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world).)(92:13) Surely, Allah is praised for this attribute, just as He said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó Çááøóåõ áÇ ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó áóåõ ÇáúÍóãúÏõ İöì ÇáÇøòæáóì æóÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö</div><br>  (And He is Allah, La ilaha illa Huwa, all praise is His in the first and in the last.)(28:70), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö ÇáøóĞöì áóåõ ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóáóåõ ÇáúÍóãúÏõ İöì ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö æóåõæó ÇáúÍóßöíãõ ÇáúÎóÈöíÑõ </div><br>  (All the praise is Allah's, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. His is all the praise in the Hereafter, and He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware.)(34:1) Allah owns everything that is in the heavens and earth, and all their inhabitants are servants to Him and humble before Him, just as He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ßõáøõ ãóä İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöáÇøó ÂÊöì ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÚóÈúÏÇğ - áøóŞóÏú ÃóÍúÕóÜåõãú æóÚóÏøóåõãú ÚóÏøÇğ - æóßõáøõåõãú ÁóÇÊöíåö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö İóÑúÏÇğ </div><br>  (There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And every one of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) (19:93-95) This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöáóì Çááøóåö ÊõÑúÌóÚõ ÇáÃõãõæÑõ</div><br>  (And to Allah return all the matters.) meaning that all matters will be referred to Him on the Day of Resurrection and He will judge His creation as He wills. Indeed, He is the Most Just, Who never falls into injustice, not even the weight of a speck of dust; if one performs even one good deed, Allah will multiply it up to ten times,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÄúÊö ãöä áøóÏõäúåõ ÃóÌúÑÇğ ÚóÙöíãÇğ</div><br>  (and gives from Him a great reward. )(4:40),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÖóÚõ ÇáúãóæóÒöíäó ÇáúŞöÓúØó áöíóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö İóáÇó ÊõÙúáóãõ äóİúÓñ ÔóíúÆÇğ æóÅöä ßóÇäó ãöËúŞóÇáó ÍóÈøóÉò ãøöäú ÎóÑúÏóáò ÃóÊóíúäóÇ ÈöåóÇ æóßóİóì ÈöäóÇ ÍóÜÓöÈöíäó </div><br>  (And We shall set up Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And sufficent are We to take account.)(21:47) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõæáöÌõ Çáøóíúáó İöì ÇáäøóåóÇÑö æóíõæáöÌõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑó İöì Çáøóíúáö</div><br>  (He merges night into day, and merges day into night,) meaning, He does what He wills with His creatures. He alternates the night and day and measures them by His wisdom, as He wills. Sometimes, He makes the night longer than the day, and sometimes the opposite. Sometimes, He makes the length of night and day equal. Sometimes, He makes the season winter, then changes it to spring, then summer then autumn. All this He does by His wisdom and His due measure of everything in His creation,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó Úóáöíãñ ÈöĞóÇÊö ÇáÕøõÏõæÑö</div><br>  (and He has full knowledge of whatsoever is in the breasts.) He knows the secrets, no matter how concealed they are.  </div></body></html>
