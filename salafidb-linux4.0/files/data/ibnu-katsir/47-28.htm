Ibn Jarir recorded from Hisham bin `Urwah, from his father, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger once recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó íóÊóÏóÈøóÑõæäó ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäó Ãóãú Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈò ÃóŞúİóÇáõåóÂ </div><br>  (Will they not then reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon their hearts) and a young man from Yemen said, "Indeed, there are locks upon them -- until Allah opens them totally or slightly.'' After that `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, always liked that young man, and kept that to himself until he became in charge, upon which he utilized him (as a consultant). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Condemning Apostasy</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÑúÊóÏøõæÇú Úóáóì ÃóÏúÈóÜÑöåöãú</div><br>  (Verily, those who have turned back) meaning, they departed from the faith and returned to disbelief.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÊóÈóíøóäó áóåõãõ ÇáúåõÏóì ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ Óóæøóáó áóåõãú</div><br>  (... after guidance had become clear to them -- Shaytan has enticed them) meaning he adorned and beautified that (apostasy) for them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãúáóì áóåõãú</div><br>  (and filled them with false hopes.) meaning, he tempted them, and deceived them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú ŞóÇáõæÇú áöáøóĞöíäó ßóÑöåõæÇú ãóÇ äóÒøóáó Çááøóåõ ÓóäõØöíÚõßõãú İöì ÈóÚúÖö ÇáÇøñãúÑö</div><br>  (That is because they said to those who hate what Allah sent down: "We will obey your in part of the matter.'') means, they plotted secretly with them and gave them evil advice -- as is the common practice of the hypocrites who declare the opposite of what they conceal. Because of this, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóÚúáóãõ ÅöÓúÑóÇÑóåõãú</div><br>  (And Allah knows their secrets. ) whatever they hide and conceal, Allah is well-acquainted with it and He knows it.

This is similar to Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÊóÑóì ÅöĞú íóÊóæóİøóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ íóÖúÑöÈõæäó æõÌõæåóåõãú æóÃóÏúÈóÜÑóåõãú</div><br>  (If you could but see when the angels take away the lives of the disbelievers, striking their faces and their backs.)
