Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, As-Suddi, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurrasani, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Khusayf Al-Jazari. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Refraining from Joining Jihad is a Sign of Hypocrites</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ãöäúßõãú áóãóä áøóíõÈóØøöÆóäøó</div><br>  (There is certainly among you he who would linger behind.) Mujahid and others said that this Ayah was revealed about the hypocrites. Muqatil bin Hayyan said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíõÈóØøöÆóäøó</div><br>  (linger behind) means, stays behind and does not join Jihad. It is also possible that this person himself lingers behind, while luring others away from joining Jihad. For instance, `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, may Allah curse him, used to linger behind and lure other people to do the same and refrain from joining Jihad, as Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Jarir stated. This is why Allah said about the hypocrite, that when he lingers behind from Jihad, then:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäú ÃóÕóÜÈóÊúßõãú ãøõÕöíÈóÉñ</div><br>  (If a misfortune befalls you) death, martyrdom, or - by Allah's wisdom - being defeated by the enemy,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ŞóÏú ÃóäúÚóãó Çááøóåõ Úóáóìøó ÅöĞú áóãú Ãóßõäú ãøóÚóåõãú ÔóåöíÏÇğ</div><br>  (he says, "Indeed Allah has favored me that I was not present among them.'') meaning, since I did not join them in battle. Because he considers this one of Allah's favors on him, unaware of the reward that he might have gained from enduring war or martyrdom, if he was killed.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöäú ÃóÕóÜÈóßõãú İóÖúáñ ãöäó Çááå</div><br>  (But if a bounty comes to you from Allah) such as victory, triumph and booty,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíóŞõæáóäøó ßóÃóä áøóãú Êóßõäú Èóíúäóßõãú æóÈóíúäóåõ ãóæóÏøóÉñ</div><br>  (he would surely say - as if there had never been ties of affection between you and him,) meaning, as if he was not a follower of your religion,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íáóíÊóäöì ßõäÊõ ãóÚóåõãú İóÃóİõæÒó İóæúÒÇğ ÚóÙöíãÇğ</div><br>  ("Oh!

This is his ultimate aim and objective. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Encouragement to Participation in Jihad</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáúíõŞóÇÊöáú</div><br>  (So fight) the believer with an aversion (to fighting),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÔúÑõæäó ÇáúÍóíóæÉó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÈöÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö</div><br>  (those who trade the life of this world with the Hereafter) referring to those sell their religion for the meager goods of the world, and they only do this because of their disbelief and lack of faith.

The Two Sahihs recorded,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÊóßóİøóáó Çááåõ áöáúãõÌóÇåöÏö İöí ÓóÈöíáöåö¡ Åöäú ÊóæóİøóÇåõ Ãóäú íõÏúÎöáóåõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó¡ Ãóæú íóÑúÌöÚóåõ Åöáì ãóÓúßóäöåö ÇáøóĞöí ÎóÑóÌó ãöäúåõ¡ ÈöãóÇ äóÇáó ãöäú ÃóÌúÑò Ãóæú ÛóäöíãóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah has guaranteed the Mujahid in His cause that He will either bring death to him, admitting into Paradise; or, He will help him return safely to his home with whatever reward and booty he gained.)  </div></body></html>
