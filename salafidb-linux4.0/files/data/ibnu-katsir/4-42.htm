Rather, Allah shall reward them for this action and multiply it, if it were a good deed. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÖóÚõ ÇáúãóæóÒöíäó ÇáúŞöÓúØó</div><br>  (And We shall set up balances of justice) Allah said that Luqman said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÈõäóìøó ÅöäøóåóÂ Åöä Êóßõ ãöËúŞóÇáó ÍóÈøóÉò ãøöäú ÎóÑúÏóáò İóÊóßõäú İöì ÕóÎúÑóÉò Ãóæú İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö Ãóæú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö íóÃúÊö ÈöåóÇ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (O my son!

So whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it.) The Two Sahihs recorded the long Hadith about the intercession that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri narrated, and in which the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóíóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó: ÇÑúÌöÚõæÇ¡ İóãóäú æóÌóÏúÊõãú İöí ŞóáúÈöåö ãöËúŞóÇáó ÍóÈøóÉö ÎóÑúÏóáò ãöäú ÅöíãóÇäò¡ İóÃóÎúÑöÌõæåõ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (Allah then says, "Go back, and take out of the Fire everyone in whose heart you find the weight of a mustard seed of faith'') In another narration, Allah says, æİí áİÙ:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÏúäóì ÃóÏúäóì ÃóÏúäóì ãöËúŞóÇáö ĞóÑøóÉò ãöäú ÅöíãóÇäò¡ İóÃóÎúÑöÌõæåõ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ İóíõÎúÑöÌõæäó ÎóáúŞğÇ ßóËöíÑğÇ»</div><br>  ("Whosoever had the least, least, least speck of faith, take him out of the Fire,'' and they will take out many people.) Abu Sa`id then said, "Read, if you will,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íóÙúáöãõ ãöËúŞóÇáó ĞóÑøóÉò</div><br>  (Surely!

He used as evidence the authentic Hadith in which Al-`Abbas said, "O Messenger of Allah! Your uncle Abu Talib used to protect and support you, did you benefit him at all'' The Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú åõæó İöí ÖóÍúÖóÇÍò ãöäú äóÇÑò¡ æóáóæúáóÇ ÃóäóÇ¡ áóßóÇäó İöí ÇáÏøóÑúßö ÇáúÃóÓúİóáö ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (Yes. He is in a shallow area in Hell-fire, and were it not for me, he would have been in the deepest depths of the Fire.) However, this Hadith only applies to Abu Talib, not the rest of the disbelievers. To support this, we mention what Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded in his Musnad that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó áóÇ íóÙúáöãõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäó ÍóÓóäóÉğ¡ íõËóÇÈõ ÚóáóíúåóÇ ÇáÑøöÒúŞó İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ æóíõÌúÒóì ÈöåóÇ İöí ÇáúÂÎöÑóÉö¡ æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáúßóÇİöÑõ İóíõØúÚóãõ ÈöåóÇ İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ßóÇäó íóæúãõ ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö áóãú íóßõäú áóåõ ÍóÓóäóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah does not wrong the faithful even concerning one good action, for he will be rewarded for it by provision in this life and awarded for it in the Hereafter. As for the disbeliever, he will be provided provision in this life for his good action, and on the Day of Resurrection, he will not have any good deed.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>What Does `Great Reward' Mean</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Abu Hurayrah, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÄúÊö ãöä áøóÏõäúåõ ÃóÌúÑÇğ ÚóÙöíãÇğ</div><br>  (and gives from Him a great reward.) refers to Paradise. We ask Allah for His pleasure and Paradise. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu `Uthman An-Nahdi said, "No other person accompanied Abu Hurayrah more than I. One year, he went to Hajj before me, and I found the people of Al-Basrah saying that he narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó íõÖóÇÚöİõ ÇáúÍóÓóäóÉó Ãóáúİó Ãóáúİö ÍóÓóäóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah rewards the good deed with a million deeds.) So I said, `Woe to you! No person accompanied Abu Hurayrah more than I, and I never heard him narrate this Hadith!' When I wanted to meet him, I found that he had left for Hajj so I followed him to Hajj to ask him about this Hadith.''  Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded this Hadith using another chain of narration leading to Abu `Uthman. In this narration, Abu `Uthman said, "I said, `O Abu Hurayrah! I heard my brethren in Al-Basrah claim that you narrated that you heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó íóÌúÒöí ÈöÇáúÍóÓóäóÉö Ãóáúİó Ãóáúİö ÍóÓóäóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah rewards the good deed with a million deeds.) Abu Hurayrah said, `By Allah!

Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "The Messenger of Allah said to me, `Recite to me.' I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Should I recite (the Qur'an) to you, while it was revealed to you' He said, `Yes, for I like to hear it from other people.' I recited Surat An-Nisa' until I reached this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóíúİó ÅöĞóÇ ÌöÆúäóÇ ãöä ßõáøö ÃãøóÉò ÈöÔóåöíÏò æóÌöÆúäóÇ Èößó Úóáóì åóÜÄõáÇÁö ÔóåöíÏÇğ </div><br>  (How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people) He then said, `Stop now.' I found that his eyes were tearful.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãóÆöĞò íóæóÏøõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóÚóÕóæõÇú ÇáÑøóÓõæáó áóæú ÊõÓóæøóì Èöåöãõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ æóáÇó íóßúÊõãõæäó Çááøóåó ÍóÏöíËÇğ </div><br>  (On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were buried in the earth, but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah.) means, they will wish that the earth would open up and swallow them because of the horror of the gathering place and the disgrace, dishonor and humiliation they will suffer on that Day. This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóäÙõÑõ ÇáúãóÑúÁõ ãóÇ ŞóÏøóãóÊú íóÏóÇåõ</div><br>  (The Day when man will see that (the deeds) which his hands have sent forth)  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóßúÊõãõæäó Çááøóåó ÍóÏöíËÇğ</div><br>  (but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah.) indicating that they will admit to everything they did and will not hide any of it. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "A man came to Ibn `Abbas and said to him, `There are things that confuse me in the Qur'an.' Ibn `Abbas said, `What things do you have doubts about in the Qur'an' He said, `Not doubts, but rather confusing things.' Ibn `Abbas said, `Tell me what caused you confusion.' He said, `I hear Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó áóãú Êóßõäú İöÊúäóÊõåõãú ÅöáÇøó Ãóä ŞóÇáõæÇú æóÇááøóåö ÑóÈøöäóÇ ãóÇ ßõäøóÇ ãõÔúÑößöíäó </div><br>  (There will then be no test for them but to say: "By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.'') but He also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóßúÊõãõæäó Çááøóåó ÍóÏöíËÇğ</div><br>  (but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah.) They have indeed hid something.' Ibn `Abbas said, `As for Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó áóãú Êóßõäú İöÊúäóÊõåõãú ÅöáÇøó Ãóä ŞóÇáõæÇú æóÇááøóåö ÑóÈøöäóÇ ãóÇ ßõäøóÇ ãõÔúÑößöíäó </div><br>  (There will then be no test for them but to say: "By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.''), when they see that on the Day of Resurrection that Allah does not forgive, except for the people of Islam, and that He forgives the sins, no matter how big they are, except Shirk, then the Mushriks will lie.
