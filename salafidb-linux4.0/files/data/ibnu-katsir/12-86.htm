So patience is most fitting (for me).) Muhammad bin Ishaq said, "When they went back to Ya`qub and told him what happened, he did not believe them and thought that this was a repetition of what they did to Yusuf. So he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ÓóæøóáóÊú áóßõãú ÃóäİõÓõßõãú ÃóãúÑğÇ İóÕóÈúÑñ Ìóãöíáñ</div><br>  (Nay, but your own selves have beguiled you into something. So patience is most fitting (for me).) Some said that since this new development came after what they did before to Yusuf, they were given the same judgement to this later incident that was given to them when they did what they did to Yusuf. Therefore, Ya`qub's statement here is befitting,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ÓóæøóáóÊú áóßõãú ÃóäİõÓõßõãú ÃóãúÑğÇ İóÕóÈúÑñ Ìóãöíáñ</div><br>  (Nay, but your own selves have beguiled you into something. So patience is most fitting (for me).) He then begged Allah to bring back his three sons: Yusuf, Binyamin and Rubil to him.'' Rubil had remained in Egypt awaiting Allah's decision about his case, either his father's permission ordering him to go back home, or to secure the release of his brother in confidence. This is why Ya`qub said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÓóì Çááøóåõ Ãóä íóÃúÊöíóäöì Èöåöãú ÌóãöíÚğÇ Åöäøóåõ åõæó ÇáúÚóáöíãõ</div><br>  (May be Allah will bring them (back) all to me. Truly, He! Only He is All-Knowing,), in my distress,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóßöíãõ</div><br>  (the All-Wise), in His decisions and the decree and preordainment He appoints. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóæóáøóì Úóäúåõãú æóŞóÇáó íÃóÓóİóÇ Úóáóì íõæÓõİó</div><br>  (And he turned away from them and said: "Alas, my grief for Yusuf!'') He turned away from his children and remembered his old grief for Yusuf,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóÓóİóÇ Úóáóì íõæÓõİó</div><br>  (Alas, my grief for Yusuf!) The new grief, losing Binyamin and Rubil, renewed his old sadness that he kept to himself. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ath-Thawri said that Sufyan Al-`Usfuri said that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "Only this nation the following of Prophet Muhammad  were given Al-Istirja'. Have you not heard the statement of Ya`qub, peace be upon him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóÓóİóÇ Úóáóì íõæÓõİó æóÇÈúíóÖøóÊú ÚóíúäóÇåõ ãöäó ÇáúÍõÒúäö İóåõæó ßóÙöíãñ</div><br>  ("Alas, my grief for Yusuf !'' And he lost his sight because of the sorrow that he was suppressing. )'' Ya`qub suppressed his sorrow and did not complain to a created being, according to Qatadah and other scholars. Ad-Dahhak also commented, "Ya`qub was aggrieved, sorrowful and sad.'' Ya`qub's children felt pity for him and said, while feeling sorrow and compassion,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÇááå ÊóİúÊóÃõ ÊóĞúßõÑõ íõæÓõİó</div><br>  (By Allah!

They said, `if you continue like this, we fear for you that you might die of grief,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóÔúßõæ ÈóËøöì æóÍõÒúäöì Åöáóì Çááøóåö</div><br>  (He said: "I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Allah.'') When they said these words to him, Ya`qub said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóÔúßõæ ÈóËøöì æóÍõÒúäöì</div><br>  `(I only complain of my grief and sorrow) for the afflictions that struck me,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì Çááøóåö</div><br>  (to Allah, ) alone,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÚúáóãõ ãöäó Çááøóåö ãóÇ áÇó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (and I know from Allah that which you know not.)

Ibn `Abbas commented on the meaning of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÚúáóãõ ãöäó Çááøóåö ãóÇ áÇó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (and I know from Allah that which you know not.) "The vision that Yusuf saw is truthful and Allah will certainly make it come true.''  </div></body></html>
