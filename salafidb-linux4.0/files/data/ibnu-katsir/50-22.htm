Allah the Exalted has complete knowledge of all thoughts that cross the mind of man, be they good or evil. In the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì ÊóÌóÇæóÒó áöÃõãøóÊöí ãóÇ ÍóÏøóËóÊú Èöåö ÃóäúİõÓóåóÇ ãóÇ áóãú ÊóŞõáú Ãóæú ÊóÚúãóá»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah the Exalted has forgiven my Ummah (Muslims) for what they talk (think) to themselves about, as long as they do not utter or implement it.) The statement of Allah the Exalted,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÍúäõ ÃóŞúÑóÈõ Åöáóíúåö ãöäú ÍóÈúáö ÇáúæóÑöíÏö</div><br>  (And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.) means, His angels are nearer to man than his jugular vein. Those who explained `We' in the Ayah to mean `Our knowledge,' have done so to avoid falling into the idea of incarnation or indwelling; but these two creeds are false according to the consensus of Muslims. Allah is praised and glorified, He is far hallowed beyond what they ascribe to Him. The words of this Ayah do not need this explanation (that `We' refers to `Allah's knowledge'), for Allah did not say, `and I am closer to him than his jugular vein.' Rather, He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÍúäõ ÃóŞúÑóÈõ Åöáóíúåö ãöäú ÍóÈúáö ÇáúæóÑöíÏö</div><br>  (And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. ) just as He said in the case of dying persons,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÍúäõ ÃóŞúÑóÈõ Åöáóíúåö ãöäßõãú æóáóÜßöä áÇøó ÊõÈúÕöÑõæäó </div><br>  (But We are nearer to him than you, but you see not.) (56:85), in reference to His angels (who take the souls). Allah the Exalted the Blessed said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ äóÍúäõ äóÒøóáúäóÇ ÇáĞøößúÑó æóÅöäøóÇ áóåõ áóÍóÜİöÙõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will guard it.) (15:9) Therefore, the angels brought down the revelation, the Qur'an, by the leave of Allah, the Exalted, the Most Honored. Thus, the angels are closer to man than his own jugular vein, by the power and leave of Allah. Consequently, the angel touches mankind, just as the devil touches them, for the devil is as close to them as the blood that runs in their veins; just as Allah's Prophet , who is truthful and was told the truth, told us. Allah's statement here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú íóÊóáóŞøóì ÇáúãõÊóáóŞøöíóÇäö</div><br>  ((Remember) that the two receivers receive,) in reference to the two angels who receive and record the deeds of mankind.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóäö Çáúíóãöíäö æóÚóäö ÇáÔøöãóÇáö ŞóÚöíÏñ</div><br>  (one sitting on the right and one on the left.) means ready to note,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ íóáúİöÙõ</div><br>  (whatever he utters), in reference to the human,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä Şóæúáò</div><br>  (of a word), means any word that he or she speaks,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó áóÏóíúåö ÑóŞöíÈñ ÚóÊöíÏñ</div><br>  (but there is a watcher by him ready.) means, but there is a scribe whose job is to record it, leaving no word or movement unrecorded. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó Úóáóíúßõãú áóÍóÜİöÙöíäó - ßöÑóÇãÇğ ßóÜÊöÈöíäó - íóÚúáóãõæäó ãóÇ ÊóİúÚóáõæäó </div><br>  (But verily, over you (are appointed angels) to watch you, Kiraman (honorable) Katibin writing down (your deeds), they know all that you do.) (82:10-12) Therefore, the scribe records every word that is spoken, according to the explanation of Al-Hasan and Qatadah. This is also the apparent meaning of this Ayah.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Bilal bin Al-Harith Al-Muzani said, "The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáó áóíóÊóßóáøóãõ ÈöÇáúßóáöãóÉö ãöäú ÑöÖúæóÇäö Çááåö ÊóÚóÇáóì ãóÇ íóÙõäøõ Ãóäú ÊóÈúáõÛó ãóÇ ÈóáóÛóÊú íóßúÊõÈõ Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó áóåõ ÈöåóÇ ÑöÖúæóÇäóåõ Åöáóì íóæúãö íóáúŞóÇåõ¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáó áóíóÊóßóáøóãõ ÈöÇáúßóáöãóÉö ãöäú ÓóÎóØö Çááåö ÊóÚóÇáóì ãóÇ íóÙõäøõ Ãóäú ÊóÈúáõÛó ãóÇ ÈóáóÛóÊú¡ íóßúÊõÈõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì Úóáóíúåö ÈöåóÇ ÓóÎóØóåõ Åöáóì íóæúãö íóáúŞóÇå»</div><br>  (Verily, a man might utter a word that pleases Allah the Exalted, unaware of how highly it will be regarded, and on its account Allah the Exalted and Most Honored decrees His pleasure of him until the Day he meets Him. A man might indeed utter a word that angers Allah the Exalted, unaware of how dreadful it will be and on its account Allah the Exalted decrees for him His anger until the Day he meets Him.)'' `Alqamah used to say, "How many words did I not utter because of the Hadith that Bilal bin Al-Harith narrated.'' At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih.'' There is a Hadith similar to this in the Sahih. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Reminding Mankind of the Stupor of Death, the Blast of the Trumpet and the Day of Gathering</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted and Most High said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÇÁóÊú ÓóßúÑóÉõ ÇáúãóæúÊö ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö Ğóáößó ãóÇ ßõäÊó ãöäúåõ ÊóÍöíÏõ </div><br>  (And the stupor of death will come in truth: "This is what you have been avoiding!'') Allah the Exalted and Most Honored says, `O mankind! This is the stupor of death that has come in truth; now, I have brought forth to you the certainty that you were disputing,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ãóÇ ßõäÊó ãöäúåõ ÊóÍöíÏõ</div><br>  (This is what you have been avoiding!), means, `this is the end that you were trying to escape; it has come to you! Therefore, you will have neither a shelter nor a refuge nor a sanctuary nor an asylum from it.' In the Sahih, the Prophet said, while wiping sweat from his face when the stupor of death overcame him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓõÈúÍóÇäó Çááåö Åöäøó áöáúãóæúÊö áóÓóßóÑóÇÊ»</div><br>  (Glory be to Allah! Verily, death has its stupor.) The Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ãóÇ ßõäÊó ãöäúåõ ÊóÍöíÏõ</div><br>  (This is what you have been avoiding!) has two possible meanings. One of them is this: `what you have been trying to avert, escape and flee from has come to you and resided in your home!' The second meaning is, `you had no way of escaping or averting this end. ' At-Tabarani collected a Hadith in Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir from Samurah who said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóËóáõ ÇáøóĞöí íóİöÑøõ ãöäó ÇáúãóæúÊö ãóËóáõ ÇáËøóÚúáóÈö ÊóØúáõÈõåõ ÇáúÃóÑúÖõ ÈöÏóíúä¡ İóÌóÇÁó íóÓúÚóì ÍóÊúì ÅöĞóÇ ÃõÚúíöíó æóÃõÓúåöÑó ÏóÎóáó ÌõÍúÑóåõ æóŞóÇáóÊú áóåõ ÇáúÃóÑúÖõ: íóÇ ËóÚúáóÈõ¡ Ïóíúäöí.

The fox went away and when he became tired and the time to sleep overtook him, he entered his den. The earth said to him, `O fox! Pay my debt!' The fox went out howling and continued until his neck was cutoff, (i.e.,) he died.) This parable indicates that just as the fox had no way of escaping or avoiding the earth, likewise, man has no way of avoiding death.  Allah the Exalted the Blessed said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõİöÎó İöì ÇáÕøõæÑö Ğóáößó íóæúãó ÇáúæóÚöíÏö </div><br>  (And the Trumpet will be blown -- that will be the Day of the threat.) Earlier we discussed the information about the blowing of the Trumpet, the fear that follows it, the death of everything and then resurrection, all this will occur on the Day of Resurrection. We also mentioned that the Messenger of Allah said in a Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóíúİó ÃóäúÚóãõ æóÕóÇÍöÈõ ÇáúŞóÑúäö ŞóÏö ÇáúÊóŞóãó ÇáúŞóÑúäó¡ æóÍóäóì ÌóÈúåóÊóåõ¡ æóÇäúÊóÙóÑó Ãóäú íõÄúĞóäó áóå»</div><br>  (How can I feel comfort while the angel responsible for the Trumpet has placed the Trumpet to his mouth and lowered his forehead awaiting when he will be commanded (by Allah to blow in it)) They said, "O Allah's Messenger, what should we say'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞõæáõæÇ ÍóÓúÈõäóÇ Çááåõ æóäöÚúãó Çáúæóßöíá»</div><br>  (Say, "Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.)'' The Companions repeated this invocation, saying, "Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs (for us).''

This is the apparent meaning of this honorable Ayah and it is the meaning that Ibn Jarir preferred. It was narrated from Yahya bin Rafi`, the freed servant of Thaqif, that he heard `Uthman bin `Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, giving a speech in which he recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÂÁóÊú ßõáøõ äóİúÓò ãøóÚóåóÇ ÓóÂÆöŞñ æóÔóåöíÏñ </div><br>  (And every person will come forth along with a Sa'iq and a Shahid.) and then said, "A Sa'iq to drive every person to Allah the Exalted, and a Shahid to witness against him what he has done.''
