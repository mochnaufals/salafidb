He gave him Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya`qub (Jacob), meaning his son, Ishaq, and Ishaq's son, Ya`qub. This is as Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÚúŞõæÈó äóÇİöáóÉğ</div><br>  (and Ya`qub, a grandson.) 21:72 Also, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä æóÑóÂÁö ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó íóÚúŞõæÈó</div><br>  (and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub.) 11:71 There is no difference of opinion about Ishaq being the father of Ya`qub. This is what is recorded in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Baqarah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ßõäÊõãú ÔõåóÏóÂÁó ÅöĞú ÍóÖóÑó íóÚúŞõæÈó ÇáúãóæúÊõ ÅöĞú ŞóÇáó áöÈóäöíåö ãóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó ãöä ÈóÚúÏöì ŞóÇáõæÇú äóÚúÈõÏõ ÅöáóÜåóßó æóÅöáóÜåó ÂÈóÂÆößó ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóÅöÓúãóÜÚöíáó æóÅöÓúÍóÜŞó</div><br>  (Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya`qub When he said unto his sons, "What will you worship after me" They said, "We shall worship your God the God of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma`il and Ishaq.'')2:133 Allah only mentioned Ishaq and Ya`qub here to show that He made Prophets from among his descendants and successors in order to give him relief and happiness in his life. This is why Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõáÇøğ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ äóÈöíøÇğ</div><br>  (and each one of them We made a Prophet.) 19:49 If Ya`qub had not become a Prophet in the lifetime of Ibrahim, then Allah would not have limited the promise of prophethood to him, but He would have mentioned his son Yusuf as well. For verily, Yusuf was also a Prophet, just as the Messenger of Allah said in a Hadith whose authenticity is agreed upon, when he was asked who was the best of people. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõæÓõİõ äóÈöíøõ Çááåö ÇÈúäõ íóÚúŞõæÈó äóÈöíøö Çááåö ÇÈúäö ÅöÓúÍóÇŞó äóÈöíøö Çááåö ÇÈúäö ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãó Îóáöíáö Çááå»</div><br>  (The Prophet of Allah, Yusuf, the son of the Prophet of Allah Ya`qub, the son of the Prophet of Allah Ishaq, the son of the Friend of Allah Ibrahim.) In another wording of this Hadith, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáúßóÑöíãó ÇÈúäó ÇáúßóÑöíãö ÇÈúäö ÇáúßóÑöíãö ÇÈúäö ÇáúßóÑöíãö íõæÓõİó Èúäó íóÚúŞõæÈó Èúäö ÅöÓúÍóÇŞó Èúäö ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíã»</div><br>  (Verily, the noble one is the son of the noble one, who is the son of the noble one, who is the son of the noble one. That is Yusuf, the son of Ya`qub, the son of Ishaq, the son of Ibrahim.)

As-Suddi and Malik bin Anas said the same thing. Ibn Jarir said, "Allah only said `Aliyyan (loftiness, exalted) because all of the religions commend them and mention them with praises, may Allah's peace and blessing be upon them all.''  </div></body></html>
