The Mothers of the believers are more entitled to be included in this category than any other chaste woman, especially the one who was the reason for this Ayah being revealed: `A'ishah bint As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with them both. All of the scholars agree that whoever slanders her or makes accusations against after what has been said in this Ayah, is a disbeliever, because of his being obstinate with the Qur'an. The same ruling applies to all of the Mothers of the believers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áõÚöäõæÇú İöì ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö</div><br>  (are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter,) This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÄúĞõæäó Çááøóåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ</div><br>  (Verily, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger,) 33:57 `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, "This is about `A'ishah, and whoever does anything similar nowadays to Muslim women, the same applies to him, but `A'ishah is the one who is primarily referred to here.''

They will say, `Come, let us deny (everything).' So they will deny (everything), then their mouths will be sealed and their hands and feet will testify against them, and they will not be able to hide anything from Allah.'' Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Anas bin Malik said, "We were with the Prophet and he smiled so broadly that his back teeth could be seen, then he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊóÏúÑõæäó ãöãøó ÃóÖúÍóßõ¿»</div><br>  (Do you know why I am smiling) We said, `Allah and His Messenger know best.'
