They believe in some Prophets and reject others, following their desires, lusts and the practices of their forefathers. They do not follow any proof for such distinction, because there is no such proof. Rather, they follow their lusts and prejudices. The Jews, may Allah curse them, believe in the Prophets, except `Isa and Muhammad, peace be upon them. The Christians believe in the Prophets but reject their Final and Seal, and the most honored among the prophets, Muhammad, peace be upon him. In addition, the Samirah (Samaritans) do not believe in any Prophet after Yuwsha` (Joshua), the successor of Musa bin `Imran. The Majus (Zoroastrians) are said to believe only in a Prophet called Zoroaster, although they do not believe in the law he brought them casting it behind them, and Allah knows best. Therefore, whoever rejects only one of Allah's Prophets, he will have disbelieved in all of them, because it is required from mankind to believe in every prophet whom Allah sent to the people of the earth. And whoever rejects one Prophet, out of envy, bias and personal whim, he only demonstrates that his faith in other Prophets is not valid, but an act of following desire and whim. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóßúİõÑõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóÑõÓõáöåö</div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers...) Thus, Allah describes these people as disbelievers in Allah and His Messengers;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÑöíÏõæäó Ãóä íõİóÑøöŞõæÇú Èóíúäó Çááøóåö æóÑõÓõáöåö</div><br>  (and wish to make distinction between Allah and His Messengers) in faith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíŞõæáõæäó äõÄúãöäõ ÈöÈóÚúÖò æóäóßúİõÑõ ÈöÈóÚúÖò æóíõÑöíÏõæäó Ãóä íóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú Èóíúäó Ğóáößó ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (saying, "We believe in some but reject others,'' and wish to adopt a way in between.) Allah then describes them;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó ÍóŞøÇğ</div><br>  (They are in truth disbelievers.) meaning, their disbelief in the Prophet they claim to believe in is clear. This is because their claimed faith in a certain Messenger is not true, for had they truly believed in him, they would have believed in other Messengers, especially if the other Messenger has a stronger proof for his truthfulness. Or at least, they would have strived hard to acquire knowledge of the truth of the other Messenger. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÚúÊóÏúäóÇ áöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÚóĞóÇÈÇğ ãøõåöíäÇğ</div><br>  (And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment.) This is just punishment for belittling the Prophets whom they disbelieved in, by ignoring what the Prophet brought to them from Allah, and because they are interested in the insignificant possessions of this world. Or, their behavior could be the result of their disbelief in the Prophet after they were aware of his truth, just as the Jewish rabbis did during the time of Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah . The Jews envied the Messenger because of the great prophethood that Allah gave him, and as a consequence, they denied the Messenger, defied him, became his enemies and fought against him. Allah sent humiliation upon them in this life, that shall be followed by disgrace in the Hereafter,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÖõÑöÈóÊú Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáĞøöáøóÉõ æóÇáúãóÓúßóäóÉõ æóÈóÂÁõæÇ ÈöÛóÖóÈò ãøöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah.) in this life and the Hereafter. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö æóÑõÓõáöåö æóáóãú íõİóÑøöŞõæÇú Èóíúäó ÃóÍóÏò ãøöäúåõãú</div><br>  (And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them,) This refers to the Ummah of Muhammad who believe in every Book that Allah has revealed and in every Prophet whom Allah has sent. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÁóÇãóäó ÇáÑøóÓõæáõ ÈöãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúåö ãöä ÑøóÈøöåö æóÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó ßõáøñ ÁóÇãóäó ÈöÇááøóåö</div><br>  (The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. All of them believe in Allah.) (2:285). Allah then states that He has prepared great rewards for them, tremendous favor and a handsome bounty,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó Óóæúİó íõÄúÊöíåöãú ÃõÌõæÑóåõãú</div><br>  (We shall give them their rewards;) because of their faith in Allah and His Messengers,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑÇğ ÑøóÍöíãÇğ</div><br>  (and Allah is Ever Forgiving, Most Merciful.) for their sin, if they have any.  </div></body></html>
