In this noble Ayah is an evidence that the Hadith that many of the ignorant people often circulate, which says that the Prophet will not remain under the earth more than one thousand years (i.e., the Hour will be before that period) is a baseless lie. We have not seen it in any of the Books (of Hadith). Verily, the Messenger of Allah was asked about the time of the Hour and he would not respond. When Jibril appeared to him in the form of a bedouin Arab, one of the questions he asked the Prophet was, "O Muhammad! Tell me about the Hour'' So the Prophet replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÇáúãóÓúÄõæáõ ÚóäúåóÇ ÈöÃóÚúáóãó ãöäó ÇáÓøóÇÆöá»</div><br>  (The one questioned about it knows no more than the questioner.) On another occasion when a bedouin Arab called out to the Prophet in a loud voice saying, "O Muhammad! When will be the Hour'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóíúÍóßó ÅöäøóåóÇ ßóÇÆöäóÉñ¡ İóãóÇ ÃóÚúÏóÏúÊó áóåóÇ¿»</div><br>  (Woe unto you. Verily, it will occur so what have you prepared for it) The man replied, "I have not prepared much for it of prayers and fasting, but I love Allah and His Messenger.'' The Prophet then replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÃóäúÊó ãóÚó ãóäú ÃóÍúÈóÈúÊ»</div><br>  (Then you will be with whomever you love.) Anas said, "The Muslims were not happier with anything like they were upon (hearing) this Hadith.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÜáöãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö İóáÇó íõÙúåöÑõ Úóáóì ÛóíúÈöåö ÃóÍóÏÇğ ÅöáÇøó ãóäö ÇÑúÊóÖóì ãöä ÑøóÓõæáò</div><br>  (The All-Knower of the Unseen, and He reveals to none His Unseen. Except to a Messenger) This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõÍöíØõæäó ÈöÔóíúÁò ãøöäú Úöáúãöåö ÅöáÇøó ÈöãóÇ ÔóÂÁó</div><br>  (And they will never compass any thing of His knowledge except that which He wills.) (2:255) Similarly, Allah says here that He knows the unseen and the seen and that no one of His creation can attain any of His knowledge except that which Allah allows him to have. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÜáöãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö İóáÇó íõÙúåöÑõ Úóáóì ÛóíúÈöåö ÃóÍóÏÇğ ÅöáÇøó ãóäö ÇÑúÊóÖóì ãöä ÑøóÓõæáò</div><br>  (The All-Knower of the Unseen, and He reveals to none His Unseen. Except to a Messenger whom He has chosen,) This includes the angelic Messenger and the human Messenger. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóåõ íóÓúáõßõ ãöä Èóíúäö íóÏóíúåö æóãöäú Îóáúİöåö ÑóÕóÏÇğ</div><br>  (and then He makes a band of watching guards to march before him and behind him.) meaning, He particularly gives him additional guardian angels who protect him by the command of Allah and they accompany him with that which is with him of Allah's revelation. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíóÚúáóãó Ãóä ŞóÏú ÃóÈúáóÛõæÇú ÑöÓóÜáóÜÊö ÑóÈøöåöãú æóÃóÍóÇØó ÈöãóÇ áóÏóíúåöãú æóÃóÍúÕóì ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò ÚóÏóÏÇğ </div><br>  (Till he knows that they have conveyed the Messages of their Lord. And He surrounds all that which is with them, and He keeps count of all things.) The pronoun `he' which is in His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíóÚúáóãó</div><br>  (Till he knows) refers to the Prophet . Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÜáöãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö İóáÇó íõÙúåöÑõ Úóáóì ÛóíúÈöåö ÃóÍóÏÇğ - ÅöáÇøó ãóäö ÇÑúÊóÖóì ãöä ÑøóÓõæáò İóÅöäøóåõ íóÓúáõßõ ãöä Èóíúäö íóÏóíúåö æóãöäú Îóáúİöåö ÑóÕóÏÇğ </div><br>  (The All-Knower of the Unseen, and He reveals to none His Unseen. Except to a Messenger whom He has chosen, and then He makes a band of watching guards to march before him and behind him.) "These are four guardians among the angels along with Jibril,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíóÚúáóãó</div><br>  (Till he knows) This means Muhammad ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä ŞóÏú ÃóÈúáóÛõæÇú ÑöÓóÜáóÜÊö ÑóÈøöåöãú æóÃóÍóÇØó ÈöãóÇ áóÏóíúåöãú æóÃóÍúÕóì ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò ÚóÏóÏÇğ</div><br>  (that they have conveyed the Messages of their Lord. And He surrounds all that which is with them, and He keeps count of all things.)'' This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. It has also been reported by Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Yazid bin Abi Habib. `Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ma`mar, from Qatadah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíóÚúáóãó Ãóä ŞóÏú ÃóÈúáóÛõæÇú ÑöÓóÜáóÜÊö ÑóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  (Till he knows that they have conveyed the Messages of their Lord.) "So that the Prophet of Allah would know that the Messengers had conveyed their Messages from Allah and that the angels have protected them and defended them.'' This has also been reported by Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah from Qatadah, and Ibn Jarir preferred this interpretation. Al-Baghawi said, "Ya`qub recited it as, (áöíõÚúáóãó) (in order to be known) this means, so that the people may know that the Messengers had conveyed the Message.'' It also could carry the meaning that the pronoun refers to Allah (i.e., So that He (Allah) may know). This opinion has been mentioned by Ibn Al-Jawzi in Zad Al-Masir. The meaning of this is that He protects His Messengers through His angels so that they will be able to convey His Messages. He protects what He reveals to them of revelation so that He will know that they have indeed conveyed the Messages of their Lord. This is like His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ ÇáúŞöÈúáóÉó ÇáøóÊöì ßõäÊó ÚóáóíúåóÂ ÅöáÇøó áöäóÚúáóãó ãóä íóÊøóÈöÚõ ÇáÑøóÓõæáó ãöãøóä íóäŞóáöÈõ Úóáóì ÚóŞöÈóíúåö</div><br>  (And We made the Qiblah which you used to face, only that We know who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels.) (2:143) Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóíóÚúáóãóäøó Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóáóíóÚúáóãóäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó </div><br>  (Verily, Allah knows those who believe, and that He knows the hypocrites.) (29:11) It should be added to these examples that from Allah's knowledge is that He knows all things before they occur, and this is something definite and certain. Therefore, He says after this,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÍóÇØó ÈöãóÇ áóÏóíúåöãú æóÃóÍúÕóì ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò ÚóÏóÏÇğ</div><br>  (And He surrounds all that which is with them, and He keeps count of all things.)  This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Jinn, and all praises and thanks are due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
