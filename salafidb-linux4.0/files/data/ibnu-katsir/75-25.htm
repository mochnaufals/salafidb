For verily, he (the Prophet ) was rushing in his attempts to grasp the revelation and he would be reciting the revelation with the angel while he was reciting it. Therefore, Allah commanded him that when the angel brings some revelation to him he should just listen. Allah would make sure to collect it in his chest, and He would make it easy for him to recite it in the same way that it was revealed to him. Allah would explain it, interpret it and clarify it for him. So the first phase was gathering it in his chest, the second phase was recitation and the third phase was its explanation and clarification of its meaning. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊõÍóÑøößú Èöåö áöÓóÇäóßó áöÊóÚúÌóáó Èöåö </div><br>  (Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith.) meaning, with the Qur'an.

Increase me in knowledge.'') (20:114) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÌóãúÚóåõ</div><br>  (It is for Us to collect it) meaning, `in your chest.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõÑúÁóÇäóåõ</div><br>  (and that it be recited.) meaning, `that you recite it.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ŞóÑóÃúäóÜåõ</div><br>  (And when We have recited it to you,) meaning, `when the angel has recited it to you from Allah,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÊøóÈöÚú ŞõÑúÁóÇäóåõ</div><br>  (then follow its recitation.) meaning, `listen to it then recite it as he taught you to recite it.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó Åöäøó ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÈóíóÇäóåõ </div><br>  (Then it is for Us to make it clear.) meaning, `after memorizing it and reciting it, We will explain it to you, clarify it and inspire you with its meaning according to what We intended and legislated.' Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said that the Messenger of Allah used to struggle very hard to grasp the revelation and he used to move his lips (rapidly with the recitation). The narrator, Sa`id, then said, "Ibn `Abbas said to me, `I will move my lips like the Messenger of Allah used to move his lips (in order to show you).''' Then, the subnarrator said, "And Sa`id said to me, `I will move my lips like I saw Ibn `Abbas moving his lips (in order to show you).'''

So after this, when Jibril would leave, he would recite it as Jibril had taught him to recite it.''  This has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Al-Bukhari's wording says, "So whenever Jibril would come to him he would be silent, and when Jibril had left he would recite it just as Allah, the Mighty and Sublime had promised him.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Cause of rejecting the Day of Judgement is Love of the World and Heedlessness of the Hereafter</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó Èóáú ÊõÍöÈøõæäó ÇáúÚóÇÌöáóÉó - æóÊóĞóÑõæäó ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉó </div><br>  (But no!

The believers seeing Allah in the abode of the Hereafter has been confirmed in the authentic Hadiths from numerous routes of transmission with the scholars of Hadith. It is not possible to deny this or refuse it. Examples would be the Hadiths of Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurayrah, and they are both recorded in the Two Sahihs. They both mentioned that some people said, "O Messenger of Allah! Will we see our Lord on the Day of Judgement'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóáú ÊõÖóÇÑøõæäó İöí ÑõÄúíóÉö ÇáÔøóãúÓö æóÇáúŞóãóÑö áóíúÓó ÏõæäóåõãóÇ ÓóÍóÇÈñ¿»</div><br>  (Are you harmed by seeing the sun and the moon when there are no clouds beneath them) They replied, "No.'' The Prophet then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöäøóßõãú ÊóÑóæúäó ÑóÈøóßõãú ßóĞóáöß»</div><br>  (Then you will surely see your Lord like that.) In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from Jabir that he said, "The Messenger of Allah looked at the moon on a night when it was full, and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóßõãú ÊóÑóæúäó ÑóÈøóßõãú ßóãóÇ ÊóÑóæúäó åóĞóÇ ÇáúŞóãóÑó¡ İóÅöäö ÇÓúÊóØóÚúÊõãú Ãóäú áóÇ ÊõÛúáóÈõæÇ Úóáóì ÕóáóÇÉò ŞóÈúáó ØõáõæÚö ÇáÔøóãúÓö æóáóÇ ŞóÈúáó ÛõÑõæÈöåóÇ¡ İóÇİúÚóáõæÇ»</div><br>  (Verily, you will see your Lord just as you see this moon! So if you are able to avoid missing a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr prayer) or before its setting (`Asr prayer) then do so.)'' Among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is a narration from Suhayb that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÏóÎóáó Ãóåúáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ŞóÇáó íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáì: ÊõÑöíÏõæäó ÔóíúÆğÇ ÃóÒöíÏõßõãú¿ İóíóŞõæáõæäó: Ãóáóãú ÊõÈóíøöÖú æõÌõæåóäóÇ¿ Ãóáóãú ÊõÏúÎöáúäóÇ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó æóÊõäóÌøöäóÇ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö¿ ŞóÇáó: İóíóßúÔöİõ ÇáúÍöÌóÇÈó¡ İóãóÇ ÃõÚúØõæÇ ÔóíúÆğÇ ÃóÍóÈøó Åöáóíúåöãú ãöäó ÇáäøóÙóÑö Åöáóì ÑóÈøöåöãú¡ æóåöíó ÇáÒøöíóÇÏóÉ»</div><br>  (When the people of Paradise enter the Paradise, Allah will say, `Do you want me to give you anything extra' They will say, `Haven't you whitened our faces Haven't you entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire' Then He will remove the veil and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, and that will be the extra (Ziyadah).) Then he recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöáøóĞöíäó ÃóÍúÓóäõæÇú ÇáúÍõÓúäóì æóÒöíóÇÏóÉñ</div><br>  (For those who have done good is the best and extra (Ziyadah).) (10:26) Also among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is the Hadith of Jabir in which the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó íóÊóÌóáøóì áöáúãõÄúãöäöíäó íóÖúÍóß»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah will appear before the believers while He is laughing.) This will take place on the open plains of the Resurrection place. In some of these Hadiths, it mentions that the believers will be looking at their Lord on the open plains and some mention that this will occur in the Gardens of Paradise. If it were not due to fear of taking up a lot of space, we would present all of these Hadiths with their routes of transmission and wordings from those that are in the Sahih collections, the collections of good narrations, the Musnad collections and the Sunan collections. However, we have mentioned this in separate places in this Tafsir, and Allah is the Giver of success. This issue is something that the Companions, the Successors and the Salaf of this nation have agreed upon, and all praise is due to Allah. It is something that is agreed upon between the Imams of Islam and the guides of all mankind. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Blackening of the Faces of the Disobedient People on the Day of Judgement</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæõÌõæåñ íóæúãóÆöĞò ÈóÇÓöÑóÉñ - ÊóÙõäøõ Ãóä íõİúÚóáó ÈöåóÇ İóÇŞöÑóÉñ </div><br>  (And some faces that Day will be Basirah.

Mujahid said, "A disaster.'' Qatadah said, "An evil.'' As-Suddi said, "They will be certain that they are going to be destroyed.'' Ibn Zayd said, "They will think that they are going to enter into the Hellfire.''
