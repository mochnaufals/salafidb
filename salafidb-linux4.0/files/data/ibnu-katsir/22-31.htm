This was the view of Ibn Jarir, who recorded it from Qatadah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to shun Shirk and Lying</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáÑøöÌúÓó ãöäó ÇáÇøñæúËóÜäö æóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú Şóæúáó ÇáÒøõæÑö</div><br>  (So shun the Rijis of the idols, and shun false speech.) From this it is clear what Ar-Rijs means, i.e., avoid the abomination, which means idols. Shirk is mentioned in conjunction with false speech, as in the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÅöäøóãóÇ ÍóÑøóãó ÑóÈøöíó ÇáúİóæóÍöÔó ãóÇ ÙóåóÑó ãöäúåóÇ æóãóÇ ÈóØóäó æóÇáÅöËúãó æóÇáúÈóÛúìó ÈöÛóíúÑö ÇáúÍóŞøö æóÃóä ÊõÔúÑößõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö ãóÇ áóãú íõäóÒøöáú Èöåö ÓõáúØóÜäÇğ æóÃóä ÊóŞõæáõæÇú Úóáóì Çááøóåö ãóÇ áÇó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Say: "(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge''.) 7:33 This includes bearing false witness. In the Two Sahihs it was reported from Abu Bakrah that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ÃõäóÈøöÜÜÆõßõãú ÈöÃóßúÈóÑö ÇáúßóÈóÇÆöÑö¿»</div><br>  (Shall I not tell you about the worst of major sins) We said, "Yes, O Messenger of Allah.'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÅöÔúÑóÇßõ ÈöÇááåö æóÚõŞõæŞõ ÇáúæóÇáöÏóíúäö (Associating others with Allah, disobeying one's parents.)

Imam Ahmad recorded that Khuraym bin Fatik Al-Asadi said, "The Messenger of Allah prayed As-Subh (Al-Fajr), and when he had finished, he stood up and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÚóÏóáóÊú ÔóåóÇÏóÉõ ÇáÒøõæÑö ÇáúÅöÔúÑóÇßó ÈöÇááåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóá»</div><br>  (Bearing false witness is on a par with the association of others with Allah.) Then he recited this Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáÑøöÌúÓó ãöäó ÇáÇøñæúËóÜäö æóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú Şóæúáó ÇáÒøõæÑöÍõäóİóÂÁó ááøóåö ÛóíúÑó ãõÔúÑößöíäó Èöåö</div><br>  (So shun the Rijs of the idols, and shun lying speech. Hunafa' Lillah, not associating partners unto Him;)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍõäóİóÂÁó ááøóåö</div><br>  (Hunafa' Lillah) means, sincerely submitting to Him Alone, shunning falsehood and seeking the truth. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÛóíúÑó ãõÔúÑößöíäó Èöåö</div><br>  (not associating partners unto Him;) Then Allah gives a likeness of the idolator in his misguidance and being doomed and being far away from true guidance, and says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõÔúÑößú ÈöÇááøóåö İóßóÃóäøóãóÇ ÎóÑøó ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö</div><br>  (and whoever assigns partners to Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky,) meaning,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóÎúØóİõåõ ÇáØøóíúÑõ</div><br>  (the birds caught him in midair,)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú Êóåúæöì Èöåö ÇáÑøöíÍõ İöì ãóßóÇäò ÓóÍöíŞò</div><br>  (or the wind had thrown him to a far off place.) means, remote and desolate, dangerous for anyone who lands there. Hence it says in the Hadith of Al-Bara':   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáúßóÇİöÑó ÅöĞóÇ ÊóæóİøóÊúåõ ãóáóÇÆößóÉõ ÇáúãóæúÊö æóÕóÚöÏõæÇ ÈöÑõæÍöåö Åöáóì ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö¡ İóáóÇ ÊõİúÊóÍõ áóåõ ÃóÈúæóÇÈõ ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö Èóáú ÊõØúÑóÍõ ÑõæÍõåõ ØóÑúÍğÇ ãöäú åõäóÇß»</div><br>  (When the angels of death take the soul of the disbeliever in death, they take his soul up to the heaven, but the gates of heaven are not opened for him; on the contrary, his soul is thrown down from there.) Then he recited this Ayah. The Hadith has already been quoted in our explanation of Surah Ibrahim. Allah gives another parable of the idolators in Surat Al-An`am, where He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóäóÏúÚõæÇú ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ãóÇ áÇó íóäİóÚõäóÇ æóáÇó íóÖõÑøõäóÇ æóäõÑóÏøõ Úóáóì ÃóÚúŞóÜÈöäóÇ ÈóÚúÏó ÅöĞú åóÏóÇäóÇ Çááøóåõ ßóÇáøóĞöì ÇÓúÊóåúæóÊúåõ ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäõ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÍóíúÑóÇäó áóåõ ÃóÕúÍóÜÈñ íóÏúÚõæäóåõ Åöáóì ÇáúåõÏóì ÇÆúÊöäóÇ Şõáú Åöäøó åõÏóì Çááøóåö åõæó ÇáúåõÏóì</div><br>  (Say: "Shall we invoke others besides Allah, that can do us neither good nor can harm us, and shall we turn back on our heels after Allah has guided us -- like one whom the Shayaátin have made to go astray in the land in confusion, his companions calling him to guidance (saying): `Come to us.''' Say: "Verily, Allah's guidance is the only guidance.'') 6:71  </div></body></html>
