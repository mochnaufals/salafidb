Similarly, Allah mentioned their claims in Surat Al-Ma'idah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÍúäõ ÃóÈúäóÇÁõ Çááøóåö æóÃóÍöÈøóÇÄõåõ</div><br>  (We are the children of Allah and His loved ones) (5:18).  Allah refuted this false claim and informed them that they will be punished because of their sins. Previously we mentioned their claim that the Fire would not touch them for more than a few days, after which they would be put in Paradise. Allah rebuked this claim, and He said about this baseless claim, m   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÃóãóÇäöíøõåõãú</div><br>  (These are their own desires). Abu Al-`Aliyah commented, "These are wishes that they wished Allah would answer, without basis.'' Similar was stated by Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú</div><br>  (Say) meaning, "Say O Muhammad:''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÇÊõæÇú ÈõÑúåóÜäóßõãú</div><br>  ("Produce your Burhan...'') meaning, "Your proof'', as Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas stated. Qatadah said that the Ayah means, "Bring the evidence that supports your statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó</div><br>  (if you are truthful) in your claim. ''  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáóì ãóäú ÃóÓúáóãó æóÌúåóåõ áöáøóåö æóåõæó ãõÍúÓöäñ</div><br>  (Yes! But whoever submits his face (himself) to Allah (i.e. follows Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism) and he is a Muhsin) meaning, "Whoever performs deeds in sincerity, for Allah alone without partners.'' In a similar statement, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅäú ÍóÂÌøõæßó İóŞõáú ÃóÓúáóãúÊõ æóÌúåöìó ááøóåö æóãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚóäö</div><br>  (So if they dispute with you (Muhammad ) say: "I have submitted myself to Allah (in Islam), and (so have) those who follow me.'') (3:20)  Abu Al-`Aliyah and Ar-Rabi` said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáóì ãóäú ÃóÓúáóãó æóÌúåóåõ áöáøóåö</div><br>  (Yes! But whoever submits his face (himself) to Allah) means, "Whoever is sincere with Allah.''  Also, Sa`id bin Jubayr said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáóì ãóäú ÃóÓúáóãó</div><br>  (Yes! But whoever submits) means, he is sincere,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌúåóåõ</div><br>  (his face (himself)) meaning, in his religion.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ãõÍúÓöäñ</div><br>  (and he is a Muhsin) following the Messenger . For there are two conditions for deeds to be accepted; the deed must be performed for Allah's sake alone and conform to the Shari`ah. When the deed is sincere, but does not conform to the Shari`ah, then it will not be accepted. The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Úóãöáó ÚóãóáğÇ áóíúÓó Úóáóíúåö ÃóãúÑõäóÇ İóåõæó ÑóÏ»</div><br>  (Whoever performs a deed that does not conform with our matter (religion), then it will be rejected.)  This Hadith was recorded by Muslim. Therefore, the good deeds of the priests and rabbis will not be accepted, even if they are sincerely for Allah alone, because these deeds do not conform with the method of the Messenger , who was sent for all mankind. Allah said regarding such cases,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÏöãúäóÂ Åöáóì ãóÇ ÚóãöáõæÇú ãöäú Úóãóáò İóÌóÚóáúäóÇåõ åóÈóÂÁğ ãøóäËõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.) (25:23)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÃóÚúãóÜáõåõãú ßóÓóÑóÇÈò ÈöŞöíÚóÉò íóÍúÓóÈõåõ ÇáÙøóãúÂäõ ãóÂÁğ ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõ áóãú íóÌöÏúåõ ÔóíúÆÇğ</div><br>  (As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing.) (24:39) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æõÌõæåñ íóæúãóÆöĞò ÎóÜÔöÚóÉñ - ÚóÇãöáóÉñ äøóÇÕöÈóÉñ - ÊóÕúáóì äóÇÑÇğ ÍóÇãöíóÉğ - ÊõÓúŞóì ãöäú Úóíúäò ÁóÇäöíóÉò </div><br>  (Some faces, that Day will be humiliated. Laboring, weary. They will enter in the hot blazing Fire. They will be given to drink from a boiling spring) (88:2-5).  When the deed conforms to the Shari`ah outwardly, but the person did not perform it sincerely for Allah alone, the deed will also be rejected, as in the case of the hypocrites and those who do their deeds to show off. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó íõÎóÜÏöÚõæäó Çááøóåó æóåõæó ÎóÇÏöÚõåõãú æóÅöĞóÇ ŞóÇãõæÇú Åöáóì ÇáÕøóáóæÉö ŞóÇãõæÇú ßõÓóÇáóì íõÑóÂÁõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓó æóáÇó íóĞúßõÑõæäó Çááøóåó ÅöáÇøó ŞóáöíáÇğ </div><br>  (Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for As-Salah (the prayer), they stand with laziness to be seen by people, and they do not remember Allah but little.) (4:142) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóæóíúáñ áøöáúãõÕóáøöíäó - ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú Úóä ÕóáóÜÊöåöãú ÓóÇåõæäó - ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú íõÑóÂÁõæäó - æóíóãúäóÚõæäó ÇáúãóÇÚõæäó </div><br>  (So woe unto those performers of Salah (prayers) (hypocrites). Those who delay their Salah (from their stated fixed times). Those who do good deeds only to be seen (of men). And withhold Al-Ma`un (small kindnesses)) (107:4-7).  This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä ßóÇäó íóÑúÌõæ áöŞóÂÁó ÑóÈøöåö İóáúíóÚúãóáú ÚóãóáÇğ ÕóÜáöÍÇğ æóáÇó íõÔúÑößú ÈöÚöÈóÇÏóÉö ÑóÈøöåö ÃóÍóÏóÇ</div><br>  (So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord) (18: 110).  He also said in this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáóì ãóäú ÃóÓúáóãó æóÌúåóåõ áöáøóåö æóåõæó ãõÍúÓöäñ</div><br>  (Yes, but whoever submits his face (himself) to Allah (follows Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism) and he is a Muhsin).  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóåõãú ÃóÌúÑõåõãú ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú æóáÇó Îóæúİñ Úóáóíúåöãú æóáÇó åõãú íóÍúÒóäõæäó</div><br>  (Shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve) guaranteed them the rewards and safety from what they fear and should avoid.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó Îóæúİñ Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (There shall be no fear on them) in the future,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó åõãú íóÍúÒóäõæäó</div><br>  (nor shall they grieve) about what they abandoned in the past. Moreover, Sa`id bin Jubayr said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó Îóæúİñ Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  "(There shall be no fear on them) in the Hereafter, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó åõãú íóÍúÒóäõæäó</div><br>  (nor shall they grieve) about their imminent death.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Jews and Christians dispute among Themselves out of Disbelief and Stubbornness</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáóÊö ÇáúíóåõæÏõ áóíúÓóÊö ÇáäøóÕóÜÑóì Úóáóì ÔóìúÁò æóŞóÇáóÊö ÇáäøóÕóÜÑóì áóíúÓóÊö ÇáúíóåõæÏõ Úóáóì ÔóìúÁò æóåõãú íóÊúáõæäó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); though they both recite the Scripture.)  Allah explained the disputes, hatred and stubbornness that the People of the Book have towards each other. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "When a delegation of Christians from Najran came to the Messenger of Allah , the Jewish rabbis came and began arguing with them before the Messenger of Allah . Rafi` bin Huraymilah said, `You do not follow anything,' and he reiterated his disbelief in Jesus and the Injil. Then a Christian man from Najran's delegation said to the Jews, `Rather, you do not follow anything,' and he reiterated his rejection of Musa's prophethood and his disbelief in the Torah. So Allah revealed the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáóÊö ÇáúíóåõæÏõ áóíúÓóÊö ÇáäøóÕóÜÑóì Úóáóì ÔóìúÁò æóŞóÇáóÊö ÇáäøóÕóÜÑóì áóíúÓóÊö ÇáúíóåõæÏõ Úóáóì ÔóìúÁò æóåõãú íóÊúáõæäó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); though they both recite the Scripture. )''  Allah made it clear that each party read the affirmation of what they claimed to reject in their Book. Consequently, the Jews disbelieve in Jesus, even though they have the Torah in which Allah took their Covenant by the tongue of Moses to believe in Jesus. Also, the Gospel contains Jesus' assertion that Moses' prophethood and the Torah came from Allah. Yet, each party disbelieved in what the other party had.  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó ŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó ãöËúáó Şóæúáöåöãú</div><br>  (Like unto their word, said those who know not) thus exposing the ignorance displayed by the Jews and the Christians concerning their statements that we mentioned. There is a difference of opinion regarding the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (who know not)  For instance, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Qatadah said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó ŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (Like unto their word, said those said those who know not) means, "The Christians said similar statements to the Jews.'' Ibn Jurayj asked `Ata' "Who are those `who know not''' `Ata' said, "Nations that existed before the Jews and the Christians and before the Torah and the Gospel.'' Also, As-Suddi said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (said those who know not) is in reference to the Arabs who said that Muhammad was not following anything (i. e. did not follow a true or existing religion). Abu Ja`far bin Jarir chose the view that this Ayah is general and that there is no evidence that specifically supports any of these explanations. So interpreting the Ayah in a general way is better. Allah knows best.  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇááøóåõ íóÍúßõãõ Èóíúäóåõãú íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö İöíãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú İöíåö íóÎúÊóáöİõæäó</div><br>  (Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they have been differing.) meaning, that Allah will gather them all on the Day of Return. On that Day, Allah will justly judge between them, for He is never unjust with anyone, even as little as the weight of an atom. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement in Surat Al-Hajj (22:17),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú æóÇáÕøóÜÈöÆöíäó æóÇáäøóÕóÜÑóì æóÇáúãóÌõæÓó æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÔúÑóßõæÇú Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóİúÕöáõ Èóíúäóåõãú íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíÜãóÉö Åöäøó Çááøóåó Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ÔóåöíÏñ </div><br>  (Verily, those who believe (in Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad ), and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Majus, and those who associate partners with Allah; truly, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, Allah is over all things a Witness).  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íóÌúãóÚõ ÈóíúäóäóÇ ÑóÈøõäóÇ Ëõãøó íóİúÊóÍõ ÈóíúäóäóÇ ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö æóåõæó ÇáúİóÊøóÇÍõ ÇáúÚóáöíãõ </div><br>  (Say: "Our Lord will assemble us all together (on the Day of Resurrection), then He will judge between us with truth.
