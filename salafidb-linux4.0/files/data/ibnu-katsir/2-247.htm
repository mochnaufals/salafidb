And their Prophet said to them, "Indeed Allah has appointed Talut (Saul) as a king over you.'' They said, "How can he be a king over us when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth.'' He said: "Verily, Allah has chosen him above you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower.'')</div>  When the Israelites asked their Prophet to appoint a king over them, he appointed Talut (Saul), who was then a soldier. But, Talut was not a descendant of the house of kings among them, which was exclusively in the offspring of Yahudha (Judah). This is why they said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøóì íóßõæäõ áóåõ Çáúãõáúßõ ÚóáóíúäóÇ</div><br>  (How can he be a king over us) meaning, how can he be the king for us,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÍúäõ ÃóÍóŞøõ ÈöÇáúãõáúßö ãöäúåõ æóáóãú íõÄúÊó ÓóÚóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáúãóÇáö</div><br>  (when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth) They said that Talut was also poor and did not have the wealth that justifies him being king. Some people stated that Talut used to bring water to the people, while others stated that his profession was dyeing skins. The Jews, thus, disputed with their Prophet while they were supposed to obey him and to say good words to him.  Their Prophet answered them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÇÕúØóİóÜåõ Úóáóíúßõãú</div><br>  (Verily, Allah has chosen him above you) meaning, `Allah chose Talut from amongst you while having better knowledge about him.' Their Prophet stated, "I did not choose Talut to be your king on my own. Rather, Allah has commanded that upon your request.'' Further:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÒóÇÏóåõ ÈóÓúØóÉğ İöí ÇáúÚöáúãö æóÇáúÌöÓúãö</div><br>  (...and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature.) meaning, `Talut is more knowledgeable and honorable than you, and stronger and more patient during combat, and has more knowledge of warfare. In short, he has more knowledge and is stronger than you are. The king should have sufficient knowledge, be fair looking and should have a strong soul and body.' He then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íõÄúÊöì ãõáúßóåõ ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills.) meaning, Allah Alone is the Supreme Authority Who does what He wills and no one can ask Him about His actions, while they will be asked (about their actions by Him). This is because Allah has perfect knowledge, wisdom and kindness with His creation. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ æóÓöÚñ Úóáöíãñ</div><br>  (And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower.) meaning, His favor is encompassing and He grants His mercy to whom He wills. He also knows those who deserve to be kings and those who do not deserve it.  </div></body></html>
