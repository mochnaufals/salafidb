This is the issue of disbelief and faith; they never confront one another but faith always prevails:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú äóŞúĞöİõ ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö Úóáóì ÇáúÈóÜØöáö İóíóÏúãóÛõåõ İóÅöĞóÇ åõæó ÒóÇåöŞñ æóáóßõãõ Çáúæóíúáõ ãöãøóÇ ÊóÕöİõæäó </div><br>  (Nay, We fling the truth against the falsehood, so it destroys it, and behold, it disappears.

(17:81) The sorcerers of Egypt were the most skilled in the art of illusion, but when a huge group of them gathered from all corners of the land, and the people came together on that day whose exact numbers are known to Allah Alone, one of them said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóäóÇ äóÊøóÈöÚõ ÇáÓøóÍóÑóÉó Åöä ßóÇäõæÇú åõãõ ÇáúÛóÜáöÈöíäó </div><br>  (That we may follow the sorcerers if they are the winners.) They did not say: `we will follow the truth, whether it rests with the sorcerers or with Musa;' the people were followers of the religion of their king.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁó ÇáÓøóÍóÑóÉõ</div><br>  (So, when the sorcerers arrived,) means, when they reached the court of Fir`awn, and a pavilion had been erected for him. There he gathered his servants, followers, administrators, and provincial leaders, and the soldiers of his kingdom. The sorcerers stood before Fir`awn, asking him to treat them well and bring them closer to him if they prevailed in this matter which he had brought them together for. They said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁó ÇáÓøóÍóÑóÉõ ŞóÇáõæÇú áöİöÑúÚóæúäó ÃóÅöäøó áóäóÇ áÇøÌúÑÇğ Åöä ßõäøóÇ äóÍúäõ ÇáúÛóÜáöÈöíäó - ŞóÇáó äóÚóãú æóÅöäøóßõãú ÅöĞÇğ áøóãöäó ÇáúãõŞóÑøóÈöíäó </div><br>  ("Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners'' He said: "Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near.'') meaning, `and you will be given more than what you are asking for; I will make you among those who are close to me, those who sit with me.' So they went back to their places:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú íãõæÓóì ÅöãøóÂ Ãóä ÊõáúŞöìó æóÅöãøóÂ Ãóä äøóßõæäó Ãóæøóáó ãóäú ÃóáúŞóì ŞóÇáó Èóáú ÃóáúŞõæÇú</div><br>  (They said: "O Musa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw'' (Musa) said: "Nay, throw you (first)!'') (20:65-66). Here the incident is described more briefly. Musa said to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáúŞõæÇú ãóÂ ÃóäÊõãú ãøõáúŞõæäóİóÃóáúŞóæúÇú ÍöÈóÜáóåõãú æóÚöÕöíøóåõãú æóŞóÇáõæÇú ÈöÚöÒøóÉö İöÑúÚóæäó ÅöäøóÇ áóäóÍúäõ ÇáúÛóÜáöÈõæäó </div><br>  ("Throw what you are going to throw!'' So, they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said: "By the might of Fir`awn, it is we who will certainly win!'') This is what the ignorant masses say when they do something: `this is by the virtue of So-and-so!' In Surat Al-A`raf Allah mentioned that they:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÍóÑõæÇú ÃóÚúíõäó ÇáäøóÇÓö æóÇÓúÊóÑúåóÈõæåõãú æóÌóÂÁõæ ÈöÓöÍúÑò ÚóÙöíãò</div><br>  (They bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic) (7:116). And in Surah Ta Ha He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ÍöÈóÇáõåõãú æóÚöÕöíøõåõãú íõÎóíøóáõ Åöáóíúåö ãöä ÓöÍúÑöåöãú ÃóäøóåóÇ ÊóÓúÚóì</div><br>  (Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.) until Allah saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõİúáöÍõ ÇáÓøóÜÍöÑõ ÍóíúËõ ÃóÊóì</div><br>  (and the magician will never be successful, whatever the amount (of skill) he may attain) (20:69). And here Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóáúŞóì ãõæÓóì ÚóÕóÜåõ İóÅöĞóÇ åöìó ÊóáúŞóİõ ãóÇ íóÃúİößõæäó </div><br>  (Then Musa threw his stick, and behold, it swallowed up all that they falsely showed!) by snatching up and catching them from every corner and swallowing them up, and it did not leave any of them untouched. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóæóŞóÚó ÇáúÍóŞøõ æóÈóØóáó ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.) until   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö ãõæÓóì æóåóÜÑõæäó </div><br>  (The Lord of Musa and Harun.) (7:118-122) This was a very serious matter, furnishing decisive proof leaving no room for any excuse. Fir`awn's supporters, who sought and hoped that they would prevail over Musa, were themselves defeated. At that moment they believed in Musa and prostrated to Allah, the Lord of Al-`Alamin Who sent Musa and Harun with the truth and an obvious miracle. Fir`awn was defeated in a manner the likes of which the world had never seen, but he remained arrogant and stubborn despite the clear evidence, may the curse of Allah and the angels and all of mankind be upon him. He resorted to arrogance and stubbornness and propagating falsehood. He began to issue threats against them, saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ áóßóÈöíÑõßõãõ ÇáøóĞöì Úóáøóãóßõãõ ÇáÓøöÍúÑó</div><br>  (Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic) (20:71).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóÜĞóÇ áóãóßúÑñ ãøóßóÑúÊõãõæåõ İöì ÇáúãóÏöíäóÉö</div><br>  (Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city) (7:123).  </div></body></html>
