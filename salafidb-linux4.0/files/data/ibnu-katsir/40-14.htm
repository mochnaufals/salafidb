So, call you upon Allah making religion sincerely for Him, however much the disbelievers may hate.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Regret of the Disbelievers after They enter Hell</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah tells us that the disbelievers will feel regret on the Day of Resurrection, when they enter Hell and sink in the agonizing depth of fire. When they actually experience the unbearable punishment of Allah, they will hate themselves with the utmost hatred, because of the sins they committed in the past, which were the cause of their entering the Fire. At that point the angels will tell them in a loud voice that Allah's hatred towards them in this world, when Faith was offered to them and they rejected it, is greater than their hatred towards themselves in this situation. Qatadah said, concerning the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóãóŞúÊõ Çááøóåö ÃóßúÈóÑõ ãöä ãøóŞúÊößõãú ÃóäİõÓóßõÜãú ÅöĞú ÊõÏúÚóæúäó Åöáóì ÇáÅöíãóÜäö İóÊóßúİõÑõæäó</div><br>  (Indeed, Allah's aversion was greater towards you than your aversion toward yourselves, when you were called to the Faith but you used to refuse.) "Allah's hatred for the people of misguidance -- when Faith is presented to them in this world, and they turn away from it and refuse to accept it -- is greater than their hatred for themselves when they see the punishment of Allah with their own eyes on the Day of Resurrection.'' This was also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Mujahid, As-Suddi, Dharr bin `Ubaydullah Al-Hamdani, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari, may Allah have mercy on them all.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóãóÊøóäóÇ ÇËúäóÊóíúäö æóÃóÍúíóíúÊóäóÇ ÇËúäóÊóíúäö</div><br>  (They will say: "Our Lord! You have made us to die twice, and You have given us life twice!...'') Ath-Thawri narrated from Abu Ishaq from Abu Al-Ahwas from Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him: "This Ayah is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóíúİó ÊóßúİõÑõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóßõäÊõãú ÃóãúæóÊğÇ İóÃóÍúíóÜßõãú Ëõãøó íõãöíÊõßõãú Ëõãøó íõÍúíöíßõãú Ëõãøó Åöáóíúåö ÊõÑúÌóÚõæäó </div><br>  (How can you disbelieve in Allah Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life and then unto Him you will return.)''(2:28) This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and Abu Malik. This is undoubtedly the correct view. What is meant by all of this is that when they are standing before Allah in the arena of Resurrection, the disbelievers will ask to go back, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÊóÑóì ÅöĞö ÇáúãõÌúÑöãõæäó äóÇßöÓõæÇú ÑõÁõæÓöåöãú ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÈúÕóÑúäóÇ æóÓóãöÚúäóÇ İóÇÑúÌöÚúäóÇ äóÚúãóáú ÕóÜáöÍÇğ ÅöäøóÇ ãõæŞöäõæäó </div><br>  (And if you only could see when the criminals shall hang their heads before their Lord (saying): "Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back, that we will do righteous good deeds. Verily, we now believe with certainty.'') (32:12), However, they will get no response. Then when they see the Fire and they are held over it and they look at the punishments therein, they will ask even more fervently than before to go back, but they will get no response. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÊóÑóì ÅöĞú æõŞöİõæÇú Úóáóì ÇáäøóÇÑö İóŞóÇáõæÇú íáóíúÊóäóÇ äõÑóÏøõ æóáÇó äõßóĞøöÈó ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊö ÑóÈøöäóÇ æóäóßõæäó ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó - Èóáú ÈóÏóÇ áóåõãú ãøóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íõÎúİõæäó ãöä ŞóÈúáõ æóáóæú ÑõÏøõæÇú áóÚóÜÏõæÇú áöãóÇ äõåõæÇú Úóäúåõ æóÅöäøóåõãú áóßóÜĞöÈõæäó </div><br>  (If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: "Would that we were but sent back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!'' Nay, it has become manifest to them what they had been concealing before. But if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.) (6:27-28). When they actually enter Hell and have a taste of its heat, hooked rods of iron and chains, their plea to go back will be at its most desperate and fervent:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú íóÕúØóÑöÎõæäó İöíåóÇ ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÎúÑöÌúäóÇ äóÚúãóáú ÕóÜáöÍÇğ ÛóíúÑó ÇáøóĞöì ßõÜäøóÇ äóÚúãóáõ Ãóæóáóãú äõÚóãøöÑúßõãú ãøóÇ íóÊóĞóßøóÑõ İöíåö ãóä ÊóĞóßøóÑó æóÌóÂÁóßõãõ ÇáäøóĞöíÑõ İóĞõæŞõæÇú İóãóÇ áöáÙøóÜáöãöíäó ãöä äøóÕöíÑò </div><br>  (Therein they will cry: "Our Lord! Bring us out, we shall do righteous good deeds, not that we used do.'' (Allah will reply): "Did We not give you lives long enough, so that whosoever would receive admonition could receive it And the warner came to you. So taste you. For the wrongdoers there is no helper.'') (35:37)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÎúÑöÌúäóÇ ãöäúåóÇ İóÅöäú ÚõÏúäóÇ İóÅöäøóÇ ÙóÜáöãõæäó - ŞóÇáó ÇÎúÓóÆõæÇú İöíåóÇ æóáÇó Êõßóáøöãõæäö </div><br>  (Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers.'' He (Allah) will say: "Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!) (23:108). According to this Ayah, they will speak more eloquently, and they will introduce their plea with the words:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóãóÊøóäóÇ ÇËúäóÊóíúäö æóÃóÍúíóíúÊóäóÇ ÇËúäóÊóíúäö</div><br>  (Our Lord! You have made us to die twice, and You have given us life twice!) meaning, `by Your almighty power, You have brought us to life after we were dead, then You caused us to die after we were alive; You are able to do whatever You will. We confess our sins and admit that we wronged ourselves in the world,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóáú Åöáóì ÎõÑõæÌò ãøöä ÓóÈöíáò</div><br>  (then is there any way to get out) means, `will You answer our prayer to send us back to the world, for You are able to do that, so that we might do deeds different from those which we used to do Then if we go back to our former ways, we will indeed be wrongdoers.' The response will be: `There is no way for you to go back to the world.' Then the reason for that will be given: `Your nature will not accept the truth and be governed by it, you would reject it and ignore it.' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößõã ÈöÃóäøóåõ ÅöĞóÇ ÏõÚöìó Çááøóåõ æóÍúÏóåõ ßóÜİóÑúÊõãú æóÅöä íõÔúÑóßú Èöåö ÊõÄúãöäõæÇú</div><br>  ((It will be said): "This is because, when Allah Alone was invoked (in worship), you disbelieved; but when partners were joined to Him, you believed!'') meaning, `if you were to go back, this is how you would be.' This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÑõÏøõæÇú áóÚóÜÏõæÇú áöãóÇ äõåõæÇú Úóäúåõ æóÅöäøóåõãú áóßóÜĞöÈõæäó</div><br>  (But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that when they were forbidden.

He guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills; He has mercy on whomsoever He wills and punishes whomsoever He wills; there is no God except Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöì íõÑöíßõãú ÁóÇíóÜÊöåö</div><br>  (It is He Who shows you His Ayat) means, He demonstrates His power to His servants through the mighty signs which they see in His creation, above and below, which indicate the perfection of its Creator and Originator.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõäóÒøöáõ áóßõã ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ÑöÒúŞÇğ</div><br>  (and sends down provision for you from the sky.) this refers to rain, through which crops and fruits are brought forth, which with their different colors, tastes, fragrances and forms are a sign of the Creator. It is one kind of water, but by His great power He makes all these things different.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÊóĞóßøóÑõ</div><br>  (And none remembers) means, no one learns a lesson or is reminded by these things, or takes them as a sign of the might of the Creator,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóä íõäöíÈõ</div><br>  (but those who turn in repentance.) which means, those who have insight and turn to Allah, may He be blessed and exalted. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Believers are commanded to worship Allah Alone no matter what Their Circumstances</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÏúÚõæÇú Çááøóåó ãõÎúáöÕöíäó áóåõ ÇáÏøöíäó æóáóæú ßóÑöåó ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó </div><br>  (So, call you upon Allah making religion sincerely for Him, however much the disbelievers may hate.) This means, worship Allah and call upon Him alone in all sincerity. Do not be like the idolators in conduct and beliefs. Imam Ahmad recorded that after ending every prayer, `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr used to say: "There is no (true) God except Allah Alone with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and praise, for He is able to do all things; there is no strength and no power except with Allah; there is no (true) God except Allah and we worship none but Him; to Him belongs the blessings and the virtue and good praise; there is no (true) God except Allah, we worship Him in all sincerity even though the disbelievers may hate that.'' He said, "The Messenger of Allah used to say Tahlil with this after every prayer.'' Something similar was also recorded by Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. It was reported in Sahih from Ibn Az-Zubayr, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah used to say the following after the prescribed (obligatory) prayers:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ æóÍúÏóåõ áóÇ ÔóÑöíßó áóåõ¡ áóåõ Çáúãõáúßõ æóáóåõ ÇáúÍóãúÏõ¡ æóåõæó Úóáì ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ¡ áóÇ Íóæúáó æóáóÇ ŞõæøóÉó ÅöáøóÇ ÈöÇááåö¡ áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ¡ æóáóÇ äóÚúÈõÏõ ÅöáøóÇ ÅöíøóÇåõ¡ áóåõ ÇáäøöÚúãóÉõ æóáóåõ ÇáúİóÖúáõ æóáóåõ ÇáËøóÜÜäóÇÁõ ÇáúÍóÓóäõ¡ áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ ãõÎúáöÕöíäó áóåõ ÇáÏøöíäó æóáóæú ßóÑöåó ÇáúßóÇİöÑõæä»</div><br>  (There is no (true) God except Allah Alone with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and praise, for He is able to do all things; there is no strength and no power except with Allah; there is no (true) God except Allah and we worship none but Him; His is the blessing and virtue and good praise; there is no (true) God except Allah, we worship Him in all sincerity even though the disbelievers hate that.)  </div></body></html>
