Glory be to Allah above this Shirk and Kufr. If someone asks, how did the idolators worship the Jinns, although they only were idol worshippers The answer is that in fact, they worshipped the idols by obeying the Jinns who commanded them to do so.

Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah.'' And whoever takes Shaytan as a protector instead of Allah, has surely suffered a manifest loss. He Shaytan makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan's promises are nothing but deceptions. ) 4:117-120 and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÊóÊøóÎöĞõæäóåõ æóĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõ ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó ãöä Ïõæäöì</div><br>  (Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me) 18:50 Ibrahim said to his father,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóÈóÊö áÇó ÊóÚúÈõÏö ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäó Åöäøó ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäó ßóÇäó áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÚóÕöíøÇğ </div><br>  ("O my father!

Allah mentions the misguidance of those who were led astray and claimed a son or offspring for Him, as the Jews did with `Uzayr, the Christians with `Isa and the Arab pagans with the angels whom they claimed were Allah's daughters. Allah is far holier than what the unjust, polytheist people associate with Him. The word, Kharaqu, means `falsely attributed, invented, claimed and lied', according to the scholars of the Salaf.
