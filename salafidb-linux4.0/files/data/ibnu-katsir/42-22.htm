When it comes to His provision, the righteous and the sinner are alike. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ãöä ÏóÂÈøóÉò İöí ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöáÇøó Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÑöÒúŞõåóÇ æóíóÚúáóãõ ãõÓúÊóŞóÑøóåóÇ æóãõÓúÊóæúÏóÚóåóÇ ßõáøñ İöì ßöÊóÇÈò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  (And no moving creature is there on the earth but its provision is due from Allah.

(11:6) And there are many similar Ayat.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÑúÒõŞõ ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (He gives provisions to whom He wills.) means, He gives generously to whomsoever He wills.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáúŞóæöìøõ ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ</div><br>  (And He is the All-Strong, the Almighty.) means, there is nothing that can overpower Him.

So the one who strives with this intention in mind will have the worst deal in this world and in the Hereafter. The evidence for that is the fact that this Ayah is reinforced by the passage in Subhan (i.e., Surat Al-Isra') in which Allah says: y   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóä ßóÇäó íõÑöíÏõ ÇáúÚóÜÌöáóÉó ÚóÌøóáúäóÇ áóåõ İöíåóÇ ãóÇ äóÔóÂÁõ áöãóä äøõÑöíÏõ Ëõãøó ÌóÚóáúäóÇ áóåõ Ìóåóäøóãó íóÕúáóÜåóÇ ãóĞúãõæãğÇ ãøóÏúÍõæÑğÇ - æóãóäú ÃóÑóÇÏó ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉó æóÓóÚóì áóåóÇ ÓóÚúíóåóÇ æóåõæó ãõÄúãöäñ İóÃõæáóÜÆößó ßóÇäó ÓóÚúíõåõã ãøóÔúßõæÑğÇ - ßõáÇøğ äøõãöÏøõ åóÜÄõáÇÁö æóåóÜÄõáÇÁö ãöäú ÚóØóÂÁö ÑóÈøößó æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÚóØóÂÁõ ÑóÈøößó ãóÍúÙõæÑğÇ - ÇäÙõÑú ßóíúİó İóÖøóáúäóÇ ÈóÚúÖóåõãú Úóáóì ÈóÚúÖò æóáóáÇøñÎöÑóÉõ ÃóßúÈóÑõ ÏóÑóÌóÜÊò æóÃóßúÈóÑõ ÊóİúÖöíáÇğ </div><br>  (Whoever desires the quick-passing, We readily grant him what We will for whom We like.

See how We prefer one above another (in this world), and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment.) (17:18-21) It was reported that Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóÔøöÑú åĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉó ÈöÇáÓøóäóÇÁö æóÇáÑøöİúÚóÉö æóÇáäøóÕúÑö æóÇáÊøóãúßöíäö İöí ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ İóãóäú Úóãöáó ãöäúåõãú Úóãóáó ÇáúÇÎöÑóÉö áöáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ áóãú íóßõäú áóåõ İöí ÇáúÇÎöÑóÉö ãöäú äóÕöíÈ»</div><br>  (Give the glad tidings to this Ummah of sublimity, high status, victory and power in the land.

They instituted taboos, such as the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah or Ham. They also permitted eating flesh and blood of animals not slaughtered for consumption, gambling and other kinds of misguidance, ignorance and falsehood. These are things that they invented during Jahiliyyah, when they came up with all kinds of false rulings on what was permitted and what was forbidden, and false rites of worship and other corrupt ideas. It was recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑóÃóíúÊõ ÚóãúÑóæ Èúäó áõÍóíøö Èúäö ŞóãóÚóÉó íóÌõÑøõ ŞõÕúÈóåõ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (I saw `Amr bin Luhayy bin Qama`ah dragging his intestines in Hell) -- because he had been the first one to introduce the idea of the Sa'ibah. This man was one of the kings of the Khuza`ah tribe, and he was the first one to do these things. He was the one who had made the Quraysh worship idols, may the curse of Allah be upon him. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæúáÇó ßóáöãóÉõ ÇáúİóÕúáö áóŞõÖöìó Èóíúäóåõãú</div><br>  (And had it not been for a decisive Word, the matter would have been judged between them.) means, the punishment would have been hastened for them, were it not for the fact that it had already been decreed that it would be delayed until the Day of Resurrection.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó áóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ</div><br>  (And verily, for the wrongdoers there is a painful torment.) i.e., an agonizing torment in Hell, what a terrible destination. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Terror of the Idolators in the Place of Gathering</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÑóì ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó ãõÔúİöŞöíäó ãöãøóÇ ßóÓóÈõæÇú</div><br>  (You will see the wrongdoers fearful of that which they have earned,) means, in the arena of Resurrection.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó æóÇŞöÚñ Èöåöãú</div><br>  (and it will surely befall them.) means, the thing that they fear will undoubtedly happen to them.

What comparison can there be between the former and the latter How can the one who will be in the arena of resurrection in a state of humiliation and fear, deserving it for his wrongdoing, be compared with the one who will be in the gardens of Paradise, enjoying whatever he wants of food, drink, clothing, dwellings, scenery, spouses and other delights such as no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and has never crossed the minds of men. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó åõæó ÇáúİóÖúáõ ÇáúßóÈöíÑõ</div><br>  (That is the supreme grace.) means, the ultimate victory and complete blessing.  </div></body></html>
