They used to go around in the marketplaces seeking to engage in trade and earn a livelihood. This should not, however, affect their status as Messengers, for Allah gave them good characteristics and caused them to speak fine words and do noble deeds, and gave them miracles and clear proofs, from which any person with sound insight may see the confirmation that what they brought from Allah was true. This Ayah is similar to the Ayat;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ÅöáÇøó ÑöÌóÇáÇğ äøõæÍöì Åöáóíúåöãú ãøöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúŞõÑóì</div><br>  (And We sent not before you any but men unto whom We revealed, from among the people of townships) (12:109).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÜåõãú ÌóÓóÏÇğ áÇøó íóÃúßõáõæäó ÇáØøóÚóÇãó</div><br>  (And We did not create them bodies that ate not food) (21:8).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ÈóÚúÖóßõãú áöÈóÚúÖò İöÊúäóÉğ ÃóÊóÕúÈöÑõæäó</div><br>  (And We have made some of you as a trial for others; will you have patience) means, `We test some of you by means of others, so that We may see who will be obedient and who will be disobedient.' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊóÕúÈöÑõæäó æóßóÇäó ÑóÈøõßó ÈóÕöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (will you have patience And your Lord is Ever All-Seer.) meaning, He knows who deserves to receive revelation, as Allah says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÍóíúËõ íóÌúÚóáõ ÑöÓóÇáóÊóåõ</div><br>  (Allah knows best with whom to place His Message) (6:124). And He knows who deserves to be guided to the Message with which He sent them, and who does not deserve to be guided.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ÈóÚúÖóßõãú áöÈóÚúÖò İöÊúäóÉğ ÃóÊóÕúÈöÑõæäó</div><br>  (And We have made some of you as a trial for others. Will you have patience) Muhammad bin Ishaq said: Allah is saying, "If I had willed that the world be such that no one would oppose My Messengers, I could have made it so, but I wanted to test My servants by means of them.'' In Sahih Muslim it is narrated from `Iyad bin Himar that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáì: Åöäøöí ãõÈúÊóáöíßó æóãõÈúÊóáò Èöß»</div><br>  (Allah says: "I will test you and test others by means of you.'') In the Sahih it is recorded that he was given the choice between being a Prophet and king, or being a servant and Messenger, and he chose to be a servant and Messenger.  </div></body></html>
