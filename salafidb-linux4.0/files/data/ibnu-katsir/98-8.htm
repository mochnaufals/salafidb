He says that they will be in the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement and they will abide therein forever. This means that they will remain in it and they will have no way out of it and they will not cease being in it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóæúáóÜÆößó åõãú ÔóÑøõ ÇáúÈóÑöíøóÉö</div><br>  (They are the worst of creatures.) meaning, they are the worst creation that Allah has fashioned and created. Then Allah informs about the situation of the righteous people who believed in their hearts and performed righteous deeds with their bodies. He says that they are the best of creation. Abu Hurayrah and a group of the scholars have used this Ayah as a proof that the believers have a status among the creatures that is better than the angels. This is because Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãú ÎóíúÑõ ÇáúÈóÑöíøóÉö</div><br>  (They are the best of creatures.) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌóÒóÂÄõåõãú ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  (Their reward with their Lord) meaning, on the Day of Judgement.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌóäøóÜÊõ ÚóÏúäò ÊóÌúÑöì ãöäú ÊóÍúÊöåóÇ ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÂ ÃóÈóÏÇğ</div><br>  (is Eternal Gardens underneath which rivers flow. They will abide therein forever,) meaning, having no end, no break and no conclusion.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøöÖöìó Çááøóåõ Úóäúåõãú æóÑóÖõæÇú Úóäúåõ</div><br>  (Allah will be pleased with them, and they well-pleased with Him.) The condition of Him being pleased with them is more illustri- ous than all of the everlasting delights that they will be given.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÖõæÇú Úóäúåõ</div><br>  (and they well-pleased with Him.) Due to the comprehensive favors He has given them. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó áöãóäú ÎóÔöìó ÑóÈøóåõ</div><br>  (That is for him who fears his Lord.) meaning, this is the reward that will be attained by those who revere Allah and fear Him as He deserves to be feared. This is the person who worships Allah as if he sees Him, and he knows that even though he does not see Him, indeed Allah sees him. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ÃõÎúÈöÑõßõãú ÈöÎóíúÑö ÇáúÈóÑöíøóÉö¿»</div><br>  (Shall I not inform you of the best of creation) They said, "Of course, O Messenger of Allah!'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑóÌõáñ ÂÎöĞñ ÈöÚöäóÇäö İóÑóÓöåö İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö¡ ßõáøóãóÇ ßóÇäóÊú åóíúÚóÉñ ÇÓúÊóæóì Úóáóíúåö.

Shall I not inform you of the best of creation) They said, "Of course, O Messenger of Allah!'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑóÌõáñ İöí ËõáøóÉò ãöäú Ûóäóãöåö¡ íõŞöíãõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó æóíõÄúÊöí ÇáÒøóßóÇÉó. ÃóáóÇ ÃõÎúÈöÑõßõãú ÈöÔóÑøö ÇáúÈóÑöíøóÉö¿»</div><br>  (A man who has a flock of sheep and he establishes the prayer and gives the obligatory charity. Shall I not inform you of the worst of creation) They said, "Of course.'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáøóĞöí íõÓúÃóáõ ÈöÇááåö æóáóÇ íõÚúØöí Èöå»</div><br>  (The person who is asked by Allah and he does not give by Him.) This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Lam Yakun (Al-Bayyinah), and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
