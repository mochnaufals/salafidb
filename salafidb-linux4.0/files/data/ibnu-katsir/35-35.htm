"Who, out of His grace, has lodged us in a home that will last forever, where toil will touch us not nor weariness will touch us.'')  Allah tells us that those whom He chose among His servants, those who inherited the Book which was revealed from the Lord of the worlds, will, on the Day of Resurrection, have an abode in Everlasting Gardens which they will enter on the Day when they are raised anew and meet Allah.</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÍóáøóæúäó İöíåóÇ ãöäú ÃóÓóÇæöÑó ãöä ĞóåóÈò æóáõÄúáõÄÇğ</div><br>  (therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls,) It was recorded in the Sahih from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóÈúáõÛõ ÇáúÍöáúíóÉõ ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäö ÍóíúËõ íóÈúáõÛõ ÇáúæóÖõæÁ»</div><br>  (The ornaments of the believer will reach as far as his Wudu'.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöÈóÇÓõåõãú İöíåóÇ ÍóÑöíÑñ</div><br>  (and their garments therein will be of silk.) For this reason it is forbidden for them (the males) in this world, but Allah will permit it for them in the Hereafter.

Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and others said, "He forgives them for their major sins, and appreciates even the smallest of their good deeds.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÃóÍóáøóäóÇ ÏóÇÑó ÇáúãõŞóÇãóÉö ãöä İóÖúáöåö</div><br>  (Who, out of His grace, has lodged us in a home that will last forever,) means, `Who has given us this position and status out of His grace and blessing and mercy, for our good deeds are not equivalent to this.' It was reported in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said: -   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóäú íõÏúÎöáó ÃóÍóÏğÇ ãöäúßõãú Úóãóáõåõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (None of you will enter Paradise by virtue of his good deeds.)

The words translated here as "toil'' and "weariness'' both mean exhaustion, as if what is meant by the negation of both is that neither their bodies nor their souls will become exhausted; and Allah knows best. They used to exhaust themselves in worshipping this world, but their obligations will come to an end when they enter Paradise, where they will enjoy eternal rest and repose.
