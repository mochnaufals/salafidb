Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõáú áøöáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó æóÇáÇøòãøöíøöíäó ÁóÃóÓúáóãúÊõãú İóÅöäú ÃóÓúáóãõæÇú İóŞóÏö ÇåúÊóÏóæÇú æøóÅöä ÊóæóáøóæúÇú İóÅöäøóãóÇ Úóáóíúßó ÇáúÈóáóÜÛõ æóÇááøóåõ ÈóÕöíÑñ ÈöÇáúÚöÈóÇÏö</div><br>  (And say to those who were given the Scripture and those who are illiterates: "Do you submit yourselves If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the message; and Allah is All-Seer of (His) servants.) (3:20) Mentioning the unlettered ones in specific here does not mean that Muhammad was only sent to them, because the blessing to the Arabs is greater than that of other nations. In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõ áóĞößúÑñ áøóßó æóáöŞóæúãößó</div><br>  (And verily, this is indeed a Reminder for you and your people) (43:44). Surely, the Qur'an is also a reminder for those other than Arabs to take heed. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäĞöÑú ÚóÔöíÑóÊóßó ÇáÇøñŞúÑóÈöíäó </div><br>  (And warn your tribe of near kindred.) (26:214) These Ayat do not negate Allah's statements,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íóÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ Åöäøöì ÑóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö Åöáóíúßõãú ÌóãöíÚğÇ</div><br>  (Say: "O mankind! verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.) (7:158), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøñäĞöÑóßõãú Èöåö æóãóä ÈóáóÛó</div><br>  (that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.) (6:19) and in His statement about the Qur'an,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóßúİõÑú Èöåö ãöäó ÇáÇøñÍúÒóÇÈö İóÇáäøóÇÑõ ãóæúÚöÏõåõ</div><br>  (But those of the groups that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place.) (11:17) There are other Ayat that indicate that his Message is universal. He, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, was sent to all people, mankind and the Jinns alike. We mentioned this meaning before in Surat Al-An`am producing various Ayat and Hadiths. All praise and thanks are to due to Allah. This Ayah testifies that Allah has indeed accepted the invocation of His friend Ibrahim when he supplicated Allah to send a Messenger to the people of Makkah from among them their own. One who will recite to them Allah's statements, purify them and teach them the Book and the Hikmah. So, Allah -- all praise and thanks be to Him -- sent him when the Messengers ceased and the way was obscure. Indeed it was a time when it was most needed. Especially since Allah hated the people of the earth, Arabs and non-Arabs alike, except for a few of the People of the Scripture, who kept to the true faith Allah the Exalted sent to `Isa bin Maryam, peace be upon him. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÈóÚóËó İöì ÇáÃõãøöíøöíäó ÑóÓõæáÇğ ãøöäúåõãú íóÊúáõæ Úóáóíúåöãú ÁóÇíóÜÊöåö æóíõÒóßøöíåöãú æóíõÚóáøöãõåõãõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó æóÇáúÍößúãóÉó æóÅöä ßóÇäõæÇú ãöä ŞóÈúáõ áóİöì Öóáóáò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  (He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Ayat, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and the Hikmah. And verily, they had been before in manifest error.) In ancient times, the Arabs used to adhere by the religion of Ibrahim, peace be upon him. They later changed, corrupted and contradicted it, choosing polytheism instead of Tawhid and doubts instead of certainty. They invented a religion that Allah did not legislate, just as the People of the Scriptures did when they changed and corrupted their Divine Books. Allah sent Muhammad , with a great divine legislation, perfect religion that is suitable for all humans and Jinns. In it, there is guidance and explanations of all that they need in this life and the Hereafter. It draws them closer to Paradise and Allah's pleasure and takes them away from the Fire and earning Allah's anger. In it, there is the final judgement for all types of doubts and suspicion for all major and minor matters of the religion. In Muhammad , Allah gathered all the good qualities of the Prophets before him, and gave him what He has never given the earlier and later generations of mankind. May Allah's peace and blessings be on Muhammad until the Day of Judgement. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Muhammad is the Messenger to Arabs and Non-Arabs alike</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÎóÑöíäó ãöäúåõãú áóãøóÇ íóáúÍóŞõæÇú Èöåöãú æóåõæó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÍóßöíãõ </div><br>  (And others among them who have not yet joined them. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.) Imam Abu `Abdullah Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy upon him, recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, "We were sitting with the Prophet , when Surat Al-Jumu`ah was revealed to him;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÎóÑöíäó ãöäúåõãú áóãøóÇ íóáúÍóŞõæÇú Èöåöãú</div><br>  (And others among them who have not yet joined them.) They said, `Who are they, O Allah's Messenger' The Prophet did not reply until they repeated the question thrice. At that time, Salman Al-Farisi was with us. So Allah's Messenger placed his hand on Salman, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú ßóÇäó ÇáúÅöíãóÇäõ ÚöäúÏó ÇáËøõÑóíøóÇ áóäóÇáóåõ ÑöÌóÇáñ Ãóæú ÑóÌõáñ ãöäú åÄõáóÇÁö»</div><br>  (If faith were on Ath-Thurayya (Pleiades), even then some men or a man from these people would attain it.)'' Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa`i, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir collected this Hadith. This Hadith indicates that Surat Al-Jumu`ah was revealed in Al-Madinah and that the Messenger's Message is universal. The Prophet explained Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÎóÑöíäó ãöäúåõãú</div><br>  (And others among them) by mentioning Persia. This is why the Prophet sent messages to the kings of Persia and Rome, among other kings, calling them to Allah the Exalted and to follow what he was sent with. This is why Mujahid and several others said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÎóÑöíäó ãöäúåõãú áóãøóÇ íóáúÍóŞõæÇú Èöåöãú</div><br>  (And others among them who have not yet joined them.) refers to all non-Arabs who believe in the truth of the Prophet. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÍóßöíãõ</div><br>  (And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.) asserts that He is Almighty and All-Wise in His legislation and the destiny He appoints. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó İóÖúáõ Çááøóåö íõÄúÊöíåö ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ æóÇááøóåõ Ğõæ ÇáúİóÖúáö ÇáúÚóÙöíãö </div><br>  (That is the grace of Allah, which He bestows on whom He wills. And Allah is the Owner of mighty grace.) refers to the great prophethood that He granted Muhammad and the qualities that He favored his Ummah with, by sending Muhammad to them.  </div></body></html>
