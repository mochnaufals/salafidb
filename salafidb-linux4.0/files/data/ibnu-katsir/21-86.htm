And (remember) Isma`il, Idris and Dhul-Kifl: All were from among the patient.) (86. And We admitted them to Our mercy. Verily, they were of the righteous.)  Isma`il, Idris and Dhul-Kifl Isma`il was the son of Ibrahim Al-Khalil, peace be upon them both. He has already been mentioned in Surah Maryam, where mention was also made of Idris. From the context and the fact that Dhul-Kifl is mentioned alongside Prophets, it appears that he was also a Prophet. Others say that he was a righteous man, a just king and a fair judge. Ibn Jarir refrained from making any decisive comment. And Allah knows best.</div>  </div></body></html>
