Would she hasten to say either that it was her throne or that it was not So he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóßøöÑõæÇú áóåóÇ ÚóÑúÔóåóÇ äóäÙõÑú ÃóÊóåúÊóÏöì Ãóãú Êóßõæäõ ãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóåúÊóÏõæäó</div><br>  (Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will be guided, or she will be one of those not guided.) Ibn `Abbas said: "Remove some of its adornments and parts.'' Mujahid said: "He issued orders that it should be changed, so whatever was red should be made yellow and vice versa, and whatever was green should be made red, so everything was altered.'' `Ikrimah said, "They added some things and took some things away.'' Qatadah said, "It was turned upside down and back to front, and some things were added and some things were taken away.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊú Şöíáó ÃóåóßóĞóÇ ÚóÑúÔõßö</div><br>  (So when she came, it was said: "Is your throne like this'') Her throne, which had been altered and disguised, with some things added and others taken away, was shown to her. She was wise and steadfast, intelligent and strong-willed. She did not hasten to say that this was her throne, because it was far away from her. Neither did she hasten to say that it was not her throne, when she saw that some things had been altered and changed. She said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÃóäøóåõ åõæó</div><br>  ((It is) as though it were the very same. ) This is the ultimate in intelligence and strong resolve.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõæÊöíäóÇ ÇáúÚöáúãó ãöä ŞóÈúáöåóÇ æóßõäøóÇ ãõÓúáöãöíäó</div><br>  (Knowledge was bestowed on us before her, and we had submitted to Allah.)

This is a continuation of the words of Sulayman -- according to the opinion of Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubayr, may Allah be pleased with them both -- i.e., Sulayman said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõæÊöíäóÇ ÇáúÚöáúãó ãöä ŞóÈúáöåóÇ æóßõäøóÇ ãõÓúáöãöíäó</div><br>  (Knowledge was bestowed on us before her, and we had submitted to Allah.) and what stopped her from worshipping Allah alone was   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ßóÇäóÊ ÊøóÚúÈõÏõ ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ÅöäøóåóÇ ßóÇäóÊú ãöä Şóæúãò ßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (that which she used to worship besides Allah, for she was of a disbelieving people.) What Mujahid and Sa`id said is good; it was also the view of Ibn Jarir. Then Ibn Jarir said, "It could be that the subject of the verb.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÕóÏøóåóÇ</div><br>  (And Saddaha) refers to Sulayman or to Allah, so that the phrase now means:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ßóÇäóÊ ÊøóÚúÈõÏõ ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (She would not worship anything over than Allah.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóåóÇ ßóÇäóÊú ãöä Şóæúãò ßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (for she was of a disbelieving people.) I say: the opinion of Mujahid is supported by the fact that she declared her Islam after she entered the Sarh, as we shall see below.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şöíáó áóåóÇ ÇÏúÎõáöì ÇáÕøóÑúÍó İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÃóÊúåõ ÍóÓöÈóÊúåõ áõÌøóÉğ æóßóÔóİóÊú Úóä ÓóÇŞóíúåóÇ</div><br>  (It was said to her: "Enter As-Sarh'' but when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she (tucked up her clothes) uncovering her legs.) Sulayman had commanded the Shayatin to build for her a huge palace of glass beneath which water was flowing. Anyone who did not know the nature of the building would think that it was water, but in fact there was a layer of glass between a person walking and the water. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Verily, it is a Sarh Mumarrad of Qawarir Sarh means a palace or any lofty construction.</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says of Fir`awn -- may Allah curse him -- that he said to his minister Haman:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÈúäö áöì ÕóÑúÍÇğ áøóÚóÜáøöì ÃóÈúáõÛõ ÇáÇøñÓúÈóÜÈó</div><br>  (Build me a Sarh that I may arrive at the ways.) (40:36-37) Sarh is also used to refer to the high constructed palaces in Yemen. Mumarrad means sturdily constructed and smooth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöä ŞóæÇÑöíÑó</div><br>  (of Qawarir) means, made of glass, i.e., it was built with smooth surfaces. Marid is a fortress in Dawmat Al-Jandal. What is meant here is that Sulayman built a huge, lofty palace of glass for this queen, in order to show her the greatness of his authority and power. When she saw for herself what Allah had given him and how majestic his position was, she submitted to the command of Allah and acknowledged that he was a noble Prophet, so she submitted to Allah and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈ Åöäøöì ÙóáóãúÊõ äóİúÓöì</div><br>  (My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself,) meaning, by her previous disbelief and Shirk and by the fact that she and her people had worshipped the sun instead of Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÓúáóãúÊõ ãóÚó ÓõáóíúãóÜäó áöáøóåö ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (and I submit, together with Sulayman to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.) meaning, following the religion of Sulayman, worshipping Allah alone with no partner or associate, Who created everything and measured it exactly according to its due measurements.  </div></body></html>
