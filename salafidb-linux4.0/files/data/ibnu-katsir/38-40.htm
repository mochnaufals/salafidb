Some of them said, "No one after me will have the right to ask Allah for such a kingdom.'' This is the apparent meaning from the context of the Ayah, and several Hadiths with a similar meaning have been narrated from the Messenger of Allah . In his Tafsir of this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÚöİúÑöíÊğÇ ãöäó ÇáúÌöäøö ÊóİóáøóÊó Úóáóíøó ÇáúÈóÇÑöÍóÉó Ãóæú ßóáöãóÉğ äóÍúæóåóÇ áöíóŞúØóÚó Úóáóíøó ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó İóÃóãúßóäóäöí Çááåõ ÊóÈóÇÑóßó æóÊóÚóÇáóì ãöäúåõ¡ æóÃóÑóÏúÊõ Ãóäú ÃóÑúÈöØóåõ Åöáóì ÓóÇÑöíóÉò ãöäó ÓóæóÇÑöí ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏö ÍóÊúì ÊõÕúÈöÍõæÇ¡æóÊóäúÙõÑõæÇ Åöáóíúåö ßõáøõßõãú¡ İóĞóßóÑúÊõ Şóæúáó ÃóÎöí ÓõáóíúãóÇäó Úóáóíúåö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉõ æóÇáÓøóáóÇãõ:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö ÇÛúİöÑú áöì æóåóÈú áöì ãõáúßÇğ áÇøó íóäÈóÛöì áÇøğÍóÏò ãøöä ÈóÚúÏöì»</div><br>  (An `Ifrit from among the Jinn came and bothered me last night- or he said something similar -Trying to stop me from praying. Allah enabled me to overpower him, and I wanted to tie him to one of the pillars in the Masjid so that you could see him this morning. Then I remembered what my brother Sulayman said, (My Lord! Forgive me and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me)) Rawh said, "so he let him go, humiliated.'' ) This was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Abu Ad-Darda', may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah stood up to pray and we heard him say, r   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÚõæĞõ ÈöÇááåö ãöäúß»</div><br>  (I seek refuge with Allah from you.) Then he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáúÚóäõßó ÈöáóÚúäóÉö Çááå»</div><br>  (I curse you with the curse of Allah.) three times, and he stretched out his hand as if he was reaching out to take something. When he finished his prayer, we said, `O Messenger of Allah, we heard you say something in your prayer which we have never heard you say before, and we saw you stretching out your hand.' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÚóÏõæøó Çááåö ÅöÈúáöíÓó ÌóÇÁó ÈöÔöåóÇÈò ãöäú äóÇÑò áöíóÌúÚóáóåõ İöí æóÌúåöí İóŞõáúÊõ: ÃóÚõæĞõ ÈöÇááåö ãöäúßó¡ ËóáóÇËó ãóÑøóÇÊò¡ Ëõãøó ŞõáúÊõ: ÃóáúÚóäõßó ÈöáóÚúäóÉö Çááåö ÇáÊøóÇãøóÉö¡ İóáóãú íóÊóÃóÎøóÑú¡ ËóáóÇËó ãóÑøóÇÊò Ëõãøó ÃóÑóÏúÊõ Ãóäú ÂÎõĞóåõ¡æóÇááåö áóæúáóÇ ÏóÚúæóÉõ ÃóÎöíäóÇ ÓõáóíúãóÇäó áóÃóÕúÈóÍó ãõæËóŞğÇ¡ íóáúÚóÈõ Èöåö ÕöÈúíóÇäõ Ãóåúáö ÇáúãóÏöíäóÉ»</div><br>  (The enemy of Allah Iblis came with a flame of fire to throw in my face, so I said, "I seek refuge with Allah from you'' three times, then I said, "I curse you with the complete curse of Allah,'' but he did not back off. I said it three times. Then I wanted to seize him. By Allah, if it were not for the words of our brother Sulayman, he would have been chained up and he would have become a plaything for the children of the people of Al-Madinah.)'' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóÎøóÑúäóÇ áóåõ ÇáÑøöíÍó ÊóÌúÑöì ÈöÃóãúÑöåö ÑõÎóÂÁğ ÍóíúËõ ÃóÕóÇÈó </div><br>  (So, We subjected to him the wind; it blew gently by his order wherever he willed.) Al-Hasan Al-Basri, may Allah have mercy on him, said, "When Sulayman, peace be upon him, slaughtered the horses out of anger for the sake of Allah, Allah compensated him with something better and swifter, the wind whose morning was a month's (journey), and its afternoon was a month's (journey).''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóíúËõ ÃóÕóÇÈó</div><br>  (wherever he willed.) means, wherever in the world he wanted.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäó ßõáøó ÈóäøóÂÁò æóÛóæøóÇÕò </div><br>  (And also the Shayatin, from every kind of builder and diver,) means, among them were some whom he used to build high rooms, images, basins as large as reservoirs, and cauldrons fixed (in their places), and other difficult tasks which humans were unable to do. And there was another group, who dived into the sea recovering pearls, jewels and other precious things which cannot be found anywhere else.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÎóÑöíäó ãõŞóÑøóäöíäó İöì ÇáÇøñÕúİóÇÏö </div><br>  (And also others bound in fetters.) means, tied up in chains.

Whatever you do is permissible for you, so however you judge, it will be right.' It was reported in the Two Sahihs that when the Messenger of Allah was given the choice between being a servant and a Messenger -- who does what he is commanded to do and distributes things among the people as Allah commands him to do -- or being a Prophet and a king, who can give to whomever he wishes and withhold from whomever he wishes without being held accountable for anything, he chose the former. He consulted with Jibril, peace be upon him, who said, "Be humble.'' So he chose the former because it has a greater value before Allah and brings a higher status in the Hereafter, even though the second option, prophethood combined with kingship, is also a great thing both in this world and in the Hereafter, when Allah tells us what He gave to Sulayman, peace be upon him, in this world, He tells us that he will have a great share with Allah on the Day of Resurrection. He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó áóåõ ÚöäÏóäóÇ áóÒõáúİóì æóÍõÓúäó ãóÜóÇÈò </div><br>  (And verily, for him is a near access to Us, and a good (final) return.) meaning, in this world and the Hereafter.  </div></body></html>
