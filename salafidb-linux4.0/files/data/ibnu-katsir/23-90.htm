He tells His Messenger Muhammad to say to the idolators who worship others besides Him, even though they admit His Lordship, that He has no partner in Lordship. But despite this they still attributed partners in divinity to Him, and worshipped others besides Him even though they recognized the fact that those whom they worshipped could not create anything, did not own anything, nor do they have any control over anything. However, they still believed that these creatures could bring them closer to Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ äóÚúÈõÏõåõãú ÅöáÇøó áöíõŞóÑøöÈõæäóÂ Åöáóì Çááøóåö Òõáúİóì</div><br>  (We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah) 39:3.
