Wazdujir.) Mujahid said about Wazdujir: "He was driven out accused on account of madness.'' It was also said that Wazdujir means, he was rebuked, deterred, threatened and warned by his people saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÆöäú áøóãú ÊóäúÊóåö íäõæÍõ áóÊóßõæäóäøó ãöäó ÇáúãõÑúÌõæãöíäó</div><br>  ("If you do not stop O Nuh, you will be among those who will be stoned.'') 26:116 This was said by Ibn Zayd, and it is sound.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÏóÚóÇ ÑóÈøóåõ Ãóäøõì ãóÛúáõæÈñ İóÇäÊóÕöÑú </div><br>  (Then he invoked his Lord (saying): "I have been overcome, so help (me)!'') meaning, `I am weak and cannot overcome or resist my people, so help Your religion!' Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóİóÊóÍúäóÂ ÃóÈúæóÈó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ÈöãóÇÁò ãøõäúåóãöÑò </div><br>  (So, We opened the gates of the heaven with water Munhamir.)

Ibn Jurayj reported from Ibn `Abbas:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóİóÊóÍúäóÂ ÃóÈúæóÈó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ÈöãóÇÁò ãøõäúåóãöÑò </div><br>  (So, We opened the gates of the heaven with water Munhamir), Torrential rain, the only water that fell from the sky before that day and ever since was from clouds. But the sky's gates were opened on them that day, and therefore, the water that came down was not from clouds. So both the waters (of the earth and the heaven) met according to a matter ordained.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍóãóáúäóÇåõ Úóáóì ĞóÇÊö ÃóáúæóÍò æóÏõÓõÑò </div><br>  (And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails (Dusur)), Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Qurazi, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said that Dusur means nails. Ibn Jarir preferred this view. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÌúÑöì ÈöÃóÚúíõäöäóÇ</div><br>  (Floating under Our Eyes), means, `by Our command and under Our protection and observation,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌóÒóÂÁğ áøöãóä ßóÇäó ßõİöÑó</div><br>  (a reward for him who had been rejected!) meaning, as recompense for them because of their disbelief in Allah and as reward for Nuh, peace be upon him.

Qatadah said, "Allah left the ship of Nuh intact until the first generation of this Ummah were able to see it.'' However, it appears that the meaning here is that Allah kept ships as a sign. For instance, Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇíóÉñ áøóåõãú ÃóäøóÇ ÍóãóáúäóÇ ĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõãú İöì Çáúİõáúßö ÇáúãóÔúÍõæäö - æóÎóáóŞúäóÇ áóåõãú ãøöä ãøöËúáöåö ãóÇ íóÑúßóÈõæäó </div><br>  (And a sign for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship.
