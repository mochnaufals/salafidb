But those who reject Our Ayat, the torment will strike them for their rebelling.)  Allah said to His Messenger, say, O Muhammad , to those rebellious liars,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÑóÃóíúÊõãú Åöäú ÃóÎóĞó Çááøóåõ ÓóãúÚóßõãú æóÃóÈúÕóÜÑóßõãú</div><br>  (Tell me, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight.) just as He gave these senses to you.

The Ayah above might also mean that Allah will not allow the disbelievers to benefit from these senses in religious terms. This is why He said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÎóÊóãó Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈößõãú</div><br>  (and sealed up your hearts,.) He also said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãøóä íóãúáößõ ÇáÓøóãúÚó æÇáÇøñÈúÕóÜÑó</div><br>  (Or who owns hearing and sight) 10:31, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÚúáóãõæÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó íóÍõæáõ Èóíúäó ÇáúãóÑúÁö æóŞóáúÈöåö</div><br>  (And know that Allah comes in between a person and his heart.)

After this explanation, they still turn away from the truth and hinder people from following it. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóÑóÃóíúÊóßõãú Åöäú ÃóÊóÜßõãú ÚóĞóÇÈõ Çááøóåö ÈóÛúÊóÉğ</div><br>  (Say: "Tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly...'') means, while you are unaware -- or during the night -- striking you all of a sudden,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÌóåúÑóÉğ</div><br>  (or openly) during the day, or publicly,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú íõåúáóßõ ÅöáÇøó ÇáúŞóæúãõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãõæäó</div><br>  (will any be destroyed except the wrongdoing people) This torment only strikes those who commit injustice against themselves by associating others with Allah, while those who worship Allah alone without partners will be saved from it, and they will have no fear or sorrow. In another Ayah, Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóáóãú íóáúÈöÓõæÇú ÅöíãóÜäóåõãú ÈöÙõáúãò</div><br>  (It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with Zulm, (wrong or Shirk).) 6:82 Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ äõÑúÓöáõ ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíäó ÅöáÇøó ãõÈóÔøöÑöíäó æóãõäĞöÑöíäó</div><br>  (And We send not the Messengers but as bearers of glad tidings and as warners.) means, the Messengers bring good news to Allah's servants, as well as, command all that is good and righteous. They also warn those who disbelieve in Allah of His anger and of all types of torment. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóäú ÁóÇãóäó æóÃóÕúáóÍó</div><br>  (So whosoever believes and does righteous good deeds.) meaning, whoever believes in his heart with what the Messengers were sent with and makes his works righteous by imitating them;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó Îóæúİñ Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (upon such shall come no fear,) concerning the future,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó åõãú íóÍúÒóäõæäó</div><br>  (nor shall they grieve.) about what they missed in the past and left behind them in this world. Certainly, Allah will be the Wali and Protector over what they left behind. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóĞøóÈõæÇú ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ íóãóÓøõåõãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóİúÓõŞõæäó </div><br>  (But those who reject Our Ayat, the torment will strike them for their rebelling.) The torment will strike them because of disbelieving in the Message of the Messengers, defying Allah's commands, committing what He prohibited and transgressing His set limits.  </div></body></html>
