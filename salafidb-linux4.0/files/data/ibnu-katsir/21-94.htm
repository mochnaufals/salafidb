Al-Hasan Al-Basri said: "In this Ayah, Allah explains to them what they should avoid and what they should do.'' Then He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóÜĞöåö ÃõãøóÊõßõãú ÃõãøóÉğ æóÇÍöÏóÉğ</div><br>  (Truly, this, your Ummah is one religion,) "Meaning, your path is one path. Certainly this is your Shari`ah (Divine Law) which I have clearly explained you.'' So Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäóÇú ÑóÈøõßõãú İóÇÚúÈõÏõæäö</div><br>  (and I am your Lord, therefore worship Me.) This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáÑøõÓõáõ ßõáõæÇú ãöäó ÇáØøóíøöÈóÜÊö æóÇÚúãóáõæÇú ÕóÜáöÍÇğ</div><br>  (O (you) Messengers!

Until His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäóÇú ÑóÈøõßõãú İóÇÊøóŞõæäö</div><br>  (And I am your Lord, so have Taqwa of Me.) 23:51-52 The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÍúäõ ãóÚóÇÔöÑó ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁö ÃóæúáóÇÏõ ÚóáøóÇÊò ÏöíäõäóÇ æóÇÍöÏ»</div><br>  (We Prophets are brothers from different mothers and our religion is one.) What is meant here is that they all worshipped Allah Alone with no partner or associate, although the Laws of each Messenger may have differed, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áößõáøò ÌóÚóáúäóÇ ãöäßõãú ÔöÑúÚóÉğ æóãöäúåóÜÌÇğ</div><br>  (To each among you, We have prescribed a Law and a clear way) 5:48   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóŞóØøóÚõæÇú ÃóãúÑóåõãú Èóíúäóåõãú</div><br>  (But they have broken up and differed in their religion among themselves.) meaning, the nations were divided over their Messengers; some of them believed in them and some rejected them. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøñ ÅöáóíúäóÇ ÑóÌöÚõæäó</div><br>  ((And) they all shall return to Us.) meaning, `on the Day of Resurrection, when We will requite each person according to his deeds. If they are good, then he will be rewarded and if they are evil then he will be punished.' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä íóÚúãóáú ãöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö æóåõæó ãõÄúãöäñ</div><br>  (So whoever does righteous good deeds while he is a believer,) meaning, his heart believes and his deeds are righteous.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ßõİúÑóÇäó áöÓóÚúíöåö</div><br>  (his efforts will not be rejected. ) This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ áÇó äõÖöíÚõ ÃóÌúÑó ãóäú ÃóÍúÓóäó ÚóãóáÇğ</div><br>  (certainly We shall not make the reward of anyone who does his deeds in the most perfect manner to be lost.) 18:30 which means, his efforts will not be wasted; they will be appreciated and not even a speck of dust's weight of injustice will be done. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóÇ áóåõ ßóÜÊöÈõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, We record it for him.) means, all his deeds are recorded and nothing of them at all is lost.  </div></body></html>
