From a little He makes a lot, and creates the clouds that look like shields. Then He spreads them out until they fill the horizon. Sometimes the clouds come from the sea, heavy and full, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íõÑúÓöáõ ÇáÑøöíóÇÍó ÈõÔúÑìğ Èóíúäó íóÏóìú ÑóÍúãóÊöåö ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÂ ÃóŞóáøóÊú ÓóÍóÇÈğÇ ËöŞóÇáÇğ ÓõŞúäóÜåõ áöÈóáóÏò ãøóíøöÊò</div><br>  (And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy.

(7:57) Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì íõÑúÓöáõ ÇáÑøöíóÜÍó İóÊõËöíÑõ ÓóÍóÇÈÇğ İóíóÈúÓõØõåõ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ßóíúİó íóÔóÂÁõ æóíóÌúÚóáõåõ ßöÓóİÇğ</div><br>  (Allah is He Who sends the winds, so that they raise clouds and spread them along the sky as He wills, and then break them into fragments) Mujahid, Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala', Matar Al-Warraq and Qatadah said, "This means pieces.'' Others said that it means `piled up,' as Ad-Dahhak said. Others said that it means black, because they contained so much water, and sometimes they are heavy and close to the earth. His saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóÑóì ÇáúæóÏúŞó íóÎúÑõÌõ ãöäú ÎöáÇóáöåö</div><br>  (until you see rain drops come forth from their midst!) means, `so you see the drops, i.e., the rain, which come from the midst of those clouds.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÂ ÃóÕóÇÈó Èöåö ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö ÅöĞóÇ åõãú íóÓúÊóÈúÔöÑõæäó</div><br>  (Then when He has made them fall on whom of His servants as He wills, lo, they rejoice!) They rejoice at the rain when it comes to them because of their need for it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ßóÇäõæÇú ãöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä íõäóÒøóáó Úóáóíúåöãú ãøöä ŞóÈúáöåö áóãõÈúáöÓöíäó </div><br>  (And verily, before that -- just before it was sent down upon them -- they were in despair!) The people to whom this rain came were in despair, thinking that it rain would never fall, just before it came to them. When it came to them, it came at the time of greatest need, so it was a tremendous event for them What this means is that they were in need of it before it fell, and there had been no rainfall for a long time, so they were waiting for it at the time when it was due, but it did not come to them at that time. The rain was late, and a long time passed. Then the rain came to them suddenly, after they began to despair, and after their land became dry and barren, it was stirred to life, and it swelled and produced every lovely kind of growth. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇäÙõÑú Åöáóì ÁóÇËóÜÑö ÑóÍúãóÉö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Look then at the effects of Allah's mercy,) meaning, the rain.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóíúİó íõÍúìö ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ÈóÚúÏó ãóæúÊöåóÂ</div><br>  (how He revives the earth after its death.) Thus Allah draws attention to the revival of people's bodies after they have died and disintegrated into nothing.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Ğóáößó áóãõÍúìö ÇáúãóæúÊóì</div><br>  (Verily, that (Allah) shall indeed raise the dead.) means, the One Who does that is able to raise the dead.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ</div><br>  (and He is able to do all things.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöäú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ÑöíÍğÇ İóÑóÃóæúåõ ãõÕúİóÑøÇğ áøóÙóáøõæÇú ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåö íóßúİõÑõæäó </div><br>  (And if We send a wind, and they see it turn yellow -- behold, they then would become unthankful (disbelievers).)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöäú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ÑöíÍğÇ</div><br>  (And if We send a wind,) means, a wind which dries up the crops which they have tended and cultivated and which have matured, and they see them turn yellow, and start to rot, if this were to happen, they would become ungrateful, i.e., they would deny the previous blessings that they were given. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÑóÁóíúÊõã ãøóÇ ÊóÍúÑõËõæäó </div><br>  (Then tell Me about the seed that you sow in the ground.) until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú äóÍúäõ ãóÍúÑõæãõæäó </div><br>  (Nay, but we are deprived!)
