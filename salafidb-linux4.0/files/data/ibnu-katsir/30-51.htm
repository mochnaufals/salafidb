He is originally created from dust, then from a Nutfah, then from a clot, then from a lump of flesh. Then he becomes bones, then the bones are clothed with flesh, then the soul is breathed into him. Then he emerges from his mother's womb, weak and thin and powerless. Then he grows up little by little, until he becomes a child, then he reaches the stage of puberty, then he becomes a young man, which is strength after weakness. Then he starts to get older, reaching middle age, then old age and senility, weakness after strength, so he loses his resolve, power of movement and ability to fight, his hair turns grey and his characteristics, both inward and outward, begin to change. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÌóÚóáó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ŞõæøóÉò ÖóÚúİÇğ æóÔóíúÈóÉğ íóÎúáõŞõ ãóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills.) He does whatsoever He wills and controls His servants in whatever way He wants.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáúÚóáöíãõ ÇáúŞóÏöíÑõ</div><br>  (And He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.)  </div></body></html>
