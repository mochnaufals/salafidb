It is not Birr that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west; but Birr is the one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to the kinsfolk, to the orphans, and to Al-Masakin (the poor), and to the wayfarer, and to those who ask, and to set servants free, performs As-Salah (Iqamat-As-Salah), and gives the Zakah, and who fulfill their covenant when they make it, and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles).

As for the explanation of this Ayah, Allah first commanded the believers to face Bayt Al-Maqdis, and then to face the Ka`bah during the prayer. This change was difficult for some of the People of the Book, and even for some Muslims. Then Allah sent revelation which clarified the wisdom behind this command, that is, obedience to Allah, adhering to His commands, facing wherever He commands facing, and implementing whatever He legislates, that is the objective. This is Birr, Taqwa and complete faith. Facing the east or the west does not necessitate righteousness or obedience, unless it is legislated by Allah. This is why Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíúÓó ÇáúÈöÑøó Ãóä ÊõæóáøõæÇú æõÌõæåóßõãú ŞöÈóáó ÇáúãóÔúÑöŞö æóÇáúãóÛúÑöÈö æóáóÜßöäøó ÇáúÈöÑøó ãóäú ÁóÇãóäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóÇáúíóæúãö ÇáÇøñÎöÑö</div><br>  (It is not Birr that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Birr is the one who believes in Allah and the Last Day,)  Similarly, Allah said about the sacrifices:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä íóäóÇáó Çááøóåó áõÍõæãõåóÇ æóáÇó ÏöãóÂÄõåóÇ æóáóÜßöä íóäóÇáõåõ ÇáÊøóŞúæóì ãöäßõãú</div><br>  (It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is the piety from you that reaches Him.) (22:37)  Abu Al-`Aliyah said, "The Jews used to face the west for their Qiblah, while the Christians used to face the east for their Qiblah. So Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíúÓó ÇáúÈöÑøó Ãóä ÊõæóáøõæÇú æõÌõæåóßõãú ŞöÈóáó ÇáúãóÔúÑöŞö æóÇáúãóÛúÑöÈö</div><br>  (It is not Birr that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers)) (2: 177) meaning, "this is faith, and its essence requires implementation.'' Similar was reported from Al-Hasan and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Ath-Thawri recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöäøó ÇáúÈöÑøó ãóäú ÁóÇãóäó ÈöÇááøóåö</div><br>  (but Birr is the one who believes in Allah,) and said that what follows are the types of Birr. He has said the truth. Certainly, those who acquire the qualities mentioned in the Ayah will have indeed embraced all aspects of Islam and implemented all types of righteousness; believing in Allah, that He is the only God worthy of worship, and believing in the angels the emissaries between Allah and His Messengers.  The `Books' are the Divinely revealed Books from Allah to the Prophets, which were finalized by the most honorable Book (the Qur'an). The Qur'an supercedes all previous Books, it mentions all types of righteousness, and the way to happiness in this life and the Hereafter. The Qur'an abrogates all previous Books and testfies to all of Allah's Prophets, from the first Prophet to the Final Prophet, Muhammad, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon them all.  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóì ÇáúãóÇáó Úóáóì ÍõÈøöåö</div><br>  (...and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it,) refers to those who give money away while desiring it and loving it. It is recorded in the Sahihayn that Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóİúÖóáõ ÇáÕøóÏóŞÉö Ãóäú ÊóÕóÏøóŞó æóÃóäúÊó ÕóÍöíÍñ ÔóÍöíÍñ¡ ÊóÃúãõáõ ÇáúÛöäóì æÊóÎúÔóì ÇáúİŞúÑ»</div><br>  (The best charity is when you give it away while still healthy and thrifty, hoping to get rich and fearing poverty.)  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõØúÚöãõæäó ÇáØøóÚóÇãó Úóáóì ÍõÈøöåö ãöÓúßöíäÇğ æóíóÊöíãÇğ æóÃóÓöíÑÇğ - ÅöäøóãóÇ äõØúÚöãõßõãú áöæóÌúåö Çááøóåö áÇó äõÑöíÏõ ãöäßõãú ÌóÒóÂÁğ æóáÇó ÔõßõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (And they give food, inspite of their love for it, to the Miskin (the poor), the orphan, and the captive (saying): "We feed you seeking Allah's Face only. We wish for no reward, nor thanks from you.'') (76:8, 9)  and:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä ÊóäóÇáõæÇú ÇáúÈöÑøó ÍóÊøóì ÊõäİöŞõæÇú ãöãøóÇ ÊõÍöÈøõæäó</div><br>  (By no means shall you attain Birr unless you spend of that which you love.) (3:92) Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÄúËöÑõæäó Úóáóì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú æóáóæú ßóÇäó Èöåöãú ÎóÕóÇÕóÉñ</div><br>  (...and give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that) (59:9) refers to a higher category and status, as the people mentioned here give away what they need, while those mentioned in the previous Ayat give away what they covet (but not necessarily need).  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóæöì ÇáúŞõÑúÈóì</div><br>  (the kinsfolk) refers to man's relatives, who have more rights than anyone else to one's charity, as the Hadith supports:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉõ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÓóÇßöíäö ÕóÏóŞóÉñ¡ æÚóáóì Ğöí ÇáÑøóÍöãö ÇËúäÊóÇäö: ÕóÏóŞóÉñ æóÕöáóÜÉñ¡ İóåõãú Ãóæúáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö Èößó æóÈöÈöÑøößó æóÅöÚúØóÇÆöß»</div><br>  (Sadaqah (i. e., charity) given to the poor is a charity, while the Sadaqah given to the relatives is both Sadaqah and Silah (nurturing relations), for they are the most deserving of you and your kindness and charity).  Allah has commanded kindness to the relatives in many places in the Qur'an.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúíóÊóÜãóì</div><br>  (to the orphans) The orphans are children who have none to look after them, having lost their fathers while they are still young, weak and unable to find their own sustenance since they have not reached the age of work and adolescence. `Abdur-Razzaq reported that `Ali said that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãóÓóÜßöíäõ</div><br>  (and to Al-Masakin) The Miskin is the person who does not have enough food, clothing, or he has no dwelling. So the Miskin should be granted the provisions to sustain him enough so that he can acquire his needs. In the Sahihayn it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóíúÓó ÇáúãöÓúßöíäõ ÈöåĞóÇ ÇáØøóæøóÇİö ÇáøóĞöí ÊóÑõÏøõå ÇáÊøóãúÑóÉõ æÇáÊøóãúÑóÊóÇäö¡ æÇááøõŞúãóÉõ æÇááøõŞúãóÊóÇäö¡ æóáßöäö ÇáúãöÓúßöíäõ ÇáøóĞöí áóÇ íóÌöÏõ Ûöäìğ íõÛúäöíå æóáóÇ íõİúØóäõ áóåõ İóíõÊÕóÏøóŞó Úóáóíúå»</div><br>  (The Miskin is not the person who roams around, and whose need is met by one or two dates or one or two bites. Rather, the Miskin is he who does not have what is sufficient, and to whom the people do not pay attention and, thus, do not give him from the charity.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÈúäö ÇáÓøóÈöíáö</div><br>  (and to the wayfarer) is the needy traveler who runs out of money and should, thus, be granted whatever amount that helps him to go back to his land. Such is the case with whoever intends to go on a permissible journey, he is given what he needs for his journey and back. The guests are included in this category. `Ali bin Abu Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "Ibn As-Sabil (wayfarer) is the guest who is hosted by Muslims.'' Furthermore, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Ja`far Al-Baqir, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Muqatil bin Hayyan said similarly.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóÂÆöáöíäó</div><br>  (and to those who ask) refers to those who beg people and are thus given a part of the Zakah and general charity.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİöí ÇáÑøöŞóÇÈö</div><br>  (and to set servants free) These are the servants who seek to free themselves, but cannot find enough money to buy their freedom. We will mention several of these categories and types under the Tafsir of the Ayah on Sadaqah in Surat Bara'ah chapter 9 in the Qur'an, In sha' Allah.  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóŞóÇãó ÇáÕøóáóæÉó</div><br>  (performs As-Salah (Iqamat-As-Salah)) means those who pray on time and give the prayer its due right; the bowing, prostration, and the necessary attention and humbleness required by Allah. Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóì ÇáÒøóßóæÉó</div><br>  (and gives the Zakah) means the required charity (Zakah) due on one's money, as Sa`id bin Jubayr and Muqatil bin Hayyan have stated.  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõæİõæäó ÈöÚóåúÏöåöãú ÅöĞóÇ ÚóÜåóÏõæÇú</div><br>  (and who fulfill their covenant when they make it,)  is similar to:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íõæİõæäó ÈöÚóåúÏö Çááøóåö æóáÇó íöäŞõÖõæäó ÇáúãöíËóÜŞó </div><br>  (Those who fulfill the covenant of Allah and break not the Mithaq (bond, treaty, covenant).) (13:20)  The opposite of this characteristic is hypocrisy. As found in a Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÂíóÉõ ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞö ËóáóÇËñ: ÅöĞóÇ ÍóÏøóËó ßóĞóÈó¡ æóÅĞóÇ æóÚóÏó ÃóÎúáóİó¡ æóÅĞóÇ ÇÆúÊõãöäó ÎóÇä»</div><br>  (The signs of a hypocrite are three: if he speaks, he lies; if he promises, he breaks his promise; and if he is entrusted, he breaches the trust.)  In another version:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÍóÏøóËó ßóĞóÈó¡ æóÅĞóÇ ÚóÇåóÏó ÛóÏóÑó¡æóÅĞóÇ ÎóÇÕóãó İóÌóÑ»</div><br>  (If he speaks, he lies; if he vows, he breaks his vow; and if he disputes, he is lewd.)  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÕøóÇÈöÑöíäó İöì ÇáúÈóÃúÓóÂÁö æÇáÖøóÑøóÇÁö æóÍöíäó ÇáúÈóÃúÓö</div><br>  (. ..and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles).) means, during the time of meekness and ailment.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍöíäó ÇáúÈóÃúÓö</div><br>  (...and at the time of fighting (during the battles).) means on the battlefield while facing the enemy, as Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Murrah Al-Hamdani, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak and others have stated.  And calling them the patient here, is a form of praise, because of the importance of patience in these circumstances, and the suffering and difficulties that accompany them. And Allah knows best, it is He Whom help is sought from, and upon Him we rely.  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæáóÜÆößó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÕóÏóŞõæÇ</div><br>  (Such are the people of the truth) means, whoever acquires these qualities, these are truthful in their faith. This is because they have achieved faith in the heart and realized it in deed and upon the tongue. So they are the truthful,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõæáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúãõÊøóŞõæäó</div><br>  (and they are Al-Muttaqun (the pious).) because they avoided the prohibitions and performed the acts of obedience.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ßõÊöÈó Úóáóíúßõãõ ÇáúŞöÕóÇÕõ İöí ÇáúŞóÊúáóì ÇáúÍõÑøõ ÈöÇáúÍõÑøö æóÇáúÚóÈúÏõ ÈöÇáúÚóÈúÏö æóÇáÇøòäËóì ÈöÇáÇøòäúËóì İóãóäú Úõİöìó áóåõ ãöäú ÃóÎöíåö ÔóìúÁñ İóÇÊøöÈóÇÚñ ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö æóÃóÏóÂÁñ Åöáóíúåö ÈöÅöÍúÓóÜäò Ğóáößó ÊóÎúİöíİñ ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú æóÑóÍúãóÉñ İóãóäö ÇÚúÊóÏóì ÈóÚúÏó Ğóáößó İóáóåõ ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ </div><br>  </div></body></html>
