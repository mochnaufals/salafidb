This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõã ÈöÑóÈøöåöãú áÇó íõÔúÑößõæäó </div><br>  (And those who join not anyone (in worship) as partners with their Lord;) meaning, they do not worship anyone or anything else besides Him, but they worship Him Alone and know that there is no god except Allah Alone, the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who does not take a wife or have any offspring, and there is none comparable or equal unto Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó íõÄúÊõæäó ãóÂ ÁÇÊóæÇú æøóŞõáõæÈõåõãú æóÌöáóÉñ Ãóäøóåõãú Åöáóì ÑóÈøöåöãú ÑóÌöÚõæäó </div><br>  (And those who give that which they give with their hearts full of fear, because they are sure to return to their Lord.) means, they give in charity, fearing that it may not be accepted from them because of some shortcoming or failure to meet the required conditions of giving. This has to do with fear and taking precautions, as Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah: I said: "O Messenger of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó íõÄúÊõæäó ãóÂ ÁÇÊóæÇú æøóŞõáõæÈõåõãú æóÌöáóÉñ</div><br>  (And those who give that which they give with their hearts full of fear...)  Are these the ones who steal and commit Zina and drink alcohol while fearing Allah'' The Messenger of Allah replied:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ¡ íóÇ ÈöäúÊó ÃóÈöí ÈóßúÑò íóÇ ÈöäúÊó ÇáÕøöÏøöíŞö¡ æóáóßöäøóåõ ÇáøóĞöí íõÕóáøöí æóíóÕõæãõ æóíóÊóÕóÏøóŞõ æóåõæó íóÎóÇİõ Çááåó ÚóÒøó æóÌóá»</div><br>  (No, O daughter of Abu Bakr. O daughter of As-Siddiq, the one who prays, fast and gives in charity, fearing Allah.) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded something similar in which the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóÇ ÈöäúÊó ÇáÕøöÏøöíŞö¡ æóáóßöäøóåõãõ ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÕóáøõæäó æóíóÕõæãõæäó æóíóÊóÕóÏøóŞõæäó æóåõãú íóÎóÇİõæäó ÃóáøóÇ íõŞúÈóáó ãöäúåõãú:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó íõÓóÜÑöÚõæäó İöì ÇáúÎóíúÑóÊö»</div><br>  (No, O daughter of As-Siddiq, they are the ones who pray and fast and give in charity while fearing that it will not be accepted from them, (It is these who hasten in the good deeds.)) This is also how Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Hasan Al-Basri interpreted this Ayah.  </div></body></html>
