This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÊóÑóì ÅöĞö ÇáúãõÌúÑöãõæäó äóÇßöÓõæÇú ÑõÁõæÓöåöãú ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÈúÕóÑúäóÇ æóÓóãöÚúäóÇ</div><br>  (And if you only could see when the criminals hang their heads before their Lord (saying): "Our Lord! We have now seen and heard.'') 32:12 They will say that when it will not benefit them, nor will it be of any use to them. If they had used these senses properly before seeing the torment, then it would have brought them some benefit and saved them from the Allah's punishment. This is why Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÓúãöÚú Èöåöãú æóÃóÈúÕöÑú</div><br>  (How clearly will they (disbelievers) see and hear,) This means that no one will hear and see better than they will.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÃúÊõæäóäóÇ</div><br>  (the day when they will appear before Us.) The Day of Resurrection.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÜßöäö ÇáÙøóÜáöãõæäó Çáúíóæúãó</div><br>  (But the wrongdoers today are...) now, in the life of this world,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÖóáóÜáò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (...in plain error.) They do not hear, see or think. When they are requested to follow guidance, they are not guided and they succumb to those things that do not benefit them. Then, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäúĞöÑúåõãú íóæúãó ÇáúÍóÓúÑóÉö</div><br>  (And warn them of the Day of grief and regrets,) warn the creation of the Day of Distress,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ŞõÖöìó ÇáÇøñãúÑõ</div><br>  (when the case has been decided,) when the people of Paradise and the people of Hell will be sorted out, and everyone will reach his final abode which he was destined to remain in forever.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú</div><br>  (while (now) they are) today, in the present life of this world,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÛóİúáóÉò</div><br>  (in a state of carelessness.) with the warning of the Day of grief and regret, they are heedless.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (and they believe not.) meaning they do not believe that it is true. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÏóÎóáó Ãóåúáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÇáúÌóäøóÉó æóÃóåúáõ ÇáäøóÇÑö ÇáäøóÇÑó¡ íõÌóÇÁõ ÈöÇáúãóæúÊö ßóÃóäøóåõ ßóÈúÔñ ÃóãúáóÍõ İóíõæŞóİõ Èóíúäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóÇáäøóÇÑö¡ İóíõŞóÇáõ: íóÇ Ãóåúáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö åóáú ÊóÚúÑöİõæäó åóĞóÇ¡ ŞóÇáó: İóíóÔúÑóÆöÈøõæäó æóíóäúÙõÑõæäó æóíóŞõæáõæäó:äóÚóãú åóĞóÇ ÇáúãóæúÊõ ŞóÇáó: İóíõŞóÇáõ: íóÇÃóåúáó ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ åóáú ÊóÚúÑöİõæäó åóĞóÇ¿ ŞóÇáó: İóíóÔúÑóÆöÈøõæäó æóíóäúÙõÑõæäó æóíóŞõæáõæäó: äóÚóãú åóĞóÇ ÇáúãóæúÊõ ŞóÇáó: İóíõÄúãóÑõ Èöåö İóíõĞúÈóÍõ¡ ŞóÇáó: æóíõŞóÇáõ: íóÇ Ãóåúáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ ÎõáõæÏñ æóáóÇ ãóæúÊó¡ æóíóÇ Ãóåúáó ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ ÎõáõæÏñ æóáóÇ ãóæúÊ»</div><br>  (When the people of Paradise enter Paradise and the people of the Hellfire enter the Hellfire, death will be brought in the form of a handsome ram and it will be placed between Paradise and the Hellfire. Then, it will be said, "O people of Paradise, do you know what this is'' Then, they will turn their gazes and look, and they will say, "Yes, this is death.'' Then, it will be said, "O people of the Hellfire, do you know what this is'' Then, they will turn their gazes and look, and they will say, "Yes, this is death.'' Then, the order will be given for it to be slaughtered and it will be said, "O people of Paradise, eternity and no more death, O people of Hellfire, eternity and no more death.'') Then the Messenger of Allah recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäúĞöÑúåõãú íóæúãó ÇáúÍóÓúÑóÉö ÅöĞú ŞõÖöìó ÇáÇøñãúÑõ æóåõãú İöì ÛóİúáóÉò æóåõãú áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó </div><br>  (And warn them of the Day of grief and regret, when the case has been decided, while (now) they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not.) Then, the Messenger of Allah made a gesture with his hand and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóåúáõ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ İöí ÛóİúáóÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ»</div><br>  (The people of this life are in the state of heedlessness of this life.) Thus recorded Imam Ahmad and it was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in their Sahihs with wording similar to this. It is reported from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud that he mentioned a story in which he said, "There is not a soul except that it will see a residence in Paradise and a residence in the Hellfire, and this will be the Day of distress. So the people of the Hellfire will see the residence that Allah prepared for them if they had believed. Then, it will be said to them, `If you had believed and worked righteous deeds, you would have had this, which you see in Paradise.' Then, they will be overcome with distress and grief. Likewise, the people of Paradise will see the residence that is in the Hellfire and it will be said to them, `If Allah had not bestowed His favor upon you (this would have been your place).' '' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ äóÍúäõ äóÑöËõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖó æóãóäú ÚóáóíúåóÇ æóÅöáóíúäóÇ íõÑúÌóÚõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, We will inherit the earth and whatsoever is thereon. And to Us they all shall be returned.) Allah is informing that He is the Creator, the Owner and the Controller of all matters. All of the creation will be destroyed and only He, the Most High and Most Holy, will remain. There is no one who can claim absolute ownership and control of affairs besides Him. He is the Inheritor of all His creation. He is the Eternal, Who will remain after they are gone and He is the Judge of their affairs. Therefore, no soul will be done any injustice, nor wronged even the weight of a mosquito or an atom. Ibn Abi Hatim recor- ded that Hazm bin Abi Hazm Al-Quta`i said, "`Umar bin `Abdul-Aziz wrote to `Abdul-Hamid bin `Abdur-Rahman, who was the governor of Kufah: `Thus, to proceed: Verily, Allah prescribed death for His creatures when He created them and He determined their final destination. He said in that which He revealed in His truthful Book, which He guarded with His knowledge and made His angels testify to its preservation, that He will inherit the earth and all who are on it, and they will all be returned to Him.'''  </div></body></html>
