Those who defame such of the believers who give charity voluntarily, and such who could not find to give charity except what is available to them -- so they mock at them (believers); Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and they shall have a painful torment.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Hypocrites defame Believers Who give the Little Charity They can afford</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Among the traits of the hypocrites is that they will not leave anyone without defaming and ridiculing him in all circumstances even those who give away charity. If, for instance, someone gives away a large amount, the hypocrites say that he is showing off. If someone gives away a small amount they say that Allah stands not in need of this man's charity. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Ubaydullah bin Sa`id said that Abu An-Nu`man Al-Basri said that Shu`bah narrated that Sulayman said that Abu Wa'il said that Abu Mas`ud said, "When the verses of charity were revealed, we used to work as porters. A man came and distributed objects of charity in abundance and they (hypocrites) said, `He is showing off.' Another man came and gave a Sa` (a small measure of food grains); they said, `Allah is not in need of this small amount of charity.' Then the Ayah was revealed;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íóáúãöÒõæäó ÇáúãõØøóæøöÚöíäó</div><br>  (Those who defame the volunteers...)'' Muslim collected this Hadith in the Sahih. Al-`Awfi narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, "One day, the Messenger of Allah went out to the people and called them to bring forth their charity, and they started bringing their charity. Among the last to come forth was a man who brought a Sa` of dates, saying, `O Allah's Messenger! This is a Sa` of dates. I spent the night bringing water and earned two Sa` of dates for my work. I kept one Sa` and brought you the other Sa`. ' The Messenger of Allah ordered him to add it to the charity. Some men mocked that man, saying, `Allah and His Messenger are not in need of this charity. What benefit would this Sa` of yours bring' `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf asked Allah's Messenger , `Are there any more people who give charity' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóãú íóÈúŞó ÃóÍóÏñ ÛóíúÑõß»</div><br>  (None besides you!) `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said, `I will give a hundred Uqiyah of gold as a charity.' `Umar bin Al-Khattab said to him, `Are you crazy' `Abdur-Rahman said, `I am not crazy.' `Umar said, `Have you given what you said would give' `Abdur-Rahman said, `Yes. I have eight thousand (Dirhams), four thousand I give as a loan to my Lord and four thousand I keep for myself.' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóÇÑóßó Çááåõ áóßó İöíãóÇ ÃóãúÓóßúÊó æóİöíãóÇ ÃóÚúØóíúÊ»</div><br>  (May Allah bless you for what you kept and what you gave away). However, the hypocrites defamed him, `By Allah! `Abdur-Rahman gave what he gave just to show off.' They lied, for `Abdur-Rahman willingly gave that money, and Allah revealed about his innocence and the innocence of the fellow who was poor and brought only a Sa` of dates. Allah said in His Book,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íóáúãöÒõæäó ÇáúãõØøóæøöÚöíäó ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó İöí ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÜÊö</div><br>  (Those who defame such of the believers who give charity voluntarily) 9:79.'''  A similar story was narrated from Mujahid and several others. Ibn Ishaq said, "Among the believers who gave away charity were `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf who gave four thousand Dirhams and `Asim bin `Adi from Bani `Ajlan. This occurred after the Messenger of Allah encouraged and called for paying charity. `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf stood and gave away four thousand Dirhams. `Asim bin `Adi also stood and gave a hundred Wasaq of dates, but some people defamed them, saying, `They are showing off.' As for the person who gave the little that he could afford, he was Abu `Aqil, from Bani Anif Al-Arashi, who was an ally of Bani `Amr bin `Awf. He brought a Sa` of dates and added it to the charity. They laughed at him, saying, `Allah does not need the Sa` of Abu `Aqil.''' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíóÓúÎóÑõæäó ãöäúåõãú ÓóÎöÑó Çááøóåõ ãöäúåõãú</div><br>  (so they mock at them (believers); Allah will throw back their mockery on them) rebuking them for their evil actions and defaming the believers. Truly, the reward, or punishment, is equitable to the action. Allah treated them the way mocked people are treated, to aid the believers in this life. Allah has prepared a painful torment in the Hereafter for the hypocrites, for the recompense is similar to the deed.  </div></body></html>
