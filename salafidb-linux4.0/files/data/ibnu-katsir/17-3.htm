Allah often mentions Muhammad and Musa together, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both, and he mentions the Tawrah and the Qur'an together. So after mentioning the Isra', He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóíúäóÂ ãõæÓóì ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (And We gave Musa the Scripture), meaning the Tawrah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇåõ</div><br>  (and made it), meaning the Scripture,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõÏğì</div><br>  (a guidance), meaning a guide,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöÈóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó ÃóáÇøó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú</div><br>  (for the Children of Israel (saying): "Take none...'') means, lest they should take,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä Ïõæäöì æóßöíáÇğ</div><br>  (''... other than Me as (your) Wakil'') means, `you have no protector, supporter or god besides Me,' because Allah revealed to every Prophet that he should worship Him alone with no partner or associate. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ĞõÑøöíøóÉó ãóäú ÍóãóáúäóÇ ãóÚó äõæÍò</div><br>  (O offspring of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh) by addressing the descendants of those who were carried in the ship with Nuh there is a reminder of the blessings, as if Allah is saying: `O descendants of those whom We saved and carried in the ship with Nuh, follow in the footsteps of your father,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÚóÈúÏğÇ ÔóßõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (Verily, he was a grateful servant). `Remember the blessing I have granted you by sending Muhammad.' Imam Ahmad reported that Anas bin Malik said: "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó áóíóÑúÖóì Úóäö ÇáúÚóÈúÏö Ãóäú íóÃúßõáó ÇáúÃóßúáóÉó Ãóæú íóÔúÑóÈó ÇáÔøóÑúÈóÉó İóíóÍúãóÏó Çááåó ÚóáóíúåóÇ»</div><br>  (Allah will be pleased with His servant if, when he eats something or drinks something, he praises Allah for it.)'' This was also recorded by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Malik said about Zayd bin Aslam: "He used to praise Allah in all circumstances.'' In this context, Al-Bukhari mentioned the Hadith of Abu Zar`ah narrating from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäóÇ ÓóíøöÏõ æóáóÏö ÂÏóãó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (I will be the leader of the sons of Adam on the Day of Resurrection...)  He quoted the Hadith at length, and in the Hadith, the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóíóÃúÊõæäó äõæÍğÇ İóíóŞõæáõæäó: íóÇ äõæÍõ Åöäøóßó ÃóäúÊó Ãóæøóáõ ÇáÑøõÓõáö Åöáóì Ãóåúáö ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ æóŞóÏú ÓóãøóÇßó Çááåõ ÚóÈúÏğÇ ÔóßõæÑğÇ¡ İóÇÔúİóÚú áóäóÇ Åöáóì ÑóÈøöß»</div><br>  (They will come to Nuh and will say, `O Nuh, you were the first of the Messengers sent to the people of earth, and Allah called you grateful servant, so intercede for us with your Lord.') And he quoted the Hadith in full.  </div></body></html>
