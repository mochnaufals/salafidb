And your Lord said: "Call upon Me, I will answer you.

Sufyan Ath-Thawri used to say: "O You Who love most those who ask of You, and O You Who hate most those who do not ask of You, and there is no one like that apart from You, O Lord.'' This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Similarly; the poet said: "Allah hates not to be asked, and the son of Adam hates to be asked.''  Qatadah said that Ka`b Al-Ahbar said, "This Ummah has been given three things which were not given to any nation before, only to Prophets. When Allah sent a Prophet, He said to him, `You are a witness over your nation.' But you have been made witnesses over mankind; it was said to the Prophets individually, `Allah has not laid upon you any hardship in religion,' but He said to this entire Ummah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÌóÚóáó Úóáóíúßãú İöì ÇáÏøöíäö ãöäú ÍóÑóÌò</div><br>  (and Allah has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) (22:78) and it was said to the Prophets individually; `Call upon Me, I will answer you,' but it was said to this Ummah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúÚõæäöì ÃóÓúÊóÌöÈú áóßõãú</div><br>  (Call upon Me, I will answer you).'' This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Nu`man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÏøõÚóÇÁó åõæó ÇáúÚöÈóÇÏóÉ»</div><br>  l(Indeed the supplication is the worship. )'' Then he recited,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúÚõæäöì ÃóÓúÊóÌöÈú áóßõãú Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÓúÊóßúÈöÑõæäó Úóäú ÚöÈóÇÏóÊöì ÓóíóÏúÎõáõæäó Ìóåóäøóãó ÏóÎöÑöíäó</div><br>  (And your Lord said: "Call upon Me, I will answer you. Verily, those who scorn My worship they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!''). This was also recorded by the Sunan compilers; At-Tirmdhi, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih.'' It was also recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Jarir with a different chain of narration. Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÓúÊóßúÈöÑõæäó Úóäú ÚöÈóÇÏóÊöì</div><br>  (Verily, those who scorn My worship) means, `those who are too proud to call on Me and single Me out,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóíóÏúÎõáõæäó Ìóåóäøóãó ÏóÎöÑöíäó</div><br>  (they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) means, in disgrace and insignificance. Imam Ahmad recorded from `Amr bin Shu`ayb from his father, from his grandfather that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÍúÔóÑõ ÇáúãõÊóßóÈøöÑõæäó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÃóãúËóÇáó ÇáĞøóÑøö İöí ÕõæóÑö ÇáäøóÇÓö¡ íóÚúáõæåõãú ßõáøõ ÔóíúÁò ãöäó ÇáÕøóÛóÇÑö¡ ÍóÊúì íóÏúÎõáõæÇ ÓöÌúäğÇ İöí Ìóåóäøóãó íõŞóÇáõ áóåõ: ÈõæáóÓõ¡ ÊóÚúáõæåõãú äóÇÑõ ÇáúÃäúíóÇÑö¡ íõÓúŞóæúäó ãöäú ØöíäóÉö ÇáúÎóÈóÇáö¡ ÚõÕóÇÑóÉö Ãóåúáö ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (The proud will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection like ants in the image of people, and everything will be stepping on them, humiliating them, until they enter a prison in Hell called Bulas. They will be fed flames of fire, and given for drink a paste of insanity dripping from the people the Fire.)''  </div></body></html>
