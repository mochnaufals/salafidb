Men go to battle, but we do not go to battle, and we earn one-half of the inheritance (that men get).'' Allah sent down,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÊóãóäøóæúÇú ãóÇ İóÖøóáó Çááøóåõ Èöåö ÈóÚúÖóßõãú Úóáóì ÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (And wish not for the things in which Allah has made some of you to excel others). At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöáÑøöÌóÇáö äóÕöíÈñ ãøöãøóÇ ÇßúÊóÓóÈõæÇú æóáöáäøöÓóÂÁö äóÕöíÈñ ãøöãøóÇ ÇßúÊóÓóÈúäó</div><br>  (For men there is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is reward for what they have earned,) indicates, according to Ibn Jarir, that each person will earn his wages for his works, a reward if his deeds are good, and punishment if his deeds are evil. It was also reported that this Ayah is talking about inheritance, indicating the fact that each person will get his due share of the inheritance, as Al-Walibi reported from Ibn `Abbas. Allah then directed the servants to what benefits them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúÃóáõæÇú Çááøóåó ãöä İóÖúáöåö</div><br>  (and ask Allah of His Bounty.)Therefore, the Ayah states, "Do not wish for what other people were endowed with over you, for this is a decision that will come to pass, and wishing does not change its decree. However, ask Me of My favor and I will grant it to you, for I Am Most Generous and Most Giving.'' Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ßóÇäó Èößõáøö ÔóìúÁò ÚóáöíãÇğ</div><br>  (Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything.) meaning, Allah knows who deserves this life, and so He gives him riches, and whoever deserves poverty, He makes him poor. He also knows who deserves the Hereafter, and He directs him to perform the deeds that will help him to be sucessful in it, and whoever deserves failure, He prevents him from achieving righteousness and what leads to it. Hence, Allah said, m   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ßóÇäó Èößõáøö ÔóìúÁò ÚóáöíãÇğ</div><br>  (Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything).  </div></body></html>
