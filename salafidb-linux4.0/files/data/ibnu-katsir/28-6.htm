Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöÑúÚóæúäó ÚóáÇó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Verily, Fir`awn exalted himself in the land) means, he was an arrogant oppressor and tyrant.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáó ÃóåúáóåóÇ ÔöíóÚÇğ</div><br>  (and made its people Shiya`) means, he made them into different classes, each of which he used to do whatever he wanted of the affairs of his state.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÊóÖúÚöİõ ØóÂÆöİóÉğ ãøöäúåõãú</div><br>  (weakening a group among them. ) This refers to the Children of Israel, who at that time were the best of people, even though this tyrant king overpowered them, using them to do the most menial work and forcing them to hard labor night and day for him and his people. At the same time, he was killing their sons and letting their daughters live, to humiliate them and because he feared that there might appear among them the boy who would be the cause of his destruction and the downfall of his kingdom. So Fir`awn took precautions against that happening, by ordering that all boys born to the Children of Israel should be killed, but this precaution did not protect him against the divine decree, because when the term of Allah comes, it cannot be delayed, and for each and every matter there is a decree from Allah. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõÑöíÏõ Ãóä äøóãõäøó Úóáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÓúÊõÖúÚöİõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak in the land,) until His saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÍúĞóÑõæäó</div><br>  (which they feared.) And Allah did indeed do this to them, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóæúÑóËúäóÇ ÇáúŞóæúãó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóÇäõæÇú íõÓúÊóÖúÚóİõæäó</div><br>  (And We made the people who were considered weak) until His saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚúÑöÔõæäó</div><br>  (they erected) (7:137). And Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó æóÃóæúÑóËúäóÜåóÇ Èóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó </div><br>  (Thus and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them) (26: 59). Fir`awn hoped that by his strength and power he would be saved from Musa, but that did not help him in the slightest. Despite his great power as a king he could not oppose the decree of Allah, which can never be overcome. On the contrary, Allah's ruling was carried out, for it had been written and decreed from past eternity that Fir`awn would meet his doom at the hands of Musa.  </div></body></html>
