This prohibition could be only that of decree, meaning that Allah allowed the Jews to falsely interpret their Book and change and alter the information about what was allowed for them. They thus, out of exaggeration and extremism in the religion, prohibited some things for themselves. It could also mean that in the Tawrah, Allah prohibited things that were allowed for them before. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøõ ÇáØøóÚóÇãö ßóÇäó ÍöÜáÇøğ áøöÈóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ÍóÑøóãó ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáõ Úóáóì äóİúÓöåö ãöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä ÊõäóÒøóáó ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉõ</div><br>  (All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Isra'il made unlawful for himself before the Tawrah was revealed.) We mentioned this Ayah before, which means that all types of food were allowed for the Children of Israel before the Tawrah was revealed, except the camel's meat and milk that Isra'il prohibited for himself. Later, Allah prohibited many things in the Tawrah. Allah said in Surat Al-An`am (chapter 6),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú ÍóÑøóãúäóÇ ßõáøó Ğöì ÙõİõÑò æóãöäó ÇáúÈóŞóÑö æóÇáúÛóäóãö ÍóÑøóãúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ÔõÍõæãóåõãóÂ ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ÍóãóáóÊú ÙõåõæÑõåõãóÂ Ãóæö ÇáúÍóæóÇíóÂ Ãóæú ãóÇ ÇÎúÊóáóØó ÈöÚóÙúãò Ğóáößó ÌóÒóíúäóÜåõã ÈöÈóÛúíöåöãú æöÅöäøóÇ áóÕóÜÏöŞõæäó </div><br>  (And unto those who are Jews, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their backs or their entrails, or is mixed up with a bone. Thus We recompensed them for their rebellion. And verily, We are Truthful.) This means, We prohibited these things for them because they deserved it due to their transgression, injustice, defying their Messenger and disputing with him. So Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöÙõáúãò ãøöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú ÍóÑøóãúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ØóíøöÈóÜÊò ÃõÍöáøóÊú áóåõãú æóÈöÕóÏøöåöãú Úóä ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö ßóËöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful to them certain good foods which had been lawful to them, and for their hindering many from Allah's way.) This Ayah states that they hindered themselves and others from following the truth, and this is the behavior that they brought from the past to the present. This is why they were and still are the enemies of the Messengers, killing many of the Prophets. They also denied Muhammad and `Isa, peace be upon them. mAllah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÎúĞöåöãõ ÇáÑøöÈóÇ æóŞóÏú äõåõæÇú Úóäúåõ</div><br>  (And their taking of Riba' though they were forbidden from taking it,)  Allah prohibited them from taking Riba', yet they did so using various kinds of tricks, ploys and cons, thus devouring people's property unjustly.

We mentioned this subject when we explained Surah Al `Imran (3). The Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (and the believers...) refers to the well-grounded in knowledge;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúßó æóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó ãöä ŞóÈúáößó</div><br>  (believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you;)  Ibn `Abbas said, "This Ayah was revealed concerning `Abdullah bin Salam, Tha`labah bin Sa`yah, Zayd bin Sa`yah and Asad bin `Ubayd who embraced Islam and believed what Allah sent Muhammad with. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõÄúÊõæäó ÇáÒøóßóæÉó</div><br>  (and give Zakah,) This could be referring to the obligatory charity due on one's wealth and property, or those who purify themselves, or both.
