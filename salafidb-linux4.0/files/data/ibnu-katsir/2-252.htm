So they routed them by Allah's leave and Dawud (David) killed Jalut (Goliath), and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom after the death of Talut and Samuel and Al-Hikmah (prophethood), and taught him of that which He willed. And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allah is full of bounty to the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists).) (252. These are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of Allah.)</div>  When the faithful party, who were few under the command of Talut, faced their enemy, who were many under the command of Jalut,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóİúÑöÛú ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÕóÈúÑğÇ</div><br>  (they invoked: "Our Lord!

Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóÒóãõæåõã ÈöÅöĞúäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (So they routed them by Allah's leave) meaning, they defeated and overwhelmed them by Allah's aid and support. Then,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÊóáó ÏóÇæõæÏõ ÌóÇáõæÊó</div><br>  (and Dawud killed Jalut)  Israelite accounts claimed that (Prophet) David killed Goliath with a slingshot that he had, which he launched at Goliath causing his death.  Talut promised that whoever killed Jalut, would marry his daughter and would share his kingship and authority. He kept his promise. Later, the kingship was transferred to Prophet Dawud in addition to being granted Prophethood by Allah. So, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÂÊóÜåõ Çááøóåõ Çáúãõáúßó</div><br>  (...and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom) that Talut had and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÍößúÜÜãóÉö</div><br>  (and Al-Hikmah) that comes with the prophethood, meaning, after Shamwil. Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóáøóãóåõ ãöãøóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (and taught him of that which He willed.) meaning, what He willed of the knowledge that He bestowed on (Prophet) Dawud.  Next, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæúáÇó ÏóİúÚõ Çááøóåö ÇáäøóÇÓó ÈóÚúÖóåõã ÈöÈóÚúÖò áóİóÓóÏóÊö ÇáÃóÑúÖõ</div><br>  (And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief.)  This Ayah indicates that if it were not for the fact that Allah checks one set of people with another, such as when Talut and the bravery of Dawud helped the Children of Israel (against Goliath), then people would have perished. Similarly, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæúáÇó ÏóİúÚõ Çááøóåö ÇáäøóÇÓó ÈóÚúÖóåõãú ÈöÈóÚúÖò áøóåõÏøöãóÊú ÕóæóãöÚõ æóÈöíóÚñ æóÕóáóæóÊñ æóãóÓóÜÌöÏõ íõĞúßóÑõ İöíåóÇ ÇÓãõ Çááøóåö ßóËöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (For had it not been that Allah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and Masjids, wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned much, would surely, have been pulled down.) (22:40)  Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöäøó Çááøóåó Ğõæ İóÖúáò Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (But Allah is full of bounty to the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists)) meaning, by His mercy and favor He fixes some of them by some others. Surely, Allah has the wisdom, the supreme authority and the clear proof against His creation in all of His actions and statements.  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÂíóÜÊõ Çááøóåö äóÊúáõæåóÇ Úóáóíúßó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö æóÅöäøóßó áóãöäó ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíäó </div><br>  (These are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of Allah).)  This Ayah states, `These Ayat (verses) of Allah that We have narrated for you in truth conform to the exact manner that these stories have occurred and to the truth that still remain in the (Divine) Books that the scholars of the Children of Israel have and know. Allah said: O Muhammad,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóßó</div><br>  (you are)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóãöäó ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíäó</div><br>  (one of the Messengers (of Allah)) emphatically stating the truth of his prophethood  </div></body></html>
