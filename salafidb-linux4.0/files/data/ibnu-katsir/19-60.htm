This means later generations.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÖóÇÚõæÇú ÇáÕøóáóÜæÉó</div><br>  (who have lost Salah) Losing their prayers is when they do not consider the prayers obligatory. Therefore they lose, because the prayer is the pillar and foundation of the religion. It is the best of the servants' deeds. Thus, these people will occupy themselves with worldly desires and delights, and they will be pleased with the life of this world. They will be tranquil and at ease in the worldly appetites. Therefore, these people will meet with Ghaiy, which means loss on the Day of Resurrection. Al-Awza`i reported from Musa bin Sulayman, who reported from Al-Qasim bin Mukhaymirah that he said concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÎóáóİó ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåöãú Îóáúİñ ÃóÖóÇÚõæÇú ÇáÕøóáóÜæÉó</div><br>  (Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have lost the Salah) "This means that they will not keep up with the proper times of the prayer, because if it meant complete abandonment of the prayer, this would be disbelief.'' It is also reported that it was said to Ibn Mas`ud, "Allah often mentions the prayer in the Qur'an. He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú Úóä ÕóáóÜÊöåöãú ÓóÇåõæäó </div><br>  (Those who neglect their Salah.) 107:5 And He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóì ÕóáÇóÊöåöãú ÏóÂÆöãõæäó</div><br>  (Those who remain constant in their Salah.) 70:23 And He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóì ÕóáÇóÊöåöãú íõÍóÇİöÙõæäó</div><br>  (Who guard their Salah.)'' 23:9 Then, Ibn Mas`ud said, "This means at its designated times.'' The people said, "We thought that this was referring to the abandonment of the prayer.'' He replied, "That would be disbelief.'' Masruq said, "No one who guards the five daily prayers will be written among the heedless. In their neglect is destruction. Their neglect is delaying them past their fixed times.'' Al-Awza`i reported from Ibrahim bin Zayd that Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÎóáóİó ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåöãú Îóáúİñ ÃóÖóÇÚõæÇú ÇáÕøóáóÜæÉó æóÇÊøóÈóÚõæÇú ÇáÔøóåóæóÊö İóÓóæúİó íóáúŞõæäó ÛóíøÇğ </div><br>  (Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have lost the Salah and have followed lusts. So they will meet Ghayy.) Then, he said, "Their loss was not their abandonment of the prayers, but it was by not offering them during their proper and prescribed times.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó íóáúŞõæäó ÛóíøÇğ</div><br>  (So they will meet Ghayy. ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó íóáúŞõæäó ÛóíøÇğ</div><br>  (So they will meet Ghayy.) "This means loss.'' Qatadah said, "This means evil.'' Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah and Muhammad bin Ishaq all reported from Abu Ishaq As-Sabi`i, who reported from Abu `Ubaydah, who reported from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó íóáúŞõæäó ÛóíøÇğ</div><br>  (So they will meet Ghayy.) "This is a valley in the Hellfire which is very deep and its food is filthy.'' Al-A`mash reported from Ziyad, who reported from Abu `Iyad, who commented Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó íóáúŞõæäó ÛóíøÇğ</div><br>  (So they will meet Ghayy.) He said, "This is a valley in Hell made of puss and blood.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóä ÊóÇÈó æóÁóÇãóäó æóÚóãöáó ÕóÜáöÍÇğ</div><br>  (Except those who repent and believe and work righteousness.) This means, "Except those who recant from giving up the prayers and following the desires, for verily, Allah will accept their repentance, give them a good end and make them of those who inherit the Garden of Delight (Paradise). '' For this reason Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó íóÏúÎõáõæäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó æóáÇó íõÙúáóãõæäó ÔóíúÆÇğ</div><br>  (Such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in aught.) This is because repentance wipes away that which was before it. In another Hadith, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÊøóÇÆöÈõ ãöäó ÇáĞøóäúÈö ßóãóäú áóÇĞóäúÈó áóå»</div><br>  (The one who repents from sin is like he who has no sin.) Because of this, those who repent will not lose anything from the (good) deeds that they did. They will not be held accountable for what they did before their repentance, thus causing a decrease in their reward for deeds that they do after their repentance. That is because whatever they did before repenting is lost, forgotten and not taken to account. This is an honor from the Most Generous and a kindness from the Most Gentle. This is an exception that is made for these people, similar to Allah's statement in Surah Al-Furqan,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÏúÚõæäó ãóÚó Çááøóåö ÅöáóÜåóÇ ÁóÇÎóÑó æóáÇó íóŞúÊõáõæäó ÇáäøóİúÓó ÇáøóÊöì ÍóÑøóãó Çááøóåõ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause...) until Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑÇğ ÑøóÍöíãÇğ</div><br>  (and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) 25:68-70  </div></body></html>
