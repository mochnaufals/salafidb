Khusayf reported from Mujahid;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÃõŞúÓöãõ ÈöåóÜĞóÇ ÇáúÈóáóÏö </div><br>  (Nay! I swear by this city;) "The word "La'' (Nay) refers to the refutation against them (Quraish). I swear by this city.'' Shabib bin Bishr narrated from `Ikrimah, from Ibn `Abbas that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÃõŞúÓöãõ ÈöåóÜĞóÇ ÇáúÈóáóÏö </div><br>  (Nay! I swear by this city;) "This means Makkah.'' Concerning the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÊó Íöáøñ ÈöåóÜĞóÇ ÇáúÈóáóÏö </div><br>  (And you are free in this city.) he (Ibn `Abbas) said, "O Muhammad! It is permissable for you to fight in it.'' Similar was reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Salih, `Atiyah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "Allah made it lawful (to fight in) for him (the Prophet ) for one hour of a day.'' The meaning of what they have said was mentioned in a Hadith that is agreed- upon as being authentic. In it the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó åóĞóÇ ÇáúÈóáóÏó ÍóÑøóãóåõ Çááåõ íóæúãó ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãæóÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖó¡ İóåõæó ÍóÑóÇãñ ÈöÍõÑúãóÉö Çááåö Åöáóì íóæúã ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö áóÇ íõÚúÖóÏõ ÔóÌóÑõåõ æóáóÇ íõÎúÊóáóì ÎóáóÇåõ¡ æóÅöäøóãóÇ ÃõÍöáøóÊú áöí ÓóÇÚóÉñ ãöäú äóåóÇÑò¡ æóŞóÏú ÚóÇÏóÊú ÍõÑúãóÊõåóÇ Çáúíóæúãó ßóÍõÑúãóÊöåóÇ ÈöÇáúÃóãúÓö¡ ÃóáóÇ İóáúíõÈóáøöÛö ÇáÔøóÇåöÏõ ÇáúÛóÇÆöÈ»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah made this city sacred on the Day that He created the heavens and the earth. Therefore, it is sacred by the sanctity of Allah until the Day of Judgement. Its trees should not be uprooted, and its bushes and grasses should not be removed. And it was only made lawful for me (to fight in) for one hour of a day. Today its sanctity has been restored just as it was sacred yesterday. So, let the one who is present inform those who are absent.) In another wording of this Hadith, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöäú ÃóÍóÏñ ÊóÑóÎøóÕó ÈöŞöÊóÇáö ÑóÓõæáö Çááåö İóŞõæáõæÇ: Åöäøó Çááåó ÃóĞöäó áöÑóÓõæáöåö æóáóãú íóÃúĞóäú áóßõã»</div><br>  (So, if anyone tries to use the fighting of the Messenger (to conquer Makkah) as an excuse (to fight there), then tell him that Allah permitted it for His Messenger and He has not permitted it for you.) Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóÇáöÏò æóãóÇ æóáóÏó </div><br>  (And by the begetter and that which he begot.) Mujahid, Abu Salih, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Khusayf, Shurahbil bin Sa`d and others have said, "Meaning, by the begetter, Adam, and that which he begot is his children.'' This view that Mujahid and his companions have chosen is good and strong. This is supported by the fact that Allah swears by the Mother of the Towns, which are dwellings. Then after it He swears by the dwellers therein, who is Adam, the father of mankind, and his children. Abu `Imran Al-Jawni said, "It refers to Ibrahim and his progeny.'' Ibn Jarir recorded this statement as did Ibn Abi Hatim. Ibn Jarir preferred the view that it is general and it refers to every father and his children. This meaning is also acceptable. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó İöì ßóÈóÏò </div><br>  (Verily, We have created man in Kabad.) Ibn Abi Najih and Jurayj reported from `Ata, from Ibn `Abbas concerning the phrase `in Kabad', "He was created while in hardship. Don't you see him'' Then he mentioned his birth and the sprouting of his teeth. Mujahid said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ßóÈóÏò</div><br>  (in Kabad.) "A drop of sperm, then a clot, then a lump of flesh, enduring in his creation.'' Mujahid then said, "This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóãóáóÊúåõ Ãõãøõåõ ßõÑúåÇğ æóæóÖóÚóÊúåõ ßõÑúåÇğ</div><br>  (His mother bears him with hardship. And she brings him forth with hardship.) (46:15) and she breast-feeds him with hardship, and his livelihood is a hardship. So he endures all of this.'' Sa`id bin Jubayr said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó İöì ßóÈóÏò </div><br>  (Verily, We have created man in Kabad.) "In hardship and seeking livelihood.'' `Ikrimah said, "In hardship and long-suffering.'' Qatadah said, "In difficulty.'' It is reported from Al-Hasan that he said, "Enduring the hardships of the world by life and the severity of the Hereafter.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Man is encompassed by Allah and His Bounties</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíóÍúÓóÈõ Ãóä áøóä íóŞúÏöÑó Úóáóíúåö ÃóÍóÏñ </div><br>  (Does he think that none can overcome him) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíóÍúÓóÈõ Ãóä áøóä íóŞúÏöÑó Úóáóíúåö ÃóÍóÏñ </div><br>  (Does he think that none can overcome him) "Meaning no one is able to take his wealth.'' Qatadah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíóÍúÓóÈõ Ãóä áøóä íóŞúÏöÑó Úóáóíúåö ÃóÍóÏñ </div><br>  (Does he think that none can overcome him) "The Son of Adam thinks that he will not be asked about this wealth of his -- how he earned and how he spent it.'' Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõ ÃóåúáóßúÊõ ãóÇáÇğ áøõÈóÏÇğ </div><br>  (He says: "I have wasted wealth in abundance!'') This means, the Son of Adam says, "I spent an abundance of wealth.'' Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others have said this.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíóÍúÓóÈõ Ãóä áøóãú íóÑóåõ ÃóÍóÏñ </div><br>  (Does he think that none sees him) Mujahid said, "Does he think that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, does not see him.'' Others among the Salaf have said similar to this. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú äóÌúÚóá áøóåõ Úóíúäóíúäö </div><br>  (Have We not made for him two eyes) meaning, for him to see with them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöÓóÇäÇğ</div><br>  (And a tongue) meaning, for him to speak with, and so that he can express that which is inside of him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÔóİóÊóíúäö</div><br>  (and two lips) In order to help him with speaking, eating food, and beautifying his face and his mouth. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Ability to distinguish between Good and Evil is also a Blessing</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóÏóíúäóÜåõ ÇáäøóÌúÏóíäö </div><br>  (And shown him the two ways) This refers to the two paths. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from `Asim, from Zirr, from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóÏóíúäóÜåõ ÇáäøóÌúÏóíäö </div><br>  (And shown him the two ways) "The good and the evil.'' Similar to this has been reported from `Ali, Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Wa'il, Abu Salih, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, and `Ata' Al-Khurasani among others. Similar to this Ayah is Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ãöä äøõØúİóÉò ÃóãúÔóÇÌò äøóÈúÊóáöíåö İóÌóÚóáúäóÜåõ ÓóãöíÚÇğ ÈóÕöíÑÇğ - ÅöäøóÇ åóÏóíúäóÜåõ ÇáÓøóÈöíáó ÅöãøóÇ ÔóÇßöÑÇğ æóÅöãøóÇ ßóİõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (Verily, We have created man from Nutfah Amshaj, in order to try him: so We made him hearer and seer.
