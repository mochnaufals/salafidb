And Allah has made shade for you out of that which He has created, and He has made places of refuge in the mountains for you, and He has made garments for you to protect you from the heat, and coats of mail to protect you from your violence.

He has also given them homes from the hides of cattle, i.e., leather, which are light and easy to carry on journeys and can be erected wherever they stop, whether they are traveling or are settled. Thus Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÓúÊóÎöİøõæäóåóÇ íóæúãó ÙóÚúäößõãú æóíóæúãó ÅöŞóÜãóÊößõãú</div><br>  (which you find so light when you travel and when you camp;)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäú ÃóÕúæóÇİöåóÇ æóÃóæúÈóÇÑöåóÇ æóÃóÔúÚóÇÑöåóÂ</div><br>  (out of their wool, fur and hair) refers to sheep, camels and goats respectively.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóËóÜËÇğ</div><br>  (furnishings) meaning what you take from them, i.e., wealth. It was also said that it means articles of convenience, or clothing. The correct view is more general in meaning than this; it means that you make carpets, clothing and other things from their wool, hair etc., which you use as wealth and for trade. Ibn `Abbas said: `Al-Athath means articles of convenience and comfort.'' This was also the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah. The phrase,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì Íöíäò</div><br>  (for a while) means, until the appointed time. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Shade, Places of Refuge in the Mountains, Garments and Coats of Mail are also Blessings from Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÌóÚóáó áóßõãú ãøöãøóÇ ÎóáóŞó ÙöáóÜáÇğ</div><br>  (And Allah has made shade for you out of that which He has created,) Qatadah said: "This means trees.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáó áóßõãú ãøöäó ÇáúÌöÈóÇáö ÃóßúäóÜäÇğ</div><br>  (and He has made places of refuge in the mountains for you,) meaning fortresses and strongholds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌóÚóáó áóßõãõÓóÑóÇÈöíáó ÊóŞöíßõãõ ÇáúÍóÑøó</div><br>  (and He has made garments for you to protect you from the heat,) meaning clothing of cotton, linen and wool.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÑóÈöíáó ÊóŞöíßõã ÈóÃúÓóßõãú</div><br>  (and coats of mail to protect you from your violence.) such as shields made of layers of sheet iron, coats of mail and so on.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó íõÊöãøõ äöÚúãóÊóåõ Úóáóíúßõãú</div><br>  (Thus does He perfect His favor for you,) meaning, thus He gives you what you need to go about your business, so that this will help you to worship and obey Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊõÓúáöãõæäó</div><br>  (that you may submit yourselves to His will).
