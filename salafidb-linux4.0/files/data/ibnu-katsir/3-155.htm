In this case, slumber is a favor and carries meanings of calmness and safety. For instance, Allah said in Surat Al-Anfal about the battle of Badr,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú íõÛóÔøöíßõãõ ÇáäøõÚóÇÓó ÃóãóäóÉğ ãøöäúåõ</div><br>  ((Remember) when He covered you with a slumber as a security from Him) 8:11.  Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas said that, Abu Talhah said, "I was among those who were overcome by slumber during the battle of Uhud. My sword fell from my hand several times and I would pick it up, then it would fall and I would pick it up again.'' Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith in the stories of the battles without a chain of narration, and in the book of Tafsir with a chain of narrators. At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Al-Hakim recorded from Anas that Abu Talhah said, "On the day of Uhud, I raised my head and looked around and found that everyone's head was nodding from slumber.'' This is the wording of At-Tirmidhi, who said, "Hasan Sahih''. An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith from Anas who said that Abu Talhah said, "I was among those who were overcome by slumber.''  The second group mentioned in the Ayah were the hypocrites who only thought about themselves, for they are the most cowardly people and those least likely to support the truth,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÙõäøõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö ÛóíúÑó ÇáúÍóŞøö Ùóäøó ÇáúÌóÜåöáöíøóÉö</div><br>  (and thought wrongly of Allah - the thought of ignorance) 3:154, for they are liars and people who have doubts and evil thoughts about Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÃóäÒóáó Úóáóíúßõãú ãøöä ÈóÚúÏö ÇáúÛóãøö ÃóãóäóÉğ äøõÚóÇÓÇğ íóÛúÔóì ØóÂÆöİóÉğ ãøöäúßõãú</div><br>  (Then after the distress, He sent down security for you. Slumber overtook a party of you), the people of faith, certainty, firmness and reliance (on Allah) who are certain that Allah shall give victory to His Messenger and fulfill his objective.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóØóÂÆöİóÉñ ŞóÏú ÃóåóãøóÊúåõãú ÃóäúİõÓõåõãú</div><br>  (While another party was thinking about themselves), and they were not overcome by slumber because of their worry, fright and fear,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÙõäøõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö ÛóíúÑó ÇáúÍóŞøö Ùóäøó ÇáúÌóÜåöáöíøóÉö</div><br>  (and thought wrongly of Allah --- the thought of ignorance).  Similarly, Allah said in another statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ÙóäóäúÊõãú Ãóä áøóä íóäŞóáöÈó ÇáÑøóÓõæáõ æóÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó Åöáóì Ãóåúáöíåöãú ÃóÈóÏÇğ</div><br>  (Nay, but you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families) 48:12.  This group thought that the idolators achieved ultimate victory, when their forces took the upper hand in battle, and that Islam and its people would perish. This is typical of people of doubt and hesitation, in the event of a hardship, they fall into such evil thoughts. Allah then described them that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõæäó</div><br>  (they said) in this situation,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóá áøóäóÇ ãöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö ãöä ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  ("Have we any part in the affair'') Allah replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Åöäøó ÇáÇøñãúÑó ßõáøóåõ ááøóåö íõÎúİõæäó İöì ÃóäúİõÓöåöã ãøóÇ áÇó íõÈúÏõæäó áóßó</div><br>  (Say: "Indeed the affair belongs wholly to Allah.''

Ibn Ishaq recorded that `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr said that Az-Zubayr said, "I was with the Messenger of Allah when fear intensified and Allah sent sleep to us (during the battle of Uhud). At that time, every man among us (except the hypocrites) was nodding off. By Allah! As if in a dream, I heard the words of Mu`attib bin Qushayr, `If we had anything to do with the affair, none of us would have been killed here.' I memorized these words of his, which Allah mentioned later on,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõæäó áóæú ßóÇäó áóäóÇ ãöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö ÔóìúÁñ ãøóÇ ŞõÊöáúäóÇ åóÜåõäóÇ</div><br>  (saying: "If we had anything to do with the affair, none of us would have been killed here.)''  Ibn Abi Hatim collected this Hadith.  Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõá áøóæú ßõäÊõãú İöì ÈõíõæÊößõãú áóÈóÑóÒó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßõÊöÈó Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáúŞóÊúáõ Åöáóì ãóÖóÇÌöÚöåöãú</div><br>  (Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death,'') meaning, this is Allah's appointed destiny and a decision that will certainly come to pass, and there is no escaping it. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöíóÈúÊóáöìó Çááøóåõ ãóÇ İöì ÕõÏõæÑößõãú æóáöíõãóÍøöÕó ãóÇ İöì ŞõáõæÈößõãú</div><br>  (that Allah might test what is in your breasts; and to purify that which was in your hearts,) means, so that He tests you with whatever befell you, to distinguish good from evil and the deeds and statements of the believers from those of the hypocrites,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ Úóáöíãñ ÈöĞóÇÊö ÇáÕøõÏõæÑö</div><br>  (and Allah is All-Knower of what is in the breasts), and what the hearts conceal. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Some of the Believers Give Flight on the Day of Uhud</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóæóáøóæúÇú ãöäßõãú íóæúãó ÇáúÊóŞóì ÇáúÌóãúÚóÇäö ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇÓúÊóÒóáøóåõãõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ ÈöÈóÚúÖö ãóÇ ßóÓóÈõæÇú</div><br>  (Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met, Shaytan only caused them to err because of some of what they had earned) 3:155,  because of some of their previous errors. Indeed, some of the Salaf said, "The reward of the good deed includes being directed to another good deed that follows it, while the retribution of sin includes committing another sin that follows it.'' Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÚóİóÇ Çááøóåõ Úóäúåõãú</div><br>  (but Allah, indeed, has forgiven them), their giving flight,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ Íóáöíãñ</div><br>  (surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing)  He forgives sins, pardons and exonerates His creatures. Imam Ahmad recorded that Shaqiq said, " `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf met Al-Walid bin `Uqbah, who said to him, `Why did you desert `Uthman, the Leader of the Faithful' `Abdur-Rahman said, `Tell him that I did not run away during Uhud, remain behind during Badr, nor abandon the Sunnah of `Umar.' Al-Walid told `Uthman what `Abdur-Rahman said. `Uthman replied, `As for his statement, `I did not run away during Uhud,' how can he blame me for an error that Allah has already forgiven. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóæóáøóæúÇú ãöäßõãú íóæúãó ÇáúÊóŞóì ÇáúÌóãúÚóÇäö ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇÓúÊóÒóáøóåõãõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ ÈöÈóÚúÖö ãóÇ ßóÓóÈõæÇú æóáóŞóÏú ÚóİóÇ Çááøóåõ Úóäúåõãú</div><br>  (Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met, Shaytan only caused them to err because of some of what they had earned. But Allah, indeed, has forgiven them).  As for his statement that I remained behind from participating in Badr, I was nursing Ruqayyah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah , until she passed away. The Messenger of Allah gave me a share in the booty of Badr, and whoever gets a share in the booty from the Messenger of Allah will have participated in battle. As for his statement that I abandoned the Sunnah of `Umar, neither I nor he are able to endure it. Go and convey this answer to him.'''  </div></body></html>
