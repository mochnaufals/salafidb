So he must treat them with the utmost kindness and respect, his father for spending on him and his mother because of her compassion for him.

And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them, but address them in terms of honor. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: "My Lord! Bestow on them Your mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.'') (17:23-24) Although Allah orders us to show kindness, mercy and respect towards them in return for their previous kindness, He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÌóÜåóÏóÇßó áöÊõÔúÑößó Èöì ãóÇ áóíúÓó áóßó Èöåö Úöáúãñ İóáÇó ÊõØöÚúåõãóÂ</div><br>  (but if they strive to make associate with Me, which you have no knowledge of, then obey them not.) meaning, if they are idolators, and they try to make you follow them in their religion, then beware of them, and do not obey them in that, for you will be brought back to Me on the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will reward you for your kindness towards them and your patience in adhering to your religion. It is Allah Who will gather you with the group of the righteous, not with the group of your parents, even though you were the closest of people to them in the world. For a person will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection with those whom he loves, meaning, religious love.

In his Tafsir of this Ayah, At-Tirmidhi recorded that Sa`d said: "Four Ayat were revealed concerning me -- and he told his story. He said: "Umm Sa`d said: `Did Allah not command you to honor your parents By Allah, I will not eat or drink anything until I die or you renounce Islam.' When they wanted to feed her, they would force her mouth open. Then this Ayah was revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóÕøóíúäóÇ ÇáÅöäúÓóÜäó ÈöæóÇáöÏóíúåö ÍõÓúäÇğ æóÅöä ÌóÜåóÏóÇßó áöÊõÔúÑößó Èöì ãóÇ áóíúÓó áóßó Èöåö Úöáúãñ İóáÇó ÊõØöÚúåõãóÂ</div><br>  (And We have enjoined on man to be dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you associate with Me, of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not.)''
