The Zani marries not but a Zaniyah or a Mushrikah; and the Zaniyah, none marries her except a Zani or a Mushrik. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers.) Here Allah tells us that the Zani (male who is guilty of illegal sex) does not have intercourse except with a Zaniyah (female who is guilty of illegal sex) or a Mushrikah (female idolator), meaning that no one would go along with him in this action except a sinful woman who is also guilty of Zina, or a Mushrikah who does not think it is unlawful.

Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan said: "Allah forbade the believers from marrying prostitutes.'' This Ayah is like the Ayah (about marrying slave-girls):   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÍúÕóäóÜÊ ÛóíúÑó ãõÓóÜİöÍóÜÊò æóáÇó ãõÊøóÎöĞóÇÊö ÃóÎúÏóÇäò</div><br>  (they should be chaste, not committing illegal sex, nor taking boyfriends.) 4:25 And His saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÍúÕöäöíäó ÛóíúÑó ãõÓóÇİöÍöíäó æóáÇó ãõÊøóÎöĞöì ÃóÎúÏóÇäò</div><br>  (desiring chastity not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends) 5:5. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said that a man among the believers asked the Messenger of Allah for permission (to marry) a woman known as Umm Mahzul, who used to commit adultery, and who had stated the condition that she should spend on him. So he asked the Messenger of Allah for permission, or he mentioned the matter to him. The Messenger of Allah recited to him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÒøóÇäöì áÇó íóäßöÍõ ÅöáÇøó ÒóÇäöíóÉğ Ãóæú ãõÔúÑößóÉğ æóÇáÒøóÇäöíóÉõ áÇó íóäßöÍõåóÂ ÅöáÇøó ÒóÇäò Ãóæú ãõÔúÑößñ æóÍõÑøöãó Ğáößó Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (The Zani marries not but a Zaniyah or a Mushrikah; and the Zaniyah, none marries her except Zani or a Mushrik. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers.) 24:3 Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóäúßöÍõ ÇáÒøóÇäöí ÇáúãóÌúáõæÏõ ÅöáøóÇ ãöËúáóåõ»</div><br>  (A Zani who has been flogged should not marry anyone except someone who is like him.) A similar report was recorded by Abu Dawud in his Sunan.  </div></body></html>
