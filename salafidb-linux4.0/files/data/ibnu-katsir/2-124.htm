This honor was given to Prophet Ibrahim when he adhered to Allah's decisions and prohibitions.

Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad ) and those who have believed (Muslims). And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers) (3:67-68).  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈößóáöãóÜÊö</div><br>  (with Kalimat (words)) which means, "Laws, commandments and prohibitions.'' `Words' as mentioned here, sometimes refers to what Allah has willed, such as Allah's statement about Maryam,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÕóÏøóŞóÊú ÈößóáöãóÜÊö ÑóÈøóåóÇ æóßõÊõÈöåö æóßóÇäóÊú ãöäó ÇáúŞóÜäöÊöíäó</div><br>  (And she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord, and (also believed in) His Scriptures, and she was of the Qanitin (i.e. obedient to Allah)) (66:12).

"Words'' also means truthful news, or a just commandment or prohibition. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞö ÇÈúÊóáóì ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó ÑóÈøõåõ ÈößóáöãóÜÊò İóÃóÊóãøóåõäøó</div><br>  (And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim tried him with (certain) Words (commands), which he fulfilled) meaning, he adhered to them, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì ÌóÜÚöáõßó áöáäøóÇÓö ÅöãóÇãğÇ</div><br>  ("Verily, I am going to make you an Imam (a leader) for mankind (to follow you).'') as a reward for Ibrahim's good deeds, adhering to the commandments and avoiding the prohibitions. This is why Allah made Ibrahim a role model for the people, and an Imam whose conduct and path are imitated and followed. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>What were the Words that Ibrahim was tested with</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  There is a difference of opinion over the words that Allah tested Ibrahim with. There are several opinions attributed to Ibn `Abbas. For instance, `Abdur-Razzaq said that Ibn `Abbas said, "Allah tested him with the rituals (of Hajj).'' Abu Ishaq reported the same. `Abdur-Razzaq also narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞö ÇÈúÊóáóì ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó ÑóÈøõåõ ÈößóáöãóÜÊò</div><br>  (And (remember) when the Lord of Ibrahim (Abraham) (i.e., Allah) tried him with (certain) commands) means, "Allah tested him with Taharah (purity, ablution): five on the head and five on the body. As for the head, they are cutting the mustache, rinsing the mouth, inhaling and discarding water, using Siwak and parting the hair. As for the body, they are trimming the nails, shaving the pubic hair, circumcision and plucking under the arm and washing with water after answering the call of nature.'' Ibn Abi Hatim said, "A similar statement was also reported from Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, An-Nakha`i, Abu Salih, Abu Al-Jald, and so forth.''  There is a similar statement that Imam Muslim narrated from `A'ishah who said that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÚóÔúÑñ ãöäó ÇáúİöØúÑóÉö: ŞóÕøõ ÇáÔøóÇÑöÈö æóÅöÚúİóÇÁõ ÇááøöÍúíóÉö æóÇáÓøöæóÇßõ æóÇÓúÊöäúÔóÇŞõ ÇáúãóÇÁö æóŞóÕøõ ÇáúÃóÙúİóÇÑö æóÛóÓúáõ ÇáúÈóÑóÇÌöãö æóäóÊúİõ ÇáúÅöÈúØö æóÍóáúŞõ ÇáúÚóÇäóÉö æóÇäúÊöŞóÇÕõ ÇáúãóÇÁö æóäóÓöíÊõ ÇáúÚóÇÔöÑóÉó ÅöáøóÇ Ãóäú Êóßõæäó ÇáúãóÖúãóÖóÉ»</div><br>  (Ten are among the Fitrah (instinct, natural constitution): trimming the mustache, growing the beard, using Siwak, inhaling and then exhaling water (in ablution), cutting the nails, washing between the fingers (in ablution), plucking the underarm hair, shaving the pubic hair, washing with water after answering the call of nature, (and I forgot the tenth, I think it was) rinsing the mouth (in ablution).)  The Two Sahihs recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúİöØúÑóÉõ ÎóãúÓñ: ÇáúÎöÊóÇäõ æóÇáúÇÓúÊöÍúÏóÇÏõ æóŞóÕøõ ÇáÔøóÇÑöÈö æóÊóŞúáöíãõ ÇáúÃóÙúİóÇÑö æóäóÊúİõ ÇáúÅöÈúØ»</div><br>  (Five are among the acts of Fitrah: circumcision, shaving the pubic hair, trimming the mustache, cutting the nails and plucking the underarm hair.) This is the wording with Muslim.  Muhammad bin Ishaq reportd that Ibn `Abbas said, "The words that Allah tested Ibrahim with, and that he implemented were: abandoning his (disbelieving) people when Allah commanded him to do so, disputing with Nimrod (king of Babylon) about Allah, being patient when he was thrown in the fire (although this was extremely traumatic) migrating from his homeland when Allah commanded him to do so, patience with the monetary and material demands of hosting guests by Allah's command, and Allah's order for him to slaughter his son. When Allah tested Ibrahim with these words, and he was ready for the major test, Allah said to him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÓúáöãú ŞóÇáó ÃóÓúáóãúÊõ áöÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  ("Submit (be a Muslim)!'' He said, "I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists. '') (2:131) although this meant defying and being apart from the people.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Unjust do not qualify for Allah's Promise</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said that Ibrahim said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ĞõÑøöíóÊöì</div><br>  (And of my offspring (to make leaders)) and Allah replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóäóÇáõ ÚóåúÏöí ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (My covenant (prophethood) includes not Zalimin (polytheists and wrongdoers)).  When Allah made Ibrahim an Imam (Leader for the faithful), he asked Allah that Imams thereafter be chosen from his offspring. Allah accepted his supplication, but told him that there will be unjust people among his offspring and they will not benefit from Allah's promise. Thus, they will neither become Imams nor be imitated (for they will not be righteous). The proof that Ibrahim's supplication to Allah was accepted is that Allah said in Surat Al-`Ankabut (29:27),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöì ĞõÑøöíøóÊöåö ÇáäøõÈõæøóÉó æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (And We ordained among his offspring prophethood and the Book).  Hence, every Prophet whom Allah sent after Ibrahim were from among his offspring, and every Book that Allah revealed was to them. As for Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó áÇó íóäóÇáõ ÚóåúÏöí ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  ((Allah) said, "My covenant (prophethood) includes not Zalimin (polytheists and wrongdoers). '')  Allah mentioned that there are unjust people among the offspring of Ibrahim, and they will not benefit from Allah's promise, nor would they be entrusted with anything, even though they are among the children of Allah's Khalil (intimate friend, Prophet Abraham). There will also be those who do good among the children of Ibrahim, and these it is who will benefit from Ibrahim's supplication. Ibn Jarir said that this Ayah indicated that the unjust shall not be Imams for the people. Moreover, the Ayah informed Ibrahim that there will be unjust people among his offspring. Also, Ibn Khuwayz Mindad Al-Maliki said, "The unjust person does not qualify to be a Khalifah, a ruler, one who gives religious verdicts, a witness, or even a narrator (of Hadiths).''  </div></body></html>
