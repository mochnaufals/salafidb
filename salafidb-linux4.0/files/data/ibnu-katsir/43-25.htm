This is not the case. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÃóäÒóáúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ÓõáúØóÜäÇğ İóåõæó íóÊóßóáøóãõ ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú Èöåö íõÔúÑößõæäó </div><br>  (Or have We revealed to them an authority (a Scripture), which speaks of that which they have been associating with Him) (30:35) meaning, that did not happen.

They say: "we found our fathers following a certain way and religion (Ummah), and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.'') meaning, they have no grounds for their belief in idolatry apart from the fact that they are imitating their fathers and forefathers who were following a certain Ummah or way, i.e., religion. The word Ummah is used in a similar manner elsewhere, where Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóÜĞöåö ÃõãøóÊõßõãú ÃõãøóÉğ æóÇÍöÏóÉğ</div><br>  (And verily, this your religion (Ummah) is one religion) (23:52), and they said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóÇ Úóáóì ÁóÇËóÜÑöåöã</div><br>  (and we by their footsteps) means, behind them   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõåúÊóÏõæäó</div><br>  (We guide ourselves) This is their claim with no evidence. Then Allah points out that what these people say was already said by those who were like them among the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers.
