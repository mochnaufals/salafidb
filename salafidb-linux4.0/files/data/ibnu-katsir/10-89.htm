And Musa said: "Our Lord! You have indeed bestowed on Fir`awn and his chiefs splendor and wealth in the life of this world, our Lord! That they may lead men astray from Your path. Our Lord! Destroy their wealth, and harden their hearts, so that they will not believe until they see the painful torment.'') (89. Allah said: "Verily, the invocation of you both is accepted. So you both keep to the straight way, and follow not the path of those who know not.'')</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Musa supplicated against Fir`awn and His Chiefs</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah mentioned what Musa said when he prayed against Fir`awn and his chiefs after they refused to accept the truth. They continued to go astray and be haughty and arrogant. Musa said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÂ Åöäøóßó ÁÇÊóíúÊó İöÑúÚóæúäó æóãóáÇøåõ ÒöíäóÉğ</div><br>  (Our Lord! You have indeed bestowed on Fir`awn and his chiefs splendor) and pleasure of this worldly life.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãúæóÇáÇğ</div><br>  (and wealth) plentiful and abundant. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÑóÈøóäóÇ áöíõÖöáøõæÇú Úóä ÓóÈöíáößó</div><br>  (in the life of this world, Our Lord! That they may lead men astray from Your path.) was read with the word "Liyadillu'' and "Liyudillu.'' The first is with a Fathah over the Ya, meaning that "You have given them that while You know they would not believe in what You have sent me with to them. You did that so they would gradually be drawn away from the truth.'' As Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöäóİúÊöäóåõãú İöíåö</div><br>  (that We may test them thereby.)(20:131) and (72:17). Others read the word with a Dammah over the Ya. (i.e. Liyudillu) This makes the Ayah mean: You have given them that so whoever You willed from among Your creatures will be tried. Those whom You wish to misguide would think that You have given them that because You loved them and You cared about them.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÇ ÇØúãöÓú Úóáóì Ãóãúæóáöåöãú</div><br>  ("Our Lord! Destroy their wealth,'') Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid said: "They asked Allah to destroy their wealth.'' Ad-Dahhak, Abu Al-`Aliyah and Ar-Rabi`a bin Anas said: "Allah made their wealth into engraved stones as it was before.'' About Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÔúÏõÏú Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú</div><br>  (and harden their hearts) Ibn `Abbas said, "Harden their hearts means put a seal on them.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó íõÄúãöäõæÇú ÍóÊøóì íóÑóæõÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáÇøñáöíãó</div><br>  (so that they will not believe until they see the painful torment.) This prayer was from Musa because he was angry for the sake of Allah and His religion. He prayed against Fir`awn and his chiefs when he was certain that there was no good in them. Similarly, Nuh prayed and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó äõæÍñ ÑøóÈøö áÇó ÊóĞóÑú Úóáóì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ãöäó ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÏóíøóÇÑÇğ - Åöäøóßó Åöä ÊóĞóÑúåõãú íõÖöáøõæÇú ÚöÈóÇÏóßó æóáÇó íóáöÏõæÇú ÅöáÇøó İóÇÌöÑÇğ ßóİøóÇÑÇğ </div><br>  (My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers on the earth! If You leave them, they will mislead Your servants, and they will beget none but wicked disbelievers.) (71:26-27) Harun said "Amin'' to his brother's prayer. And Allah answered Musa's prayer. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃõÌöíÈóÊú ÏøóÚúæóÊõßõãóÇ</div><br>  (Verily, the invocation of you both is accepted.) `in destroying Fir`awn's people.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃõÌöíÈóÊú ÏøóÚúæóÊõßõãóÇ İóÇÓúÊóŞöíãóÇ</div><br>  (Verily I have answered your prayers (both of you). So you both keep to the straight way) So as I have answered your prayer, you should remain steadfast on My command.' Ibn Jurayj narrated that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah: "Be steadfast and follow My command.''  </div></body></html>
