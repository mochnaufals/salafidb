The Scriptures of Ibrahim and Musa.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>A Statement concerning the People of Success</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃóİúáóÍó ãóä ÊóÒóßøóì </div><br>  (Indeed whosoever purifies himself shall achieve success.) meaning, he purifies himself from despised characteristics and he follows what Allah has revealed to the Messenger .   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóĞóßóÑó ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøöåö İóÕóáøóì </div><br>  (And remembers the Name of his Lord, and performs Salah.) meaning, he establishes the prayer in its appointed time, seeking the pleasure of Allah, obedience to His command, and implementation of His Law. We have already reported from the Commander of the believers, `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, that he used to command the people to give the Sadaqat Al-Fitr, and he would recite this Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃóİúáóÍó ãóä ÊóÒóßøóì - æóĞóßóÑó ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøöåö İóÕóáøóì </div><br>  (Indeed whosoever purifies himself shall achieve success. And remembers the Name of his Lord, and performs Salah.) Abu Al-Ahwas said, "If someone comes to any of you begging, and he wants to pray, then he should give charity (Zakah) before he prays. For verily, Allah the Exalted says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃóİúáóÍó ãóä ÊóÒóßøóì - æóĞóßóÑó ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøöåö İóÕóáøóì </div><br>  (Indeed whosoever purifies himself shall achieve success. And remembers the Name of his Lord, and performs Salah.)'' Qatadah said concerning this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃóİúáóÍó ãóä ÊóÒóßøóì - æóĞóßóÑó ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøöåö İóÕóáøóì </div><br>  (Indeed whosoever purifies himself shall achieve success. And remembers the Name of his Lord, and performs Salah (Fasalla).) "He purifies his wealth and pleases his Creator.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>This World is Worthless in Comparison to the Hereafter</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ÊõÄúËöÑõæäó ÇáúÍóíóæÉó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ </div><br>  (Rather you prefer the life of this world.) meaning, `you give it precedence over the matter of the Hereafter, and you prefer it because of what it contains of usefulness and benefit for you in livelihood, and your returns (i.e., income, profitable gain).'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉõ ÎóíúÑñ æóÃóÈúŞóì </div><br>  (Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.) meaning, the reward of the final abode is better than the worldly life, and it is more lasting. For indeed, this worldly life is lowly and temporal, whereas the Hereafter is noble and eternal. Thus, how can an intelligent person prefer that which is short-lived over that which is eternal. How can he give importance to that which will soon pass away from him, while ignoring the importance of the abode of eternity and infinity. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóÍóÈøó ÏõäúíóÇåõ ÃóÖóÑøó ÈöÂÎöÑóÊöåö¡ æóãóäú ÃóÍóÈøó ÂÎöÑóÊóåõ ÃóÖóÑøó ÈöÏõäúíóÇåõ¡ İóÂËöÑõæÇ ãóÇ íóÈúŞóì Úóáóì ãóÇ íóİúäóì»</div><br>  (Whoever loves his worldly life, will suffer in his Hereafter, and whoever loves his worldly life, will suffer in his Hereafter, and whoever loves his Hereafter, will suffer in his worldly life. Therefore, chose that which is everlasting over that which is temporal.) Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Scriptures of Ibrahim and Musa</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóÜĞóÇ áóİöì ÇáÕøõÍõİö ÇáÇøòæáóì - ÕõÍõİö ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóãõæÓóì </div><br>  (Verily, this is in the former Scriptures -- the Scriptures of Ibrahim and Musa.) This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement in Surat An-Najm,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú áóãú íõäóÈøóÃú ÈöãóÇ İöì ÕõÍõİö ãõæÓóì - æóÅöÈúÑóåöíãó ÇáøóĞöì æóİøóì - ÃóáÇøó ÊóÒöÑõ æóÒöÑóÉñ æöÒúÑó ÃõÎúÑóì - æóÃóä áøóíúÓó áöáÅöäÓóÜäö ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ÓóÚóì - æóÃóäøó ÓóÚúíóåõ Óóæúİó íõÑóì - Ëõãøó íõÌúÒóÇåõ ÇáúÌóÒóÂÁó ÇáÃóæúİóì - æóÃóäøó Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó ÇáúãõäÊóåóì </div><br>  (Or is he not informed with what is in the Scriptures of Musa. And of Ibrahim who fulfilled (or conveyed) all that (Allah ordered him to do or convey): that no burdened person (with sins) shall bear the burden (sins) of another. And that man can have nothing but what he does. And that his deeds will be seen. Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best recompense. And that to your Lord is the End (Return of everything).) (53:36-42) And so forth, until the end of these Ayat. Abu `Aliyah said, "The story of this Surah is in the earlier Scriptures.'' Ibn Jarir preferred the view that the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóĞóÂ</div><br>  (Verily, this) is referring to His previous statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃóİúáóÍó ãóä ÊóÒóßøóì - æóĞóßóÑó ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøöåö İóÕóáøóì - Èóáú ÊõÄúËöÑõæäó ÇáúÍóíóæÉó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ - æóÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉõ ÎóíúÑñ æóÃóÈúŞóì </div><br>  (Indeed whosoever purifies himself shall achieve success. And remembers the Name of his Lord, and offers Salah. Rather you prefer the life of this world. Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóĞóÂ</div><br>  (Verily, this) meaning, the content of this discussion,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóÜĞóÇ áóİöì ÇáÕøõÍõİö ÇáÇøòæáóì - ÕõÍõİö ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóãõæÓóì </div><br>  (in the former Scriptures, the Scriptures of Ibrahim and Musa.) This view that he (At-Tabari) has chosen is good and strong. Similar to it has been reported from Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-A`la (Sabbih). All praise and blessings are due to Allah, and He is the Giver of success and protection from error.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
