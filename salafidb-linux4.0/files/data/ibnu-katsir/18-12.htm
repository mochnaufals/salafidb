He is not incapable of doing more amazing things than the story of the people of the Cave. Similarly, Ibn Jurayj reported Mujahid saying about,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÍóÓöÈúÊó Ãóäøó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈó Çáúßóåúİö æóÇáÑøóŞöíãö ßóÇäõæÇú ãöäú ÁóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ ÚóÌóÈğÇ </div><br>  (Do you think that the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim were a wonder among Our signs) "Among Our signs are things that are more amazing than this.'' Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÍóÓöÈúÊó Ãóäøó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈó Çáúßóåúİö æóÇáÑøóŞöíãö ßóÇäõæÇú ãöäú ÁóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ ÚóÌóÈğÇ </div><br>  (Do you think that the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim were a wonder among Our signs) "What I have given to you of knowledge, the Sunnah and the Book is far better than the story of the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim.'' Muhammad bin Ishaq said: "(It means) I have not shown My creatures a proof more amazing than the story of the people of the Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim.'' iAl-Kahf refers to a cave in a mountain, which is where the young men sought refuge. With regard to the word Ar-Raqim, Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that it is a valley near Aylah. This was also said in another narration by `Atiyah Al-`Awfi and Qatadah. Ad-Dahhak said: "As for Al-Kahf, it is a cave in the valley, and Ar-Raqim is the name of the valley.'' Mujahid said, "Ar-Raqim refers to their buildings.'' Others said it refers to the valley in which their cave was. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Ar-Raqim: "Ka`b used to say that it was the town.'' Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "Ar-Raqim is the mountain in which the cave was.'' Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "Ar-Raqim is a tablet of stone on which they wrote the story of the people of the Cave, then they placed it at the entrance to the Cave.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú Ãóæóì ÇáúİöÊúíóÉõ Åöáóì Çáúßóåúİö İóŞóÇáõæÇú ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÁóÇÊöäóÇ ãöä áøóÏõäßó ÑóÍúãóÉğ æóåóíøöìÁú áóäóÇ ãöäú ÃóãúÑöäóÇ ÑóÔóÏğÇ </div><br>  ((Remember) when the young men fled for refuge to Al-Kahf. They said: "Our Lord! Bestow on us mercy from Yourself, and facilitate for us our affair in the right way!'') Here Allah tells us about those young men who fled from their people for the sake of their religion, fearing persecution. So they fled taking refuge in the cave of a mountain, where they hid from their people. When they entered the cave, they asked Allah to show mercy and kindness towards them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÁóÇÊöäóÇ ãöä áøóÏõäßó ÑóÍúãóÉğ</div><br>  (Our Lord!

As was reported in the Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóãóÇ ŞóÖóíúÊó áóäóÇ ãöäú ŞóÖóÇÁò İóÇÌúÚóáú ÚóÇŞöÈóÊóåõ ÑóÔóÏğÇ»</div><br>  (Whatever You have decreed for us, make its consequences good).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÖóÑóÈúäóÇ Úóáóì ÁóÇĞóÇäöåöãú İöì Çáúßóåúİö Óöäöíäó ÚóÏóÏğÇ </div><br>  (Therefore, We covered up their hearing in the cave for a number of years.) meaning, `We caused them to sleep when they entered the cave, and they slept for many years.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÈóÚóËúäóÜåõãú</div><br>  (Then We raised them up) from that slumber, and one of them went out with his Dirhams (silver coins) to buy them some food, as it will be discussed in more detail below. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÈóÚóËúäóÜåõãú áöäóÚúáóãó Ãóíøõ ÇáÍöÒúÈóíúäö</div><br>  (Then We raised them up, that We might test which of the two parties) meaning, the two parties who disputed about them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÍúÕóì áöãóÇ áóÈöËõæÇú ÃóãóÏğÇ</div><br>  (was best at calculating the time period that they tarried.) It was said that this refers to how long they stayed in the cave.  </div></body></html>
