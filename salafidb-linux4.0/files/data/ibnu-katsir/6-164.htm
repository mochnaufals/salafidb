This Ayah commands sincerely trusting Allah, while the Ayah before it commands sincerely worshipping Allah alone without partners. These two meanings are often mentioned together in the Qur'an. Allah directs His servants to proclaim,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöíøóÇßó äóÚúÈõÏõ æóÅöíøóÇßó äóÓúÊóÚöíäõ </div><br>  (You (alone) we worship, and You (alone) we ask for help (for each and every thing).) 1:5 Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúÈõÏúåõ æóÊóæóßøóáú Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (So worship Him and put your trust in Him.) 11:123, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Èöåö æóÚóáóíúåö ÊóæóßøóáúäóÇ</div><br>  (Say: "He is the Most Gracious (Allah), in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust''.) 67:29, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøóÈøõ ÇáúãóÔúÑöŞö æóÇáúãóÛúÑöÈö áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó İóÇÊøóÎöĞúåõ æóßöíáÇğ </div><br>  (Lord of the east and the west; none has the right to be worshipped but He. So take Him a guardian.) 73:9 There are similar Ayat on this subject. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Every Person Carries His Own Burden</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóßúÓöÈõ ßõáøõ äóİúÓò ÅöáÇøó ÚóáóíúåóÇ æóáÇó ÊóÒöÑõ æóÇÒöÑóÉñ æöÒúÑó ÃõÎúÑóì</div><br>  (No person earns any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.) thus emphasizing Allah's reckoning, decision and justice that will occur on the Day of Resurrection. The souls will only be recompensed for their deeds, good for good and evil for evil. No person shall carry the burden of another person, a fact that indicates Allah's perfect justice. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÊóÏúÚõ ãõËúŞóáóÉñ Åöáóì ÍöãúáöåóÇ áÇó íõÍúãóáú ãöäúåõ ÔóìúÁñ æóáóæú ßóÇäó ĞóÇ ŞõÑúÈóì</div><br>  (And if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin.) 35:18, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó íóÎóÇİõ ÙõáúãÇğ æóáÇó åóÖúãÇğ</div><br>  (Then he will have no fear of injustice, nor of any curtailment (of his reward).) 20:112 Scholars of Tafsir commented, "No person will be wronged by carrying the evil deeds of another person, nor will his own good deeds be curtailed or decreased.'' Allah also said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøõ äóİúÓò ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈóÊú ÑóåöíäóÉñ - ÅöáÇøó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈó Çáúíóãöíäö </div><br>  (Every person is a pledge for what he has earned. Except those on the Right.) 74:38-39, meaning, every person will be tied to his evil deeds. But, for those on the right -- the believers -- the blessing of their good works will benefit their offspring and relatives, as well. Allah said in Surat At-Tur,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÇÊøóÈóÚóÊúåõãú ĞõÑøöíøóÊõåõã ÈöÅöíãóÜäò ÃóáúÍóŞúäóÇ Èöåöãú ĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõãú æóãóÂ ÃóáóÊúäóÜåõãú ãøöäú Úóãóáöåöã ãøöä ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) 52:21, meaning, We shall elevate their offspring to their high grades in Paradise, even though the deeds of the offspring were less righteous, since they shared faith with them in its general form. Allah says, We did not decrease the grades of these righteous believers so that those (their offspring and relatives) who have lesser grades, can share the same grades as them. Rather Allah elevated the lesser believers to the grades of their parents by the blessing of their parents' good works, by His favor and bounty. Allah said next (in Surat At-Tur),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøõ ÇãúÑöìÁò ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈó Ñóåóíäñ</div><br>  (Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) 52:21, meaning, of evil. Allah's statement here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó Åöáóì ÑóÈøößõãú ãøóÑúÌöÚõßõãú İóíõäóÈøöÆõßõã ÈöãóÇ ßõäÊõãú İöíåö ÊóÎúÊóáöİõæäó</div><br>  (Then unto your Lord is your return, so He will tell you that wherein you have been differing.) means, work you (disbelievers), and we will also work. Surely, both you and us will be gathered to Allah and He will inform us of our deeds and your deeds and the decision on what we used to dispute about in the life of this world. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõá áÇøó ÊõÓúÜóáõæäó ÚóãøóÂ ÃóÌúÑóãúäóÇ æóáÇó äõÓúÜóáõ ÚóãøóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó - Şõáú íóÌúãóÚõ ÈóíúäóäóÇ ÑóÈøõäóÇ Ëõãøó íóİúÊóÍõ ÈóíúäóäóÇ ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö æóåõæó ÇáúİóÊøóÇÍõ ÇáúÚóáöíãõ </div><br>  (Say: "You will not be asked about our sins, nor shall we be asked of what you do." Say: "Our Lord will assemble us all together, then He will judge between us with truth. And He is the Just Judge, the All-Knower of the true state of affairs.") 34:25-26.  </div></body></html>
