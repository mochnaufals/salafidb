In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúßöÈúÑõ ÈóØóÑõ ÇáúÍóŞøö æóÛóãúÕõ ÇáäøóÇÓ»</div><br>  (Arrogance is refusing the truth and belittling people.) And in another Version   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÛóãúØõ ÇáäøóÇÓ»</div><br>  (And despising people) It is forbidden to scoff at and belittle people, for the injured party could be more honored and dearer to Allah the Exalted than those who ridicule and belittle them. This is why Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó íóÓúÎóÑú Şóæúãñ ãøöä Şóæúãò ÚóÓóì Ãóä íóßõæäõæÇú ÎóíúÑÇğ ãøöäúåõãú æóáÇó äöÓóÂÁñ ãøöä äøöÓóÂÁò ÚóÓóì Ãóä íóßõäøó ÎóíúÑÇğ ãøöäúåõäøó</div><br>  (O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former.) thus, stating this prohibition for men and then women. The statement of Allah the Exalted,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóáúãöÒõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóßõãú</div><br>  (Nor defame yourselves,) forbids defaming each other. He among men who is a slanderer, and a backbiter, is cursed and condemned as Allah states   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíúáñ áøößõáøö åõãóÒóÉò áøõãóÒóÉò </div><br>  (Woe to every Humazah, Lumazah)(104:1) Hamz is defamation by action, while Lamz is by words. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóãøóÇÒò ãøóÔøóÂÁö Èöäóãöíãò </div><br>  (Hammaz (defaming), going about with slander.) (68:11) meaning, he belittles and defames people, transgressing and spreading slander among them, which is the Lamz that uses words as its tool. Allah's statement here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóáúãöÒõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóßõãú</div><br>  (Nor defame yourselves,) just as He said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóŞúÊõáõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóßõãú</div><br>  (Nor kill yourselves) (4:29), meaning, nor kill one another. `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóáúãöÒõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóßõãú</div><br>  (Nor defame yourselves,) means, none of you should defame each other,' while,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóäóÇÈóÒõæÇú ÈöÇáÇøñáúŞóÜÈö</div><br>  (nor insult one another by nicknames.) means, `you should not address people by nick names that people dislike.' Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Jabirah bin Ad-Dahhak said, "This Ayah was revealed about us, Banu Salamah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóäóÇÈóÒõæÇú ÈöÇáÇøñáúŞóÜÈö</div><br>  (nor insult one another by nicknames.) When the Messenger of Allah migrated to Al-Madinah, every man among us had two or three nicknames. When the Prophet called a man by one of these nicknames, people would say, `O Allah's Messenger! He hates that nickname.' Then this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóäóÇÈóÒõæÇú ÈöÇáÇøñáúŞóÜÈö</div><br>  (nor insult one another by nicknames.) was revealed.'' Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith. The statement of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÆúÓó ÇáÇÓúãõ ÇáúİõÓõæŞõ ÈóÚúÏó ÇáÇíãóÇäö</div><br>  (Evil is the name of wickedness after faith), means, the names and descriptions of wickedness are evil; meaning, `to use the nicknames that were used by the people of Jahiliyyah, after you embraced Islam and understood it,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä áøóãú íóÊõÈú</div><br>  (And whosoever does not repent,) means, from this sin,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãõæäó</div><br>  (then such are indeed wrongdoers.)  </div></body></html>
