As for the Jews, they claimed that `Uzayr was the son of God, Allah is free of what they attribute to Him. As for the misguidance of Christians over `Isa, it is obvious. This is why Allah declared both groups to be liars,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó Şóæúáõåõã ÈöÃóİúæóåöåöãú</div><br>  (That is their saying with their mouths), but they have no proof that supports their claim, other than lies and fabrications,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÖóÜåöÆõæäó</div><br>  (resembling), imitating,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şóæúáó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime.)

Imam Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded a Hadith via several chains of narration, from `Adi bin Hatim, may Allah be pleased with him, who became Christian during the time of Jahiliyyah. When the call of the Messenger of Allah reached his area, `Adi ran away to Ash-Sham, and his sister and several of his people were captured. The Messenger of Allah freed his sister and gave her gifts. So she went to her brother and encouraged him to become Muslim and to go to the Messenger of Allah . `Adi, who was one of the chiefs of his people (the tribe of Tai') and whose father, Hatim At-Ta'i, was known for his generosity, went to Al-Madinah. When the people announced his arrival, `Adi went to the Messenger of Allah wearing a silver cross around his neck. The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÊøóÎóĞõæÇú ÃóÍúÈóÜÑóåõãú æóÑõåúÈóÜäóåõãú ÃóÑúÈóÇÈÇğ ãøöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (They took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah).  `Adi commented, "I said, `They did not worship them.''' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Èóáóì Åöäøóåõãú ÍóÑøóãõæÇ Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáúÍóáóÇáó æóÃóÍóáøõæÇ áóåõãõ ÇáúÍóÑóÇãó İóÇÊøóÈóÚõæåõãú İóĞóáößó ÚöÈóÇÏóÊõåõãú ÅöíøóÇåõã»</div><br>  (Yes they did. They (rabbis and monks) prohibited the allowed for them (Christians and Jews) and allowed the prohibited, and they obeyed them. This is how they worshipped them.) The Messenger of Allah said to `Adi,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÚóÏöíøõ ãóÇ ÊóŞõæáõ¿ ÃóíõİöÑøõßó Ãóäú íõŞóÇáó: Çááåõ ÃóßúÈóÑó¿ İóåóáú ÊóÚúáóãõ ÔóíúÆğÇ ÃóßúÈóÑó ãöäó Çááåö¿ ãóÇ íõİöÑøõßó¿ ÃóíõİöÑøõßó Ãóäú íõŞóÇáó: áóÇ Åöáóåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ¿ İóåóáú ÊóÚúáóãõ ãóäú Åöáåñ ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ¿»</div><br>  (O `Adi what do you say Did you run away (to Ash-Sham) so that 'Allahu Akbar' (Allah is the Great) is not pronounced Do you know of anything greater than Allah What made you run away Did you run away so that `La ilaha illallah' is not pronounced Do you know of any deity worthy of worship except Allah)  The Messenger invited `Adi to embrace Islam, and he embraced Islam and pronounced the Testimony of Truth. The face of the Messenger of Allah beamed with pleasure and he said to `Adi,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáúíóåõæÏó ãóÛúÖõæÈñ Úóáóíúåöãú æóÇáäøóÕóÇÑóì ÖóÇáøõæä»</div><br>  (Verily, the Jews have earned the anger (of Allah) and the Christians are misguided.) Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman, `Abdullah bin `Abbas and several others said about the explanation of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÊøóÎóĞõæÇú ÃóÍúÈóÜÑóåõãú æóÑõåúÈóÜäóåõãú ÃóÑúÈóÇÈÇğ ãøöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (They took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah...) that the Christians and Jews obeyed their monks and rabbis in whatever they allowed or prohibited for them.
