As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåõã ãøõŞúãóÍõæäó</div><br>  (so that their heads are raised up.) Mentioning the chains around the neck is sufficient and there is no need to mention the hands, although they are referred to by implication. Al-`Awfi said, narrating from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, concerning the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöì ÃóÚúäÜŞöåöãú ÃóÛúáóÜáÇğ İóåöìó Åöáóì ÇáÇøñĞúŞóÜäö İóåõã ãøõŞúãóÍõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, We have put on their necks iron collars reaching to the chins, so that their heads are raised up.) This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÌúÚóáú íóÏóßó ãóÛúáõæáóÉğ Åöáóì ÚõäõŞößó</div><br>  (And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck)(17:29). meaning that their hands are tied to their necks and they cannot stretch them forth in order to do any good deeds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåõã ãøõŞúãóÍõæäó</div><br>  (so that their heads are raised up.) according to Mujahid it means their heads are raised, and their hands are placed over their mouths, so they are restrained from doing anything good.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ãöä Èóíúäö ÃóíúÏöíåöãú ÓóÏøÇğ</div><br>  (And We have put a barrier before them,) Mujahid said, "Between them and the truth.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æãöäú Îóáúİöåöãú ÓóÏøÇğ</div><br>  (and a barrier behind them,) Mujahid said, "Between them and the truth, so they are confused.'' Qatadah said, "They move from one form of misguidance to another.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃÛúÔóíúäóÜåõãú</div><br>  (and We have covered them up,) means, `We have blinded their eyes to the truth.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåõãú áÇó íõÈúÕöÑõæäó</div><br>  (so that they cannot see.) means, they cannot benefit from goodness or be guided to it. Ibn Jarir said, "It was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that he used to recite "Fa a`shaynahum'' instead of Fa'aghshaynahum, from Al-`Asha (weakness of the sight, blindness), which is a complaint of the eye.'' `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, "Allah placed this barrier between them and Islam and Iman, so that they will never reach it,'' and he recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÍóŞøóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó - æóáóæú ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ßõáøõ ÁÇíóÉò ÍóÊøóì íóÑóæõÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáÇøñáöíãó </div><br>  (Truly, those, against whom the Word (wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe, Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.) (10:96-97). Then he said, "Whoever has been prevented by Allah, will never be able.'' `Ikrimah said, "Abu Jahl said, `If I see Muhammad, I will do such and such.' Then Allah revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöì ÃóÚúäÜŞöåöãú ÃóÛúáóÜáÇğ</div><br>  (Verily, We have put on their necks iron collars...) up to:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåõãú áÇó íõÈúÕöÑõæäó</div><br>  (so that they cannot see.)'' He said, "They used to say, `Here is Muhammad,' and he would say, `Where is he Where is he' And he would not be able to see him.'' Ibn Jarir also recorded this.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóæóÂÁõ Úóáóíúåöãú ÃóÁóäĞóÑúÊóåõãú Ãóãú áóãú ÊõäĞöÑúåõãú áÇó íõÄãöäõæäó </div><br>  (It is the same to them whether you warn them or you warn them not, they will not believe.) means, Allah has decreed that they will be misguided, so warning them will not help them and will not have any effect on them. Something similar has already been seen at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah, and Allah also says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÍóŞøóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó - æóáóæú ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ßõáøõ ÁÇíóÉò ÍóÊøóì íóÑóæõÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáÇøñáöíãó </div><br>  (Truly, those, against whom the Word (wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe, Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.)(10:96-97).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÊõäĞöÑõ ãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚó ÇáĞøößúÑó</div><br>  (You can only warn him who follows the Reminder,) means, `only the believers will benefit from your warning, those who follow the Reminder,' which is the Qur'an.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÎÔöìó ÇáÑøóÍúãÜäó ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö</div><br>  (and fears the Most Gracious unseen.) means, even when no one sees him except Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, he knows that Allah is watching him and sees what he does.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈóÔøöÑúåõ ÈöãóÛúİöÑóÉò</div><br>  (Bear you to such one the glad tidings of forgiveness,) i.e., of his sins,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÌúÑò ßóÑöíãò</div><br>  (and a generous reward.) means, one that is vast and great and beautiful. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÎúÔóæúäó ÑóÈøóåõã ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö áóåõã ãøóÛúİöÑóÉñ æóÃóÌúÑñ ßóÈöíÑñ </div><br>  (Verily, those who fear their Lord unseen, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.) (67:12).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ äóÍúäõ äõÍúìö ÇáúãóæúÊóì</div><br>  (Verily, We give life to the dead,) means, on the Day of Resurrection. This also indicates that Allah gives life to the heart of whomever He wills among the disbelievers, those whose hearts have died in misguidance, by guiding them after that to the truth. As Allah says after mentioning hardness of the heart:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÚúáóãõæÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó íõÍúìö ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ÈóÚúÏó ãóæúÊöåóÇ ŞóÏú ÈóíøóäøóÇ áóßõãõ ÇáÇøñíóÜÊö áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÚúŞöáõæäó </div><br>  (Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death! Indeed We have made clear the Ayat to you, that you may understand.) (57:17)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóßúÊõÈõ ãóÇó ŞóÏøóãõæÇú</div><br>  (and We record that which they send before (them),) means, their deeds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇËóÇÑóåõãú</div><br>  (and their traces) means, `We write down the deeds which they used to do themselves, and the legacy they left behind, so We will requite them for that: if it is good, then We will reward them, and if it is evil, then We will punish them.' This is like the Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Óóäøó İöí ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãö ÓõäøóÉğ ÍóÓóäóÉğ ßóÇäó áóåõ ÃóÌúÑõåóÇ¡ æóÃóÌúÑõ ãóäú Úóãöáó ÈöåóÇ ãöäú ÈóÚúÏöåö ãöäú ÛóíúÑö Ãóäú íóäúŞõÕó ãöäú ÃõÌõæÑöåöãú ÔóíúÆğÇ¡ æóãóäú Óóäøó İöí ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãö ÓõäøóÉğ ÓóíøöÜÜÜÆóÜÉğ ßóÇäó Úóáóíúåö æöÒúÑõåóÇ æóæöÒúÑõ ãóäú Úóãöáó ÈöåóÇ ãöäú ÈóÚúÏöåö ãöäú ÛóíúÑö Ãóäú íóäúŞõÕó ãöäú ÃóæúÒóÇÑöåöãú ÔóíúÆğÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever starts (or sets an example of) something good in Islam, will have a reward for it, and a reward equal to that of everyone who does it after him, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. Whoever starts (or sets an example of) something evil in Islam, will bear the burden for that, and a burden equal to that of everyone who does it after him, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest.) This was recorded by Muslim from Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali, may Allah be pleased with him in which is detailed a story of the people from the Mudar tribe, who were wearing woollen rags. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this Hadith in full from Jarir bin `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him. In it the Prophet then recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóßúÊõÈõ ãóÇó ŞóÏøóãõæÇú æóÁóÇËóÇÑóåõãú</div><br>  (and We record that which they send before (them), and their traces) Muslim also recorded it with a different chain of narration. There is also another Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ãóÇÊó ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó ÇäúŞóØóÚó Úóãóáõåõ ÅöáøóÇ ãöäú ËóáóÇËò: ãöäú Úöáúãò íõäúÊóİóÚõ Èöåö¡ Ãóæú æóáóÏò ÕóÇáöÍò íóÏúÚõæ áóåõ¡ Ãóæú ÕóÏóŞóÉò ÌóÇÑöíóÉò ãöäú ÈóÚúÏöå»</div><br>  (When the son of Adam dies, all his deeds come to an end except three: knowledge which is beneficial to others, a righteous child who prays for him, or ongoing charity which he leaves behind. )'' Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported that Abu Sa`id said, "I heard Mujahid say concerning the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ äóÍúäõ äõÍúìö ÇáúãóæúÊóì æóäóßúÊõÈõ ãóÇó ŞóÏøóãõæÇú æóÁóÇËóÇÑóåõãú</div><br>  (Verily, We give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before (them), and their traces) `What they left behind of misguidance.''' Ibn Abi Najih and others said, narrating from Mujahid:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇó ŞóÏøóãõæÇú</div><br>  (that which they send before (them),) "Their deeds.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇËóÇÑóåõãú</div><br>  (and their traces). He said, "Their footsteps.'' This was also the view of Al-Hasan and Qatadah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇËóÇÑóåõãú</div><br>  (and their traces) means their footsteps. Qatadah said, "If Allah were to have neglected anything with regard to you, O son of Adam, He would have neglected what the wind could remove of these footsteps.'' But He takes into account the footsteps of the son of Adam and all his deeds; He even takes into account these footsteps and whether they are for the purpose of obeying Allah or disobeying Him. So, whoever can have his footsteps recorded for the purpose of obeying Allah, let him do that. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "There was an empty area around the Masjid, and Banu Salamah wanted to move to be closer to the Masjid. When the Messenger of Allah heard about that, he said to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóåõ ÈóáóÛóäöí Ãóäøóßõãú ÊõÑöíÏõæäó Ãóäú ÊóäúÊóŞöáõæÇ ŞõÑúÈó ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏö¿»</div><br>  (I have heard that you want to move close to the Masjid.) They said, `Yes, O Messenger of Allah, that is what we want.' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ Èóäöí ÓóáöãóÉó ÏöíóÇÑóßõãú ÊõßúÊóÈú ÂËóÇÑõßõãú¡ ÏöíóÇÑóßõãú ÊõßúÊóÈú ÂËóÇÑõßõã»</div><br>  (O Banu Salamah, stay where you are, and your footsteps will be recorded, stay where you are, and your footsteps will be recorded.)'' This was also recorded by Muslim from Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "A man died in Al-Madinah and the Prophet prayed over him, and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ áóíúÊóåõ ãóÇÊó İöí ÛóíúÑö ãóæúáöÏöå»</div><br>  (Would that he had died somewhere other than in his place of birth!) A man among the people said, `Why, O Messenger of Allah' The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáó ÅöĞóÇ Êõæõİøöíó İöí ÛóíúÑö ãóæúáöÏöåö¡ ŞöíÓó áóåõ ãöäú ãóæúáöÏöåö Åöáóì ãõäúŞóØöÚö ÃóËóÑöåö İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (When a man dies somewhere other than in his place of birth, it will be measured for him from where he was born to where his footsteps no longer appear, (and this is the space that will be allocated for him) in Paradise.)'' It was also recorded by An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. Ibn Jarir narrated that Thabit said, "I was walking with Anas and I began to walk quickly. He took my hand and we walked slowly, and when we had finished praying, Anas said, `I walked with Zayd bin Thabit and I was walking quickly, and he said: O Anas! Do you not feel that your footsteps are being written down''' There is no contradiction between this and the first report, on the contrary, this indicates the same thing somewhat more forcefully. Because these footsteps are being recorded, then those which are setting an example, whether good or bad, are more likely to be recorded. And Allah knows best.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõáøó ÔìúÁò ÃóÍúÕóíúäóÜåõ İöì ÅöãóÇãò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (and all things We have recorded with numbers (as a record) in Imam Mubin (a Clear Book).) means, everything that exists is precisely dictated in a record in Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz. Al-Imam Al-Mubin here refers to the source of all records. This was the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Similarly, Allah also says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó äóÏúÚõæÇú ßõáøó ÃõäóÇÓò ÈöÅöãóÜãöåöãú</div><br>  ((And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imam (record of good and bad deeds)) (17:71). meaning the Book of their deeds which will testify as to their deeds, whether they were good or bad. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæõÖöÚó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈõ æóÌöÜìÁó ÈöÇáäøóÈöíøöíúäó æóÇáÔøõåóÏóÂÁö</div><br>  (and the Book will be placed (open), and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward) (39:69), and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæõÖöÚó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈõ İóÊóÑóì ÇáúãõÌúÑöãöíäó ãõÔúİöŞöíäó ãöãøóÇ İöíåö æóíóŞõæáõæäó íæóíúáóÊóäóÇ ãóÇ áöåóÜĞóÇ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö áÇó íõÛóÇÏöÑõ ÕóÛöíÑóÉğ æóáÇó ßóÈöíÑóÉğ ÅöáÇøó ÃóÍúÕóÇåóÇ æóæóÌóÏõæÇú ãóÇ ÚóãöáõæÇú ÍóÇÖöÑğÇ æóáÇó íóÙúáöãõ ÑóÈøõßó ÃóÍóÏğÇ </div><br>  (And the Book (one's Record) will be placed, and you will see the criminals, fearful of that which is (recorded) therein.

And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no one with injustice.) (18:49).  </div></body></html>
