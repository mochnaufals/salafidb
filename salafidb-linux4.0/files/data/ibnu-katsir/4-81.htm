He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allah, but he who turns away, then We have not sent you as a watcher over them.) (81. They say: "We are obedient,'' but when they leave you, a section of them spends all night in planning other than what you say. But Allah records their nightly (plots). So turn aside from them (do not punish them), and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Obeying the Messenger is Obeying Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah states that whoever obeys His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys him, disobeys Allah. Verily, whatever the Messenger utters is not of his own desire, but a revelation inspired to him. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóØóÇÚóäöí İóŞóÏú ÃóØóÇÚó Çááåó¡ æóãóäú ÚóÕóÇäöí İóŞóÏú ÚóÕóì Çááåó¡ æóãóäú ÃóØóÇÚó ÇáúÃóãöíÑó İóŞóÏú ÃóØóÇÚóäöí¡ æóãóäú ÚóÕóì ÇáúÃóãöíÑó İóŞóÏú ÚóÕóÇäöí»</div><br>  (Whoever obeys me, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys me, disobeys Allah. Whoever obeys the Amir (leader, ruler), obeys me; and whoever disobeys the Amir, disobeys me.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä Êóæóáøóì İóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÜßó Úóáóíúåöãú ÍóİöíÙÇğ</div><br>  (But he who turns away, then We have not sent you as a watcher over them.) means, do not worry about him. Your job is only to convey, and whoever obeys you, he will acquire happiness and success and you will gain a similar reward to that he earns. As for the one who turns away from you, he will gain failure and loss and you will not carry a burden because of what he does. A Hadith states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú íõØöÚö Çááåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ İóŞóÏú ÑóÔóÏó¡ æóãóäú íóÚúÕö Çááåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ İóÅöäøóåõ áóÇ íóÖõÑøõ ÅöáøóÇ äóİúÓóå»</div><br>  (Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, will acquire guidance; and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, will only harm himself.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Foolishness of the Hypocrites</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæäó ØóÇÚóÉñ</div><br>  (They say: "We are obedient,''). Allah states that the hypocrites pretend to be loyal and obedient.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ÈóÑóÒõæÇú ãöäú ÚöäÏößó</div><br>  (but when they leave you), meaning, when they depart and are no longer with you,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóíøóÊó ØóÂÆöİóÉñ ãøöäúåõãú ÛóíúÑó ÇáøóĞöì ÊóŞõæáõ</div><br>  (a section of them spends all night in planning other than what you say). They plot at night among themselves for other than what they pretend when they are with you. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóßúÊõÈõ ãóÇ íõÈóíøöÊõæäó</div><br>  (But Allah records their nightly (plots).) meaning, He has full knowledge of their plots and records it through His command to His scribes, the angels who are responsible for recording the actions of the servants. This is a threat from Allah, stating that He knows what the hypocrites try to hide, their plotting in the night to defy the Messenger and oppose him, even though they pretend to be loyal and obedient to him. Allah will certainly punish them for this conduct. In a similar Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíöŞõæáõæäó ÂãóäøóÇ ÈöÇááøóåö æóÈöÇáÑøóÓõæáö æóÃóØóÚúäóÇ</div><br>  (They (hypocrites) say: "We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey,'') until the end of the Ayah. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÚúÑöÖú Úóäúåõãú</div><br>  (So turn aside from them) means, pardon them, be forbearing with them, do not punish them, do not expose them to the people and do not fear them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóæóßøóáú Úóáóì Çááøóåö æóßóİóì ÈöÇááøóåö æóßöíáÇğ </div><br>  (and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.) meaning, He is sufficient as Protector, Supporter and Helper for those who rely on Him and return to Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó íóÊóÏóÈøóÑõæäó ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäó æóáóæú ßóÇäó ãöäú ÚöäÏö ÛóíúÑö Çááøóåö áóæóÌóÏõæÇú İöíåö ÇÎúÊöáóÜİÇğ ßóËöíÑÇğ </div><br>  </div></body></html>
