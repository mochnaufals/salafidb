Allah created brilliant stars and rotating heavenly objects and planets, all made subservient. There are many plots of fertile land next to each other on earth, and gardens, solid mountains, lively oceans, with their waves smashing against each other, and spacious deserts. There are many live creatures and others that have died; and animals, plants and fruits that are similar in shape, but different in taste, scent, color and attributes. All praise is due to Allah the One and Only, Who created all types of creations, Who Alone will remain and last forever. It is He Who is unique in His Names and Attributes. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõÄúãöäõ ÃóßúËóÑõåõãú ÈöÇááøóåö ÅöáÇøó æóåõãú ãøõÔúÑößõæäó </div><br>  (And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners unto Him.) Ibn `Abbas commented, "They have a part of faith, for when they are asked, `Who created the heavens Who created the earth Who created the mountains' They say, `Allah did.' Yet, they associate others with Him in worship.'' Similar is said by Mujahid, `Ata, `Ikrimah, Ash-Sha`bi, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. In the Sahih, it is recorded that during the Hajj season, the idolators used to say in their Talbiyah: "Here we rush to Your service. You have no partners with You, except a partner with You whom You own but he owns not!'' Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáÔøöÑúßó áóÙõáúãñ ÚóÙöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm (wrong) indeed.) 31:13 This indeed is the greatest type of Shirk, associating others with Allah in worship. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "I said, `O Allah's Messenger! What is the greatest sin' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóäú ÊóÌúÚóáó ááåö äöÏøğÇ æóåõæó ÎóáóŞóß»</div><br>  (That you call a rival to Allah while He alone created you.)'' Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõÄúãöäõ ÃóßúËóÑõåõãú ÈöÇááøóåö ÅöáÇøó æóåõãú ãøõÔúÑößõæäó </div><br>  (And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners unto Him.) "This is the hypocrite; if he performs good deeds, he does so to show off with the people, and he is an idolator while doing this.'' Al-Hasan was referring to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó íõÎóÜÏöÚõæäó Çááøóåó æóåõæó ÎóÇÏöÚõåõãú æóÅöĞóÇ ŞóÇãõæÇú Åöáóì ÇáÕøóáóæÉö ŞóÇãõæÇú ßõÓóÇáóì íõÑóÂÁõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓó æóáÇó íóĞúßõÑõæäó Çááøóåó ÅöáÇøó ŞóáöíáÇğ </div><br>  (Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for As-Salah, they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allah but little.) 4:142 There is another type of hidden Shirk that most people are unaware of. Hammad bin Salamah narrated that `Asim bin Abi An-Najud said that `Urwah said, "Hudhayfah visited an ill man and saw a rope tied around his arm, so he ripped it off while reciting,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõÄúãöäõ ÃóßúËóÑõåõãú ÈöÇááøóåö ÅöáÇøó æóåõãú ãøõÔúÑößõæäó </div><br>  (And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners unto Him.) In a Hadith, from Ibn `Umar collected by At-Tirmidhi who said it was Hasan, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Íóáóİó ÈöÛóíúÑö Çááåö İóŞóÏú ÃóÔúÑóß»</div><br>  (He who swears by other than Allah, commits Shirk.) Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud and other scholars of Hadith narrated that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÑøõŞóì æóÇáÊøóãóÇÆöãó æóÇáÊøöæóáóÉó ÔöÑúß»</div><br>  (Verily, Ar-Ruqa, At-Tama'im and At-Tiwalah are all acts of Shirk.)  In another narration collected by Ahmad and Abu Dawud, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáØøöíóÑóÉõ ÔöÑúßñ æóãóÇ ãöäøóÇ ÅöáøóÇ¡ æóáóßöäøó Çááåó íõĞúåöÈõåõ ÈöÇáÊøóæóßøõá»</div><br>  (Verily, At-Tiyarah omen is Shirk; everyone might feel a glimpse of it, but Allah dissipates it with Tawakkul.)''
