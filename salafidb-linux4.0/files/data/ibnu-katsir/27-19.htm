Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÁóÇÊóíúäóÇ ÏóÇæõæÏó æóÓõáóíúãóÜäó ÚöáúãÇğ æóŞóÇáÇó ÇáúÍóãúÏõ áöáøóåö ÇáøóĞöì İóÖøóáóäóÇ Úóáóì ßóËöíÑò ãøöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (And indeed We gave knowledge to Dawud and Sulayman, and they both said: "All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has preferred us above many of His believing servants!'')   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóÑöËó ÓõáóíúãóÜäõ ÏóÇæõæÏó</div><br>  (And Sulayman inherited from Dawud.) means, in kingship and prophethood. What is meant here is not wealth, because if that were the case, Sulayman would not have been singled out from among the sons of Dawud, as Dawud had one hundred wives. Rather what is meant is the inheritance of kingship and prophethood, for the wealth of the Prophets cannot be inherited, as the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÍúäõ ãóÚóÇÔöÑó ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁö áóÇ äõæÑóËõ¡ ãóÇ ÊóÑóßúäóÇåõ İóåõæó ÕóÏóŞóÉ»</div><br>  (We Prophets cannot be inherited from; whatever we leave behind is charity.)

We have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from everything.) Here Sulayman was speaking of the blessings that Allah bestowed upon him, by giving him complete authority and power, whereby mankind, the Jinn and the birds were subjugated to him. He also knew the language of the birds and animals, which is something that had never been given to any other human being -- as far as we know from what Allah and His Messenger told us. Allah enabled Sulayman to understand what the birds said to one another as they flew through the air, and what the different kinds of animals said. Sulayman said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚõáøöãúäóÇ ãóäØöŞó ÇáØøóíúÑö æóÃõæÊöíäóÇ ãöä ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (We have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from everything.) i.e., all things that a king needs.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóÜĞóÇ áóåõæó ÇáúİóÖúáõ ÇáúãõÈöíäõ</div><br>  (This, verily, is an evident grace.) means, `this is clearly the blessings of Allah upon us.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍõÔöÑó áöÓúáóíúãóÜäó ÌõäõæÏõåõ ãöäó ÇáúÌöäøö æóÇáÅöäúÓ æóÇáØøóíúÑö İóåõãú íõæÒóÚõæäó </div><br>  (And there were gathered before Sulayman his hosts of Jinn and men, and birds, and they all were set in battle order.) means, all of Sulayman's troops of Jinn, men and birds were gathered together, and he rode with them in a display of might and glory, with people marching behind him, followed by the Jinn, and the birds flying above his head.

The first and the last of them were brought together, so that none of them would step out of place.
