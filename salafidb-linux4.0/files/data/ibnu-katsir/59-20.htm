Most of them, nay, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The color of the face of the Messenger of Allah underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal to pronounce Adhan. Bilal pronounced Adhan and Iqamah, and the Prophet led the prayer. He then addressed them, first reciting,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÇÊøóŞõæÇú ÑóÈøóßõãõ ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞóßõãú ãøöä äøóİúÓò æóÍöÏóÉò</div><br>  (O mankind! Have Taqwa of your Lord, Who created you from a single person... ) (4:1), until the end of the Ayah. Then he recited the Ayah that is in Surat Al-Hashr:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáúÊóäÙõÑú äóİúÓñ ãøóÇ ŞóÏøóãóÊú áöÛóÏò</div><br>  (and let every person look to what he has sent forth for tomorrow,'') He then said, "A man donated his Dinar, his Dirham, from his clothes, from his Sa` of wheat, from his Sa` of dates'' -- until he said -- "even if it was half a date.'' Then a person among the Ansar came there with a moneybag, which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, his hands could not lift it. Then the people followed continuously, until I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes. I saw the face of the Messenger radiate with pleasure, like gold. The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Óóäøó İöí ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãö ÓõäøóÉğ ÍóÓóäóÉğ İóáóåõ ÃóÌúÑõåóÇ æóÃóÌúÑõ ãóäú Úóãöáó ÈöåóÇ ÈóÚúÏóåõ¡ ãöäú ÛóíúÑö Ãóäú íõäúŞóÕó ãöäú ÃõÌõæÑöåöãú ÔóíúÁñ¡ æóãóäú Óóäøó İöí ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãö ÓõäøóÉğ ÓóíøöÆóÉğ ßóÇäó Úóáóíúåö æöÒúÑõåóÇ æóæöÒúÑõ ãóäú Úóãöáó ÈöåóÇ¡ ãöäú ÛóíúÑö Ãóäú íõäúŞóÕó ãöäú ÃóæúÒóÇÑöåöãú ÔóíúÁ»</div><br>  (He who sets a good example in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards.

Muslim recorded this Hadith via the chain of Shu`bah. Therefore, Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó</div><br>  (O you who believe!

This is why Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúİóÜÓöŞõæäó</div><br>  (Those are the rebellious.) referring to those who rebel against obedience to Allah, who will earn destruction on the Day of Resurrection and failure upon their return,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó Êõáúåößõãú Ãóãúæóáõßõãú æóáÇó ÃóæúáóÜÏõßõãú Úóä ĞößúÑö Çááøóåö æóãóä íóİúÚóáú Ğóáößó İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÎóÜÓöÑõæäó </div><br>  (O you who believe!
