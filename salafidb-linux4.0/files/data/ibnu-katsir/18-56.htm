Nothing stopped them from following the truth except their demand to witness with their own eyes the punishment which they were being warned about. As some of them said to their Prophet:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÓúŞöØú ÚóáóíúäóÇ ßöÓóİÇğ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö Åöä ßõäÊó ãöäó ÇáÕøóÜÏöŞöíäó </div><br>  (So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!) 26:187, Others said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÆúÊöäóÇ ÈöÚóĞóÇÈö Çááøóåö Åöä ßõäÊó ãöäó ÇáÕøóÜÏöŞöíäó</div><br>  (Bring Allah's torment upon us if you are one of the truthful.) 29:29 The Quraysh said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõãøó Åöä ßóÇäó åóÜĞóÇ åõæó ÇáúÍóŞøó ãöäú ÚöäÏößó İóÃóãúØöÑú ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÍöÌóÇÑóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö Ãóæö ÇÆúÊöäóÇ ÈöÚóĞóÇÈò Ãóáöíãò</div><br>  (O Allah!

Verily, you are a mad man! Why do you not bring angels to us if you are of the truthful'') 15:6-7. There are other Ayat refering to the same thing. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Ãóä ÊóÃúÊöíóåõãú ÓõäøóÉõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó</div><br>  (except that the ways of the ancients be repeated with them,) meaning, their overwhelming punishment, destroying every last one of them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú íóÃúÊöíóåõãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ ŞõÈõáÇğ</div><br>  (or the torment be brought to them face to face.) they see it with their own eyes, being directly confronted with it.

Then Allah tells us about the disbelievers who argue:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÇáúÈóÜØöáö áöíõÏúÍöÖõæÇú Èöåö ÇáúÍóŞøó</div><br>  (with falsehood, in order to refute the truth thereby.) they try to weaken the truth that the Messengers brought, but they cannot achieve that.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóÎóĞõæÇú ÁÇíóÇÊöì æóãóÇ ÃõäúĞöÑõæÇú åõÒõæÇğ</div><br>  (And they take My Ayat and that which they are warned for jest!) they take the proof, evidence and miracles sent with the Messengers to warn them, and make them fear the punishment;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõÒõæÇğ</div><br>  (as a jest and mockery) and they make fun of them, which is the worst type of disbelief.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäú ÃóÙúáóãõ ãöãøóä ĞõßøöÑó ÈöÜóÇíöÜÊö ÑóÈøöåö İóÃóÚúÑóÖó ÚóäúåóÇ æóäóÓöìó ãóÇ ŞóÏøóãóÊú íóÏóÇåõ ÅöäøóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú ÃóßöäøóÉğ Ãóä íóİúŞóåõæåõ æóİöì ÁóÇĞóÇäöåöãú æóŞúÑÇğ æóÅöä ÊóÏúÚõåõãú Åöáóì ÇáúåõÏóì İóáóäú íóåúÊóÏõæÇú ÅöĞÇğ ÃóÈóÏÇğ - æóÑóÈøõßó ÇáúÛóİõæÑõ Ğõæ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÉö áóæú íõÄóÇÎöĞõåõã ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈõæÇú áóÚóÌøóáó áóåõãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó Èóá áøóåõã ãøóæúÚöÏñ áøóä íóÌöÏõæÇú ãöä Ïõæäöåö ãóæúÆöáÇğ </div><br>  </div></body></html>
