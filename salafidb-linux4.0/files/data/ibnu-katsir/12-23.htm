She called him to do an evil act with her, because she loved him very much. Yusuf was very handsome, filled with manhood and beauty. She beautified herself for him, closed the doors and called him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáóÊú åóíúÊó áóßó</div><br>  (and (she) said: "Come on, O you.'')

This was said by Mujahid, As-Suddi, Muhammad bin Ishaq and several others. The scholars differ in their recitation of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóíúÊó áóßó</div><br>  (Hayta Laka), whereby Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several other scholars said that it means that she was calling him to herself. Al-Bukhari said; "Ikrimah said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóíúÊó áóßó</div><br>  (Hayta Laka') means, `come on, O you', in the Aramaic language.'' Al-Bukhari collected this statement from `Ikrimah without a chain of narration. Other scholars read it with the meaning, `I am ready for you'. Ibn `Abbas, Abu `Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami, Abu Wa'il, `Ikrimah and Qatadah were reported to have read this part of the Ayah this way and explained it in the manner we mentioned, as `I am ready for you'.  </div></body></html>
