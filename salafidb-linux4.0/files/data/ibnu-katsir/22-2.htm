And the mountains will be powdered to dust.) 56:4-5 It was said that this earthquake will come at the end of the life span of this world, at the outset of the Hour. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Alqamah commented on Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÒóáúÒóáóÉó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÔóìúÁñ ÚóÙöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, the earthquake of the Hour (of Judgement) is a terrible thing.) "Before the Hour.'' Others said that this refers to the terror, fear, earthquakes and chaos that will happen on the Day of Resurrection, in the arena (of Judgement), after the resurrection from the graves. This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir, who took the following Hadiths as evidence: Imam Ahmad recorded that `Imran bin Husayn said that when the Messenger of Allah was on one of his journeys and some of his Companions had fallen behind, he raised his voice and recited these two Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÇÊøóŞõæÇú ÑóÈøóßõãú Åöäøó ÒóáúÒóáóÉó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÔóìúÁñ ÚóÙöíãñ - íóæúãó ÊóÑóæúäóåóÇ ÊóĞúåóáõ ßõáøõ ãõÑúÖöÚóÉò ÚóãøóÂ ÃóÑúÖóÚóÊú æóÊóÖóÚõ ßõáøõ ĞóÇÊö Íóãúáò ÍóãúáóåóÇ æóÊóÑóì ÇáäøóÇÓó ÓõßóÜÑóì æóãóÇ åõã ÈöÓõßóÜÑóì æóáóÜßöäøó ÚóĞóÇÈó Çááøóåö ÔóÏöíÏñ </div><br>  (O mankind!

The Day you shall see it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling, and every pregnant one will drop her load, and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.) When his Companions heard that, they hastened to catch up with him, because they knew that he wanted to say something. When they reached him, he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊóÏúÑõæäó Ãóíøõ íóæúãò ĞóÇßó¡ ĞóÇßó íóæúãõ íõäóÇÏóì ÂÏóãõ Úóáóíúåö ÇáÓøóáóÇãõ¡ İóíõäóÇÏöíåö ÑóÈøõåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó¡ İóíóŞõæáõ: íóÇ ÂÏóãõ ÇÈúÚóËú ÈóÚúËóßó Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ İóíóŞõæáõ: íóÇ ÑóÈøö æóãóÇ ÈóÚúËõ ÇáäøóÇÑö¿ İóíóŞõæáõ: ãöäú ßõáøö Ãóáúİò ÊöÓúÚõãöÇÆóÉò æóÊöÓúÚóÉñ æóÊöÓúÚõæäó İöí ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ æóæóÇÍöÏñ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (Do you know what Day that is That is the Day when Adam will be called. His Lord will call him and will say: "O Adam, send forth (those of your progeny) who are to be sent to the Fire.'' He will say, "O Lord, how many are to be sent to the Fire'' He will say, "From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine will be in the Fire and one will be in Paradise.'') His Companions were filled with despair and stopped smiling. When he saw that, he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÈúÔöÑõæÇ æóÇÚúãóáõæÇ¡ İóæóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓõ ãõÍóãøóÏò ÈöíóÏöåö Åöäøóßõãú áóãóÚó ÎóáöíŞóÊóíúäö ãóÇ ßóÇäóÊóÇ ãóÚó ÔóíúÁò ŞóØøõ ÅöáøóÇ ßóËøóÑóÊóÇåõ íóÃúÌõæÌõ æóãóÃúÌõæÌõ¡ æóãóäú åóáóßó ãöäú Èóäöí ÂÏóãó æóÈóäöí ÅöÈúáöíÓ»</div><br>  (Be of good cheer and strive hard, for by the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, you will be counted with two creations who are of immense numbers, Ya'juj and Ma'juj, and those who have already died of the progeny of Adam and the progeny of Iblis.) Then they felt happier, and he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÚúãóáõæÇ æóÃóÈúÔöÑõæÇ¡ İóæóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓõ ãõÍóãøóÏò ÈöíóÏöåö¡ ãóÇ ÃóäúÊõãú İöí ÇáäøóÇÓö ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇáÔøóÇãóÉö İöí ÌóäúÈö ÇáúÈóÚöíÑö Ãóæö ÇáÑøóŞúãóÉö İöí ĞöÑóÇÚö ÇáÏøóÇÈøóÉ»</div><br>  (Strive hard and be of good cheer, for by the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, in comparison to mankind you are like a mole on the flank of a camel or a mark on the foreleg of a beast.) This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and by An-Nasa'i in the Book of Tafsir in their Sunans. At-Tirmidhi said, "It is Hasan Sahih.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Version of this Hadith</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  At-Tirmidhi recorded from `Imran bin Husayn that when the words,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÇÊøóŞõæÇú ÑóÈøóßõãõ</div><br>  (O mankind!

He will say, "O Lord, how many are to be sent to the Fire'' He will say, "From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine will be in the Fire and one will be in Paradise.'') The Muslims started to weep, then the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÇÑöÈõæÇ æóÓóÏøöÏõæÇ¡ İóÅöäøóåóÇ áóãú Êóßõäú äõÈõæøóÉñ ŞóØøõ ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇäó Èóíúäó íóÏóíúåóÇ ÌóÇåöáöíøóÉñ¡ ŞóÇáó: İóíõÄúÎóĞõ ÇáúÚóÏóÏõ ãöäó ÇáúÌóÇåöáöíøóÉö¡ İóÅöäú ÊóãøóÊú¡ æóÅöáøóÇ ßõãøöáóÊú ãöäó ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞöíäó¡ æóãóÇ ãóËóáõßõãú æóãóËóáõ ÇáúÃõãóãö ÅöáøóÇ ßóãóËóáö ÇáÑøóŞúãóÉö İöí ĞöÑóÇÚö ÇáÏøóÇÈøóÉö¡ Ãóæú ßóÇáÔøóÇãóÉö İöí ÌóäúÈö ÇáúÈóÚöíÑ»</div><br>  (Be close in your rank and be straight forward, for there was never any Prophet but there was a time of ignorance just before his advent, so the number will be taken from that time of ignorance, and if that is not enough, it will be made up from the hypocrites.

Then he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí áóÃóÑúÌõæ Ãóäú ÊóßõæäõæÇ ÑõÈõÚó Ãóåúáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (I hope that you will be a quarter of the people of Paradise.)

They said, "Allahu Akbar!'' Then he the narrator said, "I do not know if he said two-thirds or not.'' This was also recorded by Imam Ahmad. Then At-Tirmidhi also said, "This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.'' In his Tafsir, under this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id said, "The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö: íóÇ ÂÏóãõ¡ İóíóŞõæáõ: áóÈøóíúßó ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÓóÚúÏóíúßó¡ İóíõäóÇÏóì ÈöÕóæúÊò: Åöäøó Çááåó íóÃúãõÑõßó Ãóäú ÊõÎúÑöÌó ãöäú ĞõÑøöíøóÊößó ÈóÚúËğÇ Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ ŞóÇáó: íóÇ ÑóÈøö æóãóÇ ÈóÚúËõ ÇáäøóÇÑö¿ ŞóÇáó: ãöäú ßõáøö Ãóáúİò ÃõÑóÇåõ ŞóÇáó ÊöÓúÚõãöÇÆóÉò æóÊöÓúÚóÉñ æóÊöÓúÚõæäó¡ İóÍöíäóÆöĞò ÊóÖóÚõ ÇáúÍóÇãöáõ ÍóãúáóåóÇ æóíóÔöíÈõ ÇáúæóáöíÏõ</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóì ÇáäøóÇÓó ÓõßóÜÑóì æóãóÇ åõã ÈöÓõßóÜÑóì æóáóÜßöäøó ÚóĞóÇÈó Çááøóåö ÔóÏöíÏñ</div><br>  (On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will say: "O Adam.''

At that time every pregnant female will drop her load and children will turn grey. (and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.)) That will be so difficult for mankind to bear that their faces will change.

We said "Allahu Akbar!'' Then he said, (A third of the people of Paradise.) We said, "Allahu Akbar!'' Then he said, (One half of the people of Paradise.) We said: `Allahu Akbar!'' Al-Bukhari also recorded this elsewhere. It was also recorded by Muslim, and An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. The Hadiths and reports about the terrors of the Day of Resurrection are very many, and this is not the place to quote them all.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÒóáúÒóáóÉó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÔóìúÁñ ÚóÙöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, the earthquake of the Hour is a terrible thing.) means, a serious matter, a terrifying crisis, a horrendous event.
