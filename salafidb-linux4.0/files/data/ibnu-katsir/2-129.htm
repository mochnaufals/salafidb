"Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them Your verses and instruct them in the Book (this Qur'an), and purify them. Verily, You are the Mighty, the Wise.'')</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Ibrahim's Supplication that Allah sends the Prophet</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah mentioned Ibrahim's supplication for the benefit of the people of the Sacred Area (to grant them security and provision), and it was perfected by invoking Allah to send a Messenger from his offspring. This accepted supplication, from Ibrahim, conformed with Allah's appointed destiny that Muhammad be sent as a Messenger among the Ummiyyin and to all non-Arabs, among the Jinns and mankind.  Hence, Ibrahim was the first person to mention the Prophet to the people. Ever since, Muhammad was known to the people, until the last Prophet was sent among the Children of Israel, Jesus the son of Mary, who mentioned Muhammad by name. Jesus addressed the Children of Israel saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì ÑóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö Åöáóíúßõã ãøõÕóÏøöŞÇğ áøöãóÇ Èóíúäó íóÏóìøó ãöäó ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉö æóãõÈóÔøöÑÇğ ÈöÑóÓõæáò íóÃúÊöì ãöä ÈóÚúÏöì ÇÓúãõåõ ÃóÍúãóÏõ</div><br>  (I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming what is before me in the Tawrah, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad) (61:6)  This is why the Prophet said ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÏóÚúæóÉõ ÃóÈöí ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãó æóÈõÔúÑóì ÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäö ãóÑúíóã»</div><br>  (The supplication of my father Ibrahim and the glad tidings brought forth by Jesus the son of Mary.)  The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÑóÃóÊú Ãõãøöí Ãóäøóåõ ÎóÑóÌó ãöäúåóÇ äõæÑñ ÃóÖóÇÁóÊú áóåõ ŞõÕõæÑõ ÇáÔøóÇã»</div><br>  (My mother saw a light that went out of her and radiated the palaces of Ash-Sham.)  It was said that the Prophet's mother saw this vision when she was pregnant with, narrated this vision to her people, and the story became popular among them. The light mentioned in the Hadith appeared in Ash-Sham (Greater Syria), testifying to what will later occur when the Prophet's religion will be firmly established in Ash-Sham area. This is why by the end of time, Ash-Sham will be a refuge for Islam and its people. Also, Jesus the son of Mary will descend in Ash-Sham, next to the eastern white minaret in Damascus. The Two Sahihs stated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÒóÇáõ ØóÇÆöİóÉñ ãöäú ÃõãøóÊöí ÙóÇåöÑöíäó Úóáóì ÇáúÍóŞøö áóÇ íóÖõÑøõåõãú ãóäú ÎóĞóáóåõãú æóáóÇ ãóäú ÎóÇáóİóåõãú ÍóÊøóì íóÃúÊöíó ÃóãúÑõ Çááåö æóåõãú ßóĞóáöß»</div><br>  æİí ÕÍíÍ ÇáÈÎÇÑí   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóåõãú ÈÇáÔøóÇã»</div><br>  (There will always be a group of my Ummah who will be on the truth, undeterred by those who fail or oppose them, until the command of Allah comes while they are on this.)  Al-Bukhari added in his Sahih, (And they will reside in Ash-Sham.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of Al-Kitab wal-Hikmah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÚóáøöãõåõãõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (and instruct them in the Book) meaning, Al-Qur'an,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÍößúÜÜãóÉö</div><br>  (and Al-Hikmah) meaning, the Sunnah, as Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Abu Malik asserted. It was also said that `Al-Hikmah', means `comprehension in the religion', and both meanings are correct. `Ali bin Abi Talhah said, that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÒóßøöíåöãú</div><br>  (and purify them) means, "With the obedience of Allah.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßó ÃóäÊó ÇáÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáÍóßöíãõ</div><br>  (Verily, You are the Mighty, the Wise).  This Ayah stated that Allah is able to do anything, and nothing escapes His ability. He is Wise in His decisions, His actions, and He puts everything in its rightful place due to His perfect knowledge, wisdom and justice.  </div></body></html>
