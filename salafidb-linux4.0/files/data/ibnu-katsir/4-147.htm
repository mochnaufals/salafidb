This includes being friends and associates of the disbelievers, advising them, being intimate with them and exposing the secrets of the believers to them. In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóÊøóÎöĞö ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó ãöä Ïõæäö ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó æóãóä íóİúÚóáú Ğóáößó İóáóíúÓó ãöäó Çááøóåö İöí ÔóìúÁò ÅöáÇó Ãóä ÊóÊøóŞõæÇú ãöäúåõãú ÊõŞóÜÉğ æóíõÍóĞøöÑúßõãõ Çááøóåõ äóİúÓóåõ</div><br>  (Let not the believers take the disbelievers as friends instead of the believers, and whoever does that, will never be helped by Allah in any way, except if you indeed fear a danger from them. And Allah warns you against Himself). meaning, He warns you against His punishment if you fall into what He has prohibited. This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊõÑöíÏõæäó Ãóä ÊóÌúÚóáõæÇú ááøóåö Úóáóíúßõãú ÓõáúØóÇäÇğ ãøõÈöíäÇğ</div><br>  (Do you wish to offer Allah a manifest Sultan against yourselves) meaning, proof against you that warrants receiving His torment. Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Ibn `Abbas commented;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓõáúØóÇäÇğ ãøõÈöíäÇğ</div><br>  (manifest Sultan), "The word Sultan in the Qur'an means proof. '' There is an authentic chain of narration for this statement, which is also the saying of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and An-Nadr bin `Arabi. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Hypocrites and the Friends of Disbelievers are in the Lowest Depth of the Fire, Unless they Repent</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then states that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó İöì ÇáÏøóÑúßö ÇáÇøñÓúİóáö ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö</div><br>  (Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire;) on the Day of Resurrection due to their tremendous Kufr.

Other scholars said that the Fire has ever lower depths just as Paradise had ever higher grades. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó İöì ÇáÏøóÑúßö ÇáÇøñÓúİóáö ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö</div><br>  (Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths (grade) of the Fire), "Inside coffins of Fire that surround them, for they are closed and sealed in them.''  Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that when Ibn Mas`ud was asked about the hypocrites, he said, "They will be placed in coffins made of fire and they will be closed in them in the lowest depth of the Fire.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóä ÊóÌöÏó áóåõãú äóÕöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (no helper will you find for them. ) to save them from their misery and painful torment. Allah then states that whoever among the hypocrites repents in this life, Allah will accept his repentance and sorrow, if his repentance were sincere and he then follows it by performing righteous deeds, all the while depending on his Lord.
