Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÕøóÜÈöÑöíäó</div><br>  ((They are) those who are patient) while performing acts of obedience and abandoning the prohibitions.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÕøóÜÏöŞöíäó</div><br>  (those who are true) concerning their proclamation of faith, by performing the difficult deeds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúŞóÜäöÊöíäó</div><br>  (and obedient) meaning, they submit and obey Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó</div><br>  (those who spend) from their wealth on all the acts of obedience they were commanded, being kind to kith and kin, helping the needy, and comforting the destitute.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõÓúÊóÛúİöÑöíäó ÈöÇáÇøñÓúÍóÇÑö</div><br>  (and those who pray and beg Allah's pardon in the last hours of the night) and this testifies to the virtue of seeking Allah's forgiveness in the latter part of the night. It was reported that when Ya`qub said to his children,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Óóæúİó ÃóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõ áóßõãú ÑóÈøöì</div><br>  (I will ask my Lord for forgiveness for you) 12:98 he waited until the latter part of the night to say his supplication.  Furthermore, the Two Sahihs, the Musnad and Sunan collections recorded through several Companions that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóäúÒöáõ Çááåõ ÊóÈóÇÑóßó æóÊóÚóÇáì İöí ßõáøö áóíúáóÉò Åöáì ÓóãóÇÁö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ Íöíäó íóÈúŞóì ËõáõËõ Çááøóíúáö ÇáúÂÎöÑõ¡ İóíóŞõæáõ: åóáú ãöäú ÓóÇÆöáò İóÃõÚúØöíóåõ¿ åóáú ãöäú ÏóÇÚò İóÃóÓúÊóÌöíÈó áóåõ¿ åóáú ãöäú ãõÓúÊóÛúİöÑò İóÃóÛúİöÑó áóåõ¿»</div><br>  (Every night, when the last third of it remains, our Lord, the Blessed, the Superior, descends to the lowest heaven saying, "Is there anyone to ask Me, so that I may grant him his request Is there anyone to invoke Me, so that I may respond to his invocation Is there anyone seeking My forgiveness, so that I may forgive him'')  The Two Sahihs recorded that `A'ishah said, "The Messenger of Allah performed Witr during the first part, the middle and latter parts of the night. Then, later (in his life), he would perform it (only) during the latter part.'' `Abdullah bin `Umar used to pray during the night and would ask, "O Nafi`! Is it the latter part of the night yet'' and if Nafi` said, "Yes,'' Ibn `Umar would start supplicating to Allah and seeking His forgiveness until dawn. This Hadith was collected by Ibn Abi Hatim.  </div></body></html>
