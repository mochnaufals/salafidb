When the Prophet heard of this statement, he summoned them and asked them if they made this statement and they answered `Yes.' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áßöäøöí ÃóÕõæãõ æóÃõİúØöÑõ¡ æóÃõÕóáøöí¡ æóÃóäóÇãõ¡ æóÃóäúßöÍõ ÇáäøöÓóÇÁó¡ İóãóäú ÃóÎóĞó ÈöÓõäøóÊöí İóåõæó ãöäøöí¡ æóãóäú áóãú íóÃúÎõĞú ÈöÓõäøóÊöí İóáóíúÓó ãöäøöí»</div><br>  (I fast and break my fast, pray and sleep, and marry women. Whoever follows my Sunnah is of me, and whoever abandons my Sunnah is not of me.)'' Ibn Abi Hatim also collected this Hadith. Ibn Marduwyah recorded that Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas narrated a similar Hadith. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that `A'ishah said that some of the Companions asked the wives of the Prophet about the acts of worship that he performed in private. One of them said, "I will not eat meat,'' another said, "I will not marry women,'' while the third said, "I will not sleep on the bed.'' When the Prophet heard this statement, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÈóÇáõ ÃóŞúæóÇãò íóŞõæáõ ÃóÍóÏõåõãú ßóĞóÇ æóßóĞóÇ¡ áßöäøöí ÃóÕõæãõ æóÃõİúØöÑõ¡ æóÃóäóÇãõ æóÃóŞõæãõ¡ æóÂßõáõ ÇááøóÍúãó¡ æóÃóÊóÒóæøóÌõ ÇáäøöÓóÇÁó¡ İóãóäú ÑóÛöÈó Úóäú ÓõäøóÊöí İóáóíúÓó ãöäøöí»</div><br>  (What is the matter with some people who said such and such I fast and break the fast, sleep and wake to stand to pray, eat meat, and marry women. He who is not pleased with my Sunnah is not of me.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÚúÊóÏõæÇú</div><br>  (and transgress not.) means, do not exaggerate and make it hard for yourselves by prohibiting the permissible things. Do not transgress the limits by excessively indulging in the permissible matters; only use of it what satisfies your need; and do not fall into extravagance. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æßõáõæÇú æóÇÔúÑóÈõæÇú æóáÇó ÊõÓúÑöİõæÇú</div><br>  (And eat and drink but waste not by extravagance.)7:31, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÂ ÃóäİóŞõæÇú áóãú íõÓúÑöİõæÇú æóáóãú íóŞúÊõÑõæÇú æóßóÇäó Èóíúäó Ğóáößó ŞóæóÇãÇğ </div><br>  (And those, who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor miserly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes).)25:67 So Allah legislated a medium way between those who are extreme and those who fall into shortcomings, and it does not allow excessive application, nor lack of application. This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊõÍóÑøöãõæÇú ØóíøöÈóÜÊö ãóÂ ÃóÍóáøó Çááøóåõ áóßõãú æóáÇó ÊóÚúÊóÏõæÇú Åöäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúãõÚúÊóÏöíäó</div><br>  (Make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful to you, and transgress not.
