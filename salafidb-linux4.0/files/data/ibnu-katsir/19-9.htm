He became extremely overjoyed and asked how this child would be born to him, and in what manner he would come. This was particularly amazing because his wife was an old woman who was barren and had not given birth to any children in her entire life. Even Zakariyya himself had become old and advanced in years, his bones had become feeble and thin, and he had no potent semen or vigor for sexual intercourse. The Answer of the Angel   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó</div><br>  (He said:) That is, the angel, in his response to Zakariyya and his was amazement.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó ŞóÇáó ÑóÈøõßó åõæó Úóáóìøó åóíøöäñ</div><br>  ("Thus says your Lord: `It is easy for Me...''') Meaning the birth of the son will be from you and from this wife of yours and not from any other (woman).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóíøöäñ</div><br>  (easy) Meaning, it is simple and easy for Allah to do. Then he (the angel) mentioned to him that which is more amazing than what he was asking about.
