If You would show me that with which they are threatened.) meaning, `if You punish them while I am witnessing that, then do not cause me to be one of them.' As was said in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÅöĞóÇ ÃóÑóÏúÊó ÈöŞóæãò İöÊúäóÉğ İóÊóæİøóäöí Åöáóíúßó ÛóíúÑó ãóİúÊõæä»</div><br>  (If You want to test people, then take me to You cause me to die without having to undergo the test.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóÇ Úóáóì Ãóä äøõÑöíóßó ãóÇ äóÚöÏõåõãú áóŞóÜÏöÑõæäó </div><br>  (And indeed We are able to show you that with which We have threatened them.) means, `if We willed, We could show you the punishment and test that We will send upon them.' Then Allah shows him the best way to behave when mixing with people, which is to treat kindly the one who treats him badly, so as to soften his heart and turn his enmity to friendship, and to turn his hatred to love. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúİóÚú ÈöÇáøóÊöì åöìó ÃóÍúÓóäõ ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÉó</div><br>  (Repel evil with that which is better. ) This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúİóÚú ÈöÇáøóÊöì åöìó ÃóÍúÓóäõ İóÅöĞóÇ ÇáøóĞöì Èóíúäóßó æóÈóíúäóåõ ÚóÏóÇæóÉñ ßóÃóäøóåõ æóáöìøñ ÍóãöíãñæóãóÇ íõáóŞøóÇåóÇ ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÕóÈóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient) 41:34-35. meaning, nobody will be helped or inspired to follow this advice or attain this quality,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÕóÈóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (except those who are patient) meaning, those who patiently bear people's insults and bad treatment and deal with them in a good manner when they are on the receiving end of bad treatment from them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõáóŞøóÇåóÂ ÅöáÇøó Ğõæ ÍóÙøö ÚóÙöíãò</div><br>  (and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion) means, in this world and the Hereafter. And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõáú ÑøóÈøö ÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ãöäú åóãóÒóÇÊö ÇáÔøóíÜØöíäö </div><br>  (And say: "My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings of the Shayatin.'') Allah commanded him to seek refuge with Him from the Shayatin, because no trick could help you against them and you cannot protect yourself by being kind to them. We have already stated, when discussing Isti`adhah (seeking refuge), that the Messenger of Allah used to say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÚõæĞõ ÈöÇááåö ÇáÓøóãöíÚö ÇáúÚóáöíãö ãöäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäö ÇáÑøóÌöíãö ãöäú åóãúÒöåö æóäóİúÎöåö æóäóİúËöå»</div><br>  (I seek refuge with Allah, the All-Hearing, All-Seeing, from the accursed Shayatin, from his whisperings, evil suggestions and insinuations.) His saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ÑóÈøö Ãóä íóÍúÖõÑõæäö </div><br>  ("And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.'') means, in any issue of my life. So we are commanded to mention Allah at the beginning of any undertaking, in order to ward off the Shayatin at the time of eating, intercourse, slaughtering animals for food, etc. Abu Dawud recorded that the Messenger of Allah used to say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó Åöäøöí ÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ãöäó ÇáúåóÑóãö¡ æóÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ãöäó ÇáúåóÏúãö æóãöäó ÇáúÛóÑóŞö¡ æóÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ãöäú Ãóäú íóÊóÎóÈøóØóäöí ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäõ ÚöäúÏó ÇáúãóæúÊ»</div><br>  (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from old age, I seek refuge with You from being crushed or drowned, and I seek refuge with you from being assaulted by the Shayatin at the time of death.)  </div></body></html>
