Qatadah said: "A piece of the heaven.'' As-Suddi said: "A punishment from heaven.'' This is like what the Quraysh said, as Allah tells us:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú áóä äøõÄúãöäó áóßó ÍóÊøóì ÊóİúÌõÑó áóäóÇ ãöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö íóäúÈõæÚğÇ </div><br>  (And they say: "We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us) until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÊõÓúŞöØó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁó ßóãóÇ ÒóÚóãúÊó ÚóáóíúäóÇ ßöÓóİğÇ Ãóæú ÊóÃúÊöìó ÈöÇááøóåö æóÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö ŞóÈöíáÇğ </div><br>  (Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face.'') (17:90-92)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ŞóÇáõæÇú Çááøóåõãøó Åöä ßóÇäó åóÜĞóÇ åõæó ÇáúÍóŞøó ãöäú ÚöäÏößó İóÃóãúØöÑú ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÍöÌóÇÑóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö</div><br>  (And (remember) when they said: "O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky....'') (8:32). Similarly, these ignorant disbelievers said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÓúŞöØú ÚóáóíúäóÇ ßöÓóİÇğ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö</div><br>  (So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÑóÈøöì ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöãóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (He said: "My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.'') means, `Allah knows best about you, and if you deserve that, He will punish you therewith, and He will not treat you unjustly.' So this is what happened to them -- as they asked for -- an exact recompense. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóĞøóÈõæåõ İóÃóÎóĞóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈõ íóæúãö ÇáÙøõáøóÉö Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÚóĞóÇÈó íóæúãò ÚóÙöíãò </div><br>  (But they denied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) This is what they asked for, when they asked for a part of the heaven to fall upon them. Allah made their punishment in the form of intense heat which overwhelmed them for seven days, and nothing could protect them from it. Then He sent a cloud to shade them, so they ran towards it to seek its shade from the heat. When all of them had gathered underneath it, Allah sent sparks of fire and flames and intense heat upon them, and caused the earth to convulse beneath them, and He sent against them a mighty Sayhah which destroyed their souls. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÚóĞóÇÈó íóæúãò ÚóÙöíãò</div><br>  (Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Allah has mentioned how they were destroyed in three places in the Qur'an, in each of which it is described in a manner which fits the context. In Surat Al-A`raf He says that the earthquake seized them, and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes. This was because they said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóäõÎúÑöÌóäøóßó íÜÔõÚóíúÈõ æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ãóÚóßó ãöä ŞóÑúíóÊöäóÂ Ãóæú áóÊóÚõæÏõäøó İöí ãöáøóÊöäóÇ</div><br>  ("We shall certainly drive you out, O Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you (all) shall return to our religion.'') (7:88). They had sought to scare the Prophet of Allah and those who followed him, so they were seized by the earthquake. In Surah Hud, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÎóĞóÊö ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú ÇáÕøóíúÍóÉõ</div><br>  (And As-Sayhah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). This was because they mocked the Allah's Prophet when they said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÕóáóæóÊõßó ÊóÃúãõÑõßó Ãóä äøóÊúÑõßó ãóÇ íóÚúÈõÏõ ÁÇÈóÇÄõäóÂ Ãóæú Ãóä äøóİúÚóáó İöì ÃóãúæóÇáöäóÇ ãóÇ äóÔóÄõÇ Åöäøóßó áÇøäÊó ÇáúÍóáöíãõ ÇáÑøóÔöíÏõ</div><br>  ("Does your Salah command that we give up what our fathers used to worship, or that we give up doing what we like with our property Verily, you are the forbearer, right-minded!'') (11:87). They had said this in a mocking, sarcastic tone, so it was befitting that the Sayhah should come and silence them, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÎóĞóÊúåõãõ ÇáÕøóíúÍóÉõ</div><br>  (So As-Saihah overtook them) (15:73).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÎóĞóÊö ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú ÇáÕøóíúÍóÉõ</div><br>  (And As-Saihah seized the wrongdoers) (11:94). And here, they said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÓúŞöØú ÚóáóíúäóÇ ßöÓóİÇğ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö</div><br>  (So, cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us,) in a stubborn and obstinate manner. So, it was fitting that something they never thought would happen should befall them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÎóĞóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈõ íóæúãö ÇáÙøõáøóÉö Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÚóĞóÇÈó íóæúãò ÚóÙöíãò</div><br>  (so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.) Muhammad bin Jarir narrated from Yazid Al-Bahili: "I asked Ibn `Abbas about this Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÎóĞóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈõ íóæúãö ÇáÙøõáøóÉö</div><br>  (so the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. ) He said: `Allah sent upon them thunder and intense heat, and it terrified them so they entered their houses and it pursued them to the innermost parts of their houses and terrified them further, and they ran fleeing from their houses into the fields. Then Allah sent upon them clouds which shaded them from the sun, and they found it cool and pleasant, so they called out to one another until they had all gathered beneath the cloud, then Allah sent fire upon them.' Ibn `Abbas said, `That was the torment of the Day of Shadow, indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.'''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöí Ğóáößó áÃóíóÉğ æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÃóßúËóÑõåõãú ãøõÄúãöäöíäó - æóÅöäøó ÑóÈøóßó áóåõæó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáÑøóÍöíãõ </div><br>  (Verily, in this is an Ayah, yet most of them are not believers. And verily, your Lord, He is truly, the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.) (26:8-9) meaning, He is All-Mighty in His punishment of the disbelievers, and Most Merciful towards His believing servants.  </div></body></html>
