He realized the virtue of Prophet Yusuf, recognized his knowledge in the interpretation of dreams and valued his good conduct with his subjects in his country. The king said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÆúÊõæäöì Èöåö</div><br>  (Bring him to me.) `Release him from prison and bring him to me.' When the king's emissary came to Yusuf and conveyed the news of his imminent release, Yusuf refused to leave the prison until the king and his subjects declare his innocence and the integrity of his honor, denouncing the false accusation that the wife of the `Aziz made against him. He wanted them to know that sending him to prison was an act of injustice and aggression, not that he committed an offense that warranted it. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÑúÌöÚú Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó</div><br>  (Return to your lord (i.e. king...) The Sunnah of our Prophet praised Prophet Yusuf and asserted his virtues, honor, elevated rank and patience, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him.

He asked them all, even though he was directing his speech at the wife of his minister, the `Aziz in particular. He asked the women who cut their hands,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ÎóØúÈõßõäøó</div><br>  (What was your affair...), what was your story with regards to,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ÑóÇæóÏÊõäøó íõæÓõİó Úóä äøóİúÓöåö</div><br>  (when you did seek to seduce Yusuf) on the day of the banquet   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáúäó ÍóÇÔó ááøóåö ãóÇ ÚóáöãúäóÇ Úóáóíúåö ãöä ÓõæÁò</div><br>  (The women said: "Allah forbid!

Hashasa also means, `became clear and plain',   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóäóÇú ÑóæóÏúÊøõåõ Úóä äøóİúÓöåö æóÅöäøóåõ áóãöäó ÇáÕøóÜÏöŞöíäó</div><br>  (it was I who sought to seduce him, and he is surely of the truthful.) when he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åöìó ÑóÇæóÏóÊúäöì Úóä äøóİúÓöì</div><br>  (It was she that sought to seduce me.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó áöíóÚúáóãó Ãóäøöì áóãú ÃóÎõäúåõ ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö</div><br>  (in order that he may know that I betrayed him not in (his) absence. ) She said, `I admit this against myself so that my husband knows that I did not betray him in his absence and that adultery did not occur.

She said, `I do not exonerate myself from blame, because the soul wishes and lusts, and this is what made me seduce him,' for,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáäøóİúÓó áÃóãøóÇÑóÉñ ÈöÇáÓøõæÁö ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ÑóÍöãó ÑóÈøöì</div><br>  (Verily, the (human) self is inclined to evil, except when my Lord bestows His mercy (upon whom He wills).) whom Allah the Exalted wills to grant them immunity,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÑóÈøöì ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This is the most viable and suitable understanding for the continuity of the story and the meanings of Arabic speech. Al-Mawardi mentioned this in his Tafsir, in support of it, it was also preferred by Imam Abu Al-`Abbas Ibn Taymiyyah who wrote about it in detail in a separate work. It was said Yusuf peace be upon him is the one who said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó áöíóÚúáóãó Ãóäøöì áóãú ÃóÎõäúåõ</div><br>  (in order that he (the `Aziz) may know that I betrayed him not) with his wife,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö</div><br>  (in (his) absence).) until the end of Ayah (53) He said, `I sent back the emissary, so that the king would investigate my innocence and the `Aziz be certain that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøöì áóãú ÃóÎõäúåõ</div><br>  (I betrayed him not), with his wife,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÃóäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íóåúÏöì ßóíúÏó ÇáúÎóÜÆöäöíäó</div><br>  (in (his) absence. And, verily, Allah guides not the plot of the betrayers.)'  This is the only explanation presented by Ibn Jarir At-Tabari and Ibn Abi Hatim, but the first view is stronger and more obvious because it is a continuation of what the wife of the `Aziz said in the presence of the king. Yusuf was not present at all during this time, for he was released later on and brought to the king by his order.  </div></body></html>
