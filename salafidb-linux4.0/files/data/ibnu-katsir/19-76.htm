Similarly He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÂ ÃõäÒöáóÊú ÓõæÑóÉñ İóãöäúåõãú ãøóä íóŞõæáõ Ãóíøõßõãú ÒóÇÏóÊúåõ åóÜĞöåö ÅöíãóÜäÇğ</div><br>  (And whenever there comes down a Surah, some of them say: "Which of you has had his faith increased by it'') 9:124 And the following Ayah also shows this. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÈóÜŞöíóÇÊõ ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÇÊõ</div><br>  (And the righteous good deeds that last) Its explanation has already preceded in Surat Al-Kahf, along with a lengthy discussion concerning it and the related Hadiths.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóíúÑñ ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøößó ËóæóÇÈğÇ</div><br>  ((they) are better with your Lord for reward.) meaning the recompense and reward.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÎóíúÑñ ãøóÑóÏøÇğ</div><br>  (and better for resort.) meaning in the final outcome, the result for its doer.  </div></body></html>
