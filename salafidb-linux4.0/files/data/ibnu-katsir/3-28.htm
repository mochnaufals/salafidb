Let not the believers take the disbelievers as friends instead of the believers, and whoever does that, will never be helped by Allah in any way, unless you indeed fear a danger from them.

Allah warned against such behavior when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóİúÚóáú Ğóáößó İóáóíúÓó ãöäó Çááøóåö İöí ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (And whoever does that, will never be helped by Allah in any way) meaning, whoever commits this act that Allah has prohibited, then Allah will discard him. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÚóÏõæøöì æóÚóÏõæøóßõãú ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó ÊõáúŞõæäó Åöáóíúåöãú ÈöÇáúãóæóÏøóÉö</div><br>  (O you who believe!

Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó ãöä Ïõæäö ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÃóÊõÑöíÏõæäó Ãóä ÊóÌúÚóáõæÇú ááøóåö Úóáóíúßõãú ÓõáúØóÇäÇğ ãøõÈöíäÇğ </div><br>  (O you who believe!

Take not the Jews and the Christians as friends, they are but friends of each other. And whoever befriends them, then surely, he is one of them.) 5:51.  Allah said, after mentioning the fact that the faithful believers gave their support to the faithful believers among the Muhajirin, Ansar and Bedouins,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÈóÚúÖõåõãú ÃóæúáöíóÂÁõ ÈóÚúÖò ÅöáÇøó ÊóİúÚóáõæåõ Êóßõäú İöÊúäóÉñ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóİóÓóÇÏñ ßóÈöíÑñ </div><br>  (And those who disbelieve are allies of one another, (and) if you do not behave the same, there will be Fitnah and oppression on the earth, and a great mischief and corruption.) 8:73.  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇó Ãóä ÊóÊøóŞõæÇú ãöäúåõãú ÊõŞóÜÉğ</div><br>  (unless you indeed fear a danger from them) meaning, except those believers who in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers. In this case, such believers are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly. For instance, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Ad-Darda' said, "We smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them.'' Al-Bukhari said that Al-Hasan said, "The Tuqyah is allowed until the Day of Resurrection.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÍóĞøöÑõßõãõ Çááøóåõ äóİúÓóåõ</div><br>  (And Allah warns you against Himself.) meaning, He warns you against His anger and the severe torment He prepared for those who give their support to His enemies, and those who have enmity with His friends,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöáóì Çááøóåö ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ</div><br>  (And to Allah is the final return) meaning, the return is to Him and He will reward or punish each person according to their deeds.  </div></body></html>
