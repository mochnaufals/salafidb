They also ignored the knowledge that they inherited from previous Prophets, about the description of Muhammad , so that they may have a small amount of the delights of this life.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÑöíÏõæäó Ãóä ÊóÖöáøõæÇú ÇáÓøóÈöíáó</div><br>  (and wishing that you should go astray from the right path.) for they would like that you disbelieve in what was sent down to you, O believers, and that you abandon the guidance and beneficial knowledge that you have.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöÃóÚúÏóÇÆößõãú</div><br>  (Allah has full knowledge of your enemies) meaning, Allah has better knowledge of your enemies, and He warns you against them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóİóì ÈöÇááøóåö æóáöíøÇğ æóßóİóì ÈöÇááøóåö äóÕöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (and Allah is sufficient as a Wali (Protector), and Allah is Sufficient as a Helper) He is a Sufficient Protector for those who seek refuge with Him and a Sufficient Supporter for those who seek His help. Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÍóÑøöİõæäó Çáúßóáöãó Úóä ãøóæóÇÖöÚöåö</div><br>  (there are some who displace words from (their) right places) meaning, they intentionally and falsely alter the meanings of the Words of Allah and explain them in a different manner than what Allah meant,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæäó ÓóãöÚúäóÇ æóÚóÕóíúäóÇ</div><br>  (And say: "We hear your word and disobey) saying, "We hear what you say, O Muhammad, but we do not obey you in it,'' as Mujahid and Ibn Zayd explained.  This is the implied meaning of the Ayah, and it demonstrates the Jews' disbelief, stubbornness and disregard for Allah's Book after they understood it, all the while aware of the sin and punishment that this behavior will earn for them. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúãóÚú ÛóíúÑó ãõÓúãóÚò</div><br>  (And "Hear and let you hear nothing.'') means, hear our words, may you never hear anything, as Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas. This is the Jews' way of mocking and jesting, may Allah's curse descend on them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÚöäóÇ áóíøÇğ ÈöÃóáúÓöäóÊöåöãú æóØóÚúäÇğ İöì ÇáÏøöíäö</div><br>  (And Ra`ina, with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion.) meaning, they pretend to say, `Hear us,' when they say, Ra`ina (an insult in Hebrew, but in Arabic it means `Listen to us.').' Yet, their true aim is to curse the Prophet . We mentioned this subject when we explained Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóŞõæáõæÇú ÑóÚöäóÇ æóŞõæáõæÇú ÇäÙõÑúäóÇ</div><br>  (O you who believe! Say not Ra`ina but say Unzurna (make us understand)). Therefore, Allah said about them, while they pretend to say other than what they truly mean,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíøÇğ ÈöÃóáúÓöäóÊöåöãú æóØóÚúäÇğ İöì ÇáÏøöíäö</div><br>  (With a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion) because of their cursing the Prophet . Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú Ãóäøóåõãú ŞóÇáõæÇú ÓóãöÚúäóÇ æóÃóØóÚúäóÇ æóÇÓúãóÚú æóÇäúÙõÑúäóÇ áóßóÇäó ÎóíúÑÇğ áøóåõãú æóÃóŞúæóãó æóáóßöä áøóÚóäóåõãõ Çááøóåõ ÈößõİúÑöåöãú İóáÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÅöáÇøó ŞóáöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And if only they had said: "We hear and obey'', and "Do make us understand,'' it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except a few.) meaning, their hearts are cast away from the path of righteousness and therefore, no beneficial part of faith enters it. Earlier, when we explained,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóáöíáÇğ ãøóÇ íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (so little is that which they believe) which means they do not have beneficial faith.  </div></body></html>
