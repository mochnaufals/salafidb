But forgive and overlook, till Allah brings His command. Verily, Allah is able to do all things.) (110. And perform the Salah and give the Zakah, and whatever of good you send forth for yourselves before you, you shall find it with Allah.

Allah also commanded His believing servants to forgive them and to be patient with them, until Allah delivers His aid and victory to them. Allah commanded the believers to perform the prayer perfectly, to pay the Zakah and He encouraged them to preserve the practice of these righteous deeds.  Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Ka`b bin Malik said that Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf, who was a Jew and a poet, used to criticize the Prophet in his poems, so Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÏøó ßóËöíÑñ ãøöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö áóæú íóÑõÏøõæäóßõã</div><br>  (Many of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that they could turn you away..) regarding his matter.  Also, Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, "An unlettered Messenger came to the People of the Scriptures confirming what they have in their own Books about the Messengers and the Ayat of Allah. He also believes in all of this, just as they believe in it. Yet, they rejected the Prophet out of disbelief, envy and transgression. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõİøóÇÑğÇ ÍóÓóÏğÇ ãøöäú ÚöäúÏö ÃóäúİõÓöåöãú ãøöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÊóÈóíøóäó áóåõãõ ÇáúÍóŞøõ</div><br>  (out of envy from their own selves, even after the truth (that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger) has become manifest unto them).  Allah said that after He illuminated the truth for them, such that they were not ignorant of any of it, yet their envy made them deny the Prophet . Thus Allah criticized, chastised and denounced them.'' Allah legislated the characteristics that His Prophet and the believers should adhere to: belief, faith and accepting what Allah revealed to them and to those before them out of His generosity and tremendous kindness.  Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöäú ÚöäúÏö ÃóäúİõÓöåöãú</div><br>  (from their own selves) means, "of their making.'' Also, Abu Al-`Aliyah said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÊóÈóíøóäó áóåõãõ ÇáúÍóŞøõ</div><br>  (even after the truth (that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger) has become manifest unto them) means, "After it became clear that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah whom they find written of in the Torah and the Injil. They denied him in disbelief and transgression because he was not one of them.'' Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said similarly. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúİõæÇú æóÇÕúİóÍõæÇú ÍóÊøóì íóÃúÊöìó Çááøóåõ ÈöÃóãúÑöåö</div><br>  (But forgive and overlook, till Allah brings His command.) this is similar to His saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÊóÓúãóÚõäøó ãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ãöä ŞóÈúáößõãú æóãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÔúÑóßõæÇú ÃóĞğì ßóËöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (And you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allah) (3: 186).  `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúİõæÇú æóÇÕúİóÍõæÇú ÍóÊøóì íóÃúÊöìó Çááøóåõ ÈöÃóãúÑöåö</div><br>  (But forgive and overlook, till Allah brings His command.) was abrogated by the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇŞúÊõáõæÇú ÇáúãõÔúÑößöíäó ÍóíúËõ æóÌóÏÊøõãõæåõãú</div><br>  (Then kill the Mushrikin wherever you find them) (9:5), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÜÊöáõæÇú ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóáÇó ÈöÇáúíóæúãö ÇáÇøñÎöÑö</div><br>  (Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day) (9:29) until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú ÕóÜÛöÑõæäó</div><br>  (And feel themselves subdued) (9:29).  Allah's pardon for the disbelievers was repealed.'' Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Qatadah and As-Suddi said similarly: It was abrogated by the Ayah of the sword." (Mentioned above). The Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì íóÃúÊöìó Çááøóåõ ÈöÃóãúÑöåö</div><br>  (till Allah brings His command.) gives further support for this view.  Ibn Abi Hatim recorded Usamah bin Zayd saying that the Messenger of Allah and his Companions used to forgive the disbelievers and the People of the Book, just as Allah commanded in His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúİõæÇú æóÇÕúİóÍõæÇú ÍóÊøóì íóÃúÊöìó Çááøóåõ ÈöÃóãúÑöåö Åöäøó Çááøóåó Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ</div><br>  (But forgive and overlook, till Allah brings His command. Verily, Allah is able to do all things).  The Messenger of Allah used to forgive them and was patient with them as Allah ordered him, until Allah allowed fighting them. Then Allah destroyed those who He decreed to be killed among the strong men of Quraysh, by the Prophet's forces. The chain of narration for this text is Sahih, but I did not see its wordings in the six collections of Hadith, although the basis of it is in the Two Sahihs, narrated from Usamah bin Zayd. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Encouragement to perform Good Deeds</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóŞöíãõæÇú ÇáÕøóáóæÉó æóÁóÇÊõæÇú ÇáÒøóßóæÉó æóãóÇ ÊõŞóÏøöãõæÇú áÃóäúİõÓößõã ãøöäú ÎóíúÑò ÊóÌöÏõæåõ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And perform the Salah and give the Zakah, and whatever of good you send forth for yourselves before you, you shall find it with Allah).  Allah encouraged the believers to busy themselves in performing deeds that would bring them benefit and reward on the Day of Resurrection, such as prayer and paying Zakah. This way, they will gain Allah's aid in this life and on a Day when the witnesses testify,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó áÇó íóäİóÚõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó ãóÚúĞöÑóÊõåõãú æóáóåõãõ ÇáúáøóÚúäóÉõ æóáóåõãú ÓõæÁõ ÇáÏøóÇÑö </div><br>  (The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to the Zalimin (wrongdoers). Theirs will be the curse, and theirs will be the evil abode (i.e. painful torment in Hell-fire)) (40:52).  This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÈöãóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó ÈóÕöíÑñ</div><br>  (Certainly, Allah sees what you do), meaning, that He is never unaware of the deeds of any person, nor will these deeds be lost by Him. Whether deeds are righteous or evil, Allah will award each according to what he or she deserves based on their deeds.  </div></body></html>
