This means that all of those who disbelieved in Allah were removed from the people of the earth.

Mujahid said, "Judi is a mountain in Al-Jazirah (Northwest Mesopotamia) where the mountains sought to tower above each other on the day of the drowning. On that day of destruction, all the mountains sought to be higher (to avoid being overcome by the water). However, this mountain (Judi) humbled itself for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and therefore it was not drowned. This is why Nuh's ship anchored upon it.'' Qatadah said, "The ship rested upon it (Mount Judi) for a month before they (the people) came down from it. '' Qatadah also said, "Allah made Nuh's ship remain on Mount Judi in the land of Al-Jazirah, as a lesson and a sign.'' Even the early generations of this Ummah saw it. How many ships are there that have come after it and have been destroyed and became dust   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞöíáó ÈõÚúÏğÇ áøöáúŞóæúãö ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (and it was said: "Away with the people who are wrongdoing!'') means destruction and loss for them. The term "away with'' here implies being far away from the mercy of Allah. For verily, they were destroyed to the last of them, and none of them survived.  </div></body></html>
