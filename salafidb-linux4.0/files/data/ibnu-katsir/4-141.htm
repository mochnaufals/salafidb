Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇááøóåõ íóÍúßõãõ Èóíúäóßõãú íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö</div><br>  (Allah will judge between you (all) on the Day of Resurrection) meaning, by what He knows about you, O hypocrites. Therefore, do not be deceived by being shaded under the protection of Islamic Law in this life, which is such only out of Allah's wisdom. Surely, on the Day of Resurrection, your pretending shall not benefit you, because on that Day, the secrets of the souls will be disclosed and the contents of the hearts will be collected. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóä íóÌúÚóáó Çááøóåõ áöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers). `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Yasi` Al-Kindi said, "A man came to `Ali bin Abi Talib and said, `What about this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóä íóÌúÚóáó Çááøóåõ áöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers.) `Ali said, `Come closer, come closer. Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection, and He will not grant victory for the disbelievers over the believers.' '' Ibn Jurayj recorded that `Ata' Al-Khurasani said that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóä íóÌúÚóáó Çááøóåõ áöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers.) "Will occur on the Day of Resurrection.'' As-Suddi recorded that Abu Malik Al-Ashja`i said that it occurs on the Day of Resurrection. As-Suddi said that "way'' means, proof. It is possible that the meaning of, `and never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers', is in this life by being unable to exterminate the believers completely, although they sometimes gain victory over some Muslims. However, the Final Triumph will be for the believers in this life and the Hereafter. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ áóäóäÕõÑõ ÑõÓõáóäóÇ æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ</div><br>  (Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in the worldly life) This provides a rebuttal to the wishes of the hypocrites for the destruction of the believers, and their loyalty to the disbelievers, fearing for themselves if they are victorious. In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóÑóì ÇáøóĞöíäó İöì ŞõáõæÈöåöã ãøóÑóÖñ íõÓóÜÑöÚõæäó İöíåöãú</div><br>  (And you see those in whose hearts there is a disease (of hypocrisy), they hurry to their friendship), until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÜÏöãöíäó</div><br>  (Regretful)  </div></body></html>
