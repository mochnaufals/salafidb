And He blessed him with a mighty voice. Such that when he glorified Allah, the firm, solid, high mountains joined him in glorifying Allah, and the free-roaming birds, who go out in the morning and come back in the evening, stopped for him, and he was able to speak all languages. In the Sahih it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah heard the voice of Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, may Allah be pleased with him, reciting at night, and he stopped and listened to his recitation, then he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóŞóÏú ÃõæÊöíó åĞóÇ ãöÒúãóÇÑğÇ ãöäú ãóÒóÇãöíÑö Âáö ÏóÇæõÏ»</div><br>  (This man has been given one of the sweet melodious voices of the Prophet Dawud.) Abu `Uthman An-Nahdi said, "I never heard any cymbal, stringed instrument or chord that was more beautiful than the voice of Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, may Allah be pleased with him.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóæøöÈöì</div><br>  (Glorify) means, glorify Allah. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others. The root of this word Ta'wib means to repeat or respond, so the mountains and birds were commanded to repeat after him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóáóäøóÇ áóåõ ÇáúÍóÏöíÏó</div><br>  And We made the iron soft for him. Al-Háasan Al-Basári, Qata0dah, Al-A mash and others said, He did not need to heat it in the fire or beat it with a hammerº he could simply twist it in his hands, like a thread. Alla0h said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäö ÇÚúãóáú ÓóÜÈöÛóÜÊò</div><br>  Saying: Make you perfect coats of mail... , which means chain mail. Qata0dah said, He was the first person ever to make chain mailº before that, they used to wear plated armor.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÏøöÑú İöì ÇáÓøóÑúÏö</div><br>  (and balance well the rings of chain armor Sard,) This is how Allah taught His Prophet Dawud, peace be upon him, to make coats of mail. Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÏøöÑú İöì ÇáÓøóÑúÏö</div><br>  (and balance well the rings of chain armor Sard,) "Do not make the rivets too loose that the rings (of chain mail) will shake, or make them too tight that they will not be able to move at all, but make it just right.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that `Ibn `Abbas said, "Sard refers to a ring of iron.'' Some of them said, "Chain mail is called Masrud if it is held together with rivets.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÚúãóáõæÇú ÕóÜáöÍÇğ</div><br>  and work you (men) righteousness. means, with regard to what Alla0h has given you of blessings.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì ÈöãóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó ÈóÕöíÑñ</div><br>  Truly, I am All-Seer of what you do. means, watching you and seeing all that you do and sayº nothing of that is hidden at all.  </div></body></html>
