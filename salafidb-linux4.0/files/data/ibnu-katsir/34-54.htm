Al-Hasan Al-Basri said: "When they come forth from their graves.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Èöåö</div><br>  (And they will say: "We do believe (now);'') means, on the Day of Resurrection, they will say, `we believe in Allah and His angels, Books and Messengers.'

Mujahid said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóì áóåõãõ ÇáÊøóäóÇæõÔõ</div><br>  but how could they At-Tana0wush¿ means, How could they attain that¿ Az-Zuhri said, They will wish to attain faith when they have reached the Hereafter and are cut off from this world. Al-Háasan Al-Basári said, They will seek something when they have no way of attaining it, they will seek faith from a distant place.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÏú ßóÜİóÑõæÇú Èöåö ãöä ŞóÜÈúáõ</div><br>  Indeed they did disbelieve before, means, how can they attain faith in the Hereafter when in this world they disbelieved in the truth and denied the Messengers¿   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞúĞöİõæäó ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö ãöä ãøóßóÇäò ÈóÚöíÏò</div><br>  (and they (used to) conjecture about the Unseen from a far place. ) Malik narrated from Zayd bin Aslam that he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞúĞöİõæäó ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö</div><br>  (and they (used to) conjecture about the Unseen,) means, "By guessing.'' as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÌúãÇğ ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö</div><br>  guessing at the Unseen )18:22(. Sometimes they said he was a poet, sometimes they said he was a soothsayer, or a sorcerer, or a mad man, or other baseless comments. They denied the idea of resurrection and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä äøóÙõäøõ ÅöáÇøó ÙóäøÇğ æóãóÇ äóÍúäõ ÈöãõÓúÊóíúŞöäöíäó</div><br>  (we do not think it but as a conjecture, and we have no firm convincing belief.) (45:32). Qatadah and Mujahid said, "Their belief that there would be no resurrection, no Paradise and no Hell was based on mere conjecture.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍöíáó Èóíúäóåõãú æóÈóíúäó ãóÇ íóÔúÊóåõæäó</div><br>  (And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire,) Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ad-Dahhak and others, `This means faith.'' As-Suddi said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍöíáó Èóíúäóåõãú æóÈóíúäó ãóÇ íóÔúÊóåõæäó</div><br>  (And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire, ) means "Repentance.'' This was also the view of Ibn Jarir, may Allah have mercy on him. Mujahid said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍöíáó Èóíúäóåõãú æóÈóíúäó ãóÇ íóÔúÊóåõæäó</div><br>  (And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire,) means, "This world and its wealth, luxuries and people.'' Something similar was narrated from Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, may Allah be pleased with him. It is also the opinion of Al-Bukhari and the Group. The correct view is that there is no contradiction between the two views, for a barrier will be set between them and what they desire in this world, and what they seek in the Hereafter will be denied from them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóãóÇ İõÚöáó ÈöÃóÔúíóÜÚöåöã ãøöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (as was done in the past with the people of their kind.) means, as happened to the nations of the past who disbelieved in the Messengers; when the punishment of Allah came upon them, they wished that they had believed, but this was not accepted from them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÃóæúÇú ÈóÃúÓóäóÇ ŞóÇáõæÇú ÁóÇãóäøóÇ ÈöÇááøóåö æóÍúÏóåõ æóßóÜİóÑúäóÇ ÈöãóÇ ßõäøóÇ Èöåö ãõÔúÑößöíäó - İóáóãú íóßõ íóäİóÚõåõãú ÅöíãóÜäõåõãú áóãøóÇ ÑóÃóæúÇú ÈóÃúÓóäóÇ ÓõäøóÉó Çááøóåö ÇáøóÊöì ŞóÏú ÎóáóÊú İöì ÚöÈóÇÏöåö æóÎóÓöÑó åõäóÇáößó ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó </div><br>  (So, when they saw Our punishment, they said: "We believe in Allah Alone and reject (all) that we used to associate with Him as (His) partners. "Then their faith could not avail them when they saw Our punishment. (Like) this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants. And there the disbelievers lost utterly.) (40:84-85).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõãú ßóÇäõæÇú İöì Ôóßøò ãøõÑöíÈö</div><br>  Verily, they have been in grave doubt. means, in this world they had doubts, so their faith will not be accepted from them when they behold the punishment with their own eyes. Qata0dah said, Beware of doubt. For whoever dies doubting, will be raised doubtingº and whoever dies believing, with certainty will be raised believing with certainty. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Saba'. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Guide to the right way.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
