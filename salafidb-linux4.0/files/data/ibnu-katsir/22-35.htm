It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah brought two fat, horned rams; he said Bismillah and Allahu Akbar, then he put his foot on their necks.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöáóÜåõßõãú ÅöáóÜåñ æóÍöÏñ İóáóåõ ÃóÓúáöãõæÇú</div><br>  (And your God is One God, so you must submit to Him Alone.) Your God is One, even though the Laws of the Prophets may vary and may abrogate one another. All of the Prophets called mankind to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ãöä ÑøóÓõæáò ÅöáÇøó äõæÍöì Åöáóíúåö Ãóäøóåõ áÇ ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó ÃóäóÇú İóÇÚúÈõÏõæäö </div><br>  (And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying): None has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me.) 21:25. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóåõ ÃóÓúáöãõæÇú</div><br>  (so you must submit to Him Alone.) meaning, submit to His commands and obey Him in all sincerity.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóÔøöÑö ÇáúãõÎúÈöÊöíäó</div><br>  (And give glad tidings to the Mukhbitin.) Mujahid said about Mukhbitin, "Those who find contentment in their faith.'' Ath-Thawri said, "Those who find contentment in their faith and who accept the decree of Allah and submit to Him.'' It is better to interpret it by what comes next, which is:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÇ ĞõßöÑó Çááøóåõ æóÌöáóÊú ŞõáõæÈõåõãú</div><br>  (Whose hearts are filled with fear when Allah is mentioned,) meaning, their hearts fear Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÕøóÜÈöÑöíäó Úóáóì ãóÂ ÃóÕóÇÈóåõãú</div><br>  (and the patient who bear whatever may befall them) meaning, of afflictions.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõŞöíãöì ÇáÕøóáóæÉö</div><br>  (and who perform the Salah,) they fulfill the duties which Allah has enjoined upon them, the duty of performing the obligatory prayers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöãøóÇ ÑóÒóŞúäóÜåõãú íõäİöŞõæäó</div><br>  (and who spend out of what We have provided for them.) the good provision which Allah has given them. They spend on their families and servants, and on the poor and needy; they treat people kindly while remaining within the limits set by Allah. This is in contrast to the hypocrites, who are the opposite of all this, as we have discussed in the Tafsir of Surah Bara'ah; to Allah be praise and blessings.  </div></body></html>
