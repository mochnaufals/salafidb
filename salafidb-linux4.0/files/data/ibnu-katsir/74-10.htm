The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÈóíúäóÇ ÃóäóÇ ÃóãúÔöí ÅöĞú ÓóãöÚúÊõ ÕóæúÊğÇ ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö İóÑóİóÚúÊõ ÈóÕóÑöí ŞöÈóáó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö¡ İóÅöĞóÇ Çáúãóáóßõ ÇáøóĞöí ÌóÇÁóäöí ÈöÍöÑóÇÁó¡ ŞóÇÚöÏñ Úóáóì ßõÑúÓöíó Èóíúäó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ İóÌõÆöËúÊõ ãöäúåõ ÍóÊúì åóæóíúÊõ Åöáóì ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ İóÌöÆúÊõ Åöáóì Ãóåúáöí İóŞõáúÊõ: Òóãøöáõæäöí Òóãøöáõæäöí İóÒóãøóáõæäöí.

So I lifted my gaze towards the sky and saw the same angel who had come to me at the cave of Hira'. He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him (in fear) until I fell down to the ground. Then, I went to my family and I said, `Wrap me up, wrap me up. So, they wrapped me up! So Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn!) until (And keep away) Here, Abu Salamah added, `Ar-Rujz means idols.' (After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) This is the wording of Al-Bukhari. The way this Hadith is narrated necessitates that revelation had descended before this. This is due to the Prophet's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöĞóÇ Çáúãóáóßõ ÇáøóĞöí ÌóÇÁóäöí ÈöÍöÑóÇÁ»</div><br>  (The same angel who had come to me at the cave of Hira'.)'' That angel was Jibril, who had came to him with Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÑóÃú ÈöÇÓúãö ÑóÈøößó ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó - ÎóáóŞó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ãöäú ÚóáóŞò - ÇŞúÑóÃú æóÑóÈøõßó ÇáÇøñßúÑóãõ - ÇáøóĞöì Úóáøóãó ÈöÇáúŞóáóãö - Úóáøóãó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ãóÇ áóãú íóÚúáóãú </div><br>  (Read!

(96:1-5) After this first occurrence (in the cave) there was a period of time that passed, then the angel descended again.  Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman that Jabir bin `Abdullah informed him that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ëõãøó İóÊóÑó ÇáúæóÍúíõ Úóäøöí İóÊúÑóÉğ¡ İóÈóíúäóÇ ÃóäóÇ ÃóãúÔöí ÓóãöÚúÊõ ÕóæúÊğÇ ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö¡ İóÑóİóÚúÊõ ÈóÕóÑöí ŞöÈóáó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö¡ İóÅöĞóÇ Çáúãóáóßõ ÇáøóĞöí ÌóÇÁóäöí¡ ŞóÇÚöÏñ Úóáì ßõÑúÓöíó Èóíúäó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ İóÌõÆöËúÊõ ãöäúåõ İóÑóŞğÇ ÍóÊúì åóæóíúÊõ Åöáóì ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ İóÌöÆúÊõ Ãóåúáöí İóŞõáúÊõ áóåõãú: Òóãøöáõæäöí Òóãøöáõæäöí İóÒóãøóáõæäöí¡ İóÃóäúÒóáó Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáì:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúãõÏøóËøöÑõ - Şõãú İóÃóäĞöÑú - æóÑóÈøóßó İóßóÈøöÑú - æóËöíóÇÈóßó İóØóåøöÑú - æóÇáÑøõÌúÒó İóÇåúÌõÑú </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó Íóãöíó ÇáúæóÍúíõ æóÊóÊóÇÈóÚ»</div><br>  (Then the revelation ceased coming to me for a period of time.Then, while I was walking, I heard a voice from the sky. So I lifted my gaze towards the sky to see the same angel who had come to me, sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him a short distance before I fell down to the ground. Then I came to my family and said to them, `Wrap me up, wrap me up! So, they wrapped me up! Then Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn! And magnify your Lord. And purify your garments. And keep away from Ar-Rujz!)( After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded this Hadith by way of Az-Zuhri.  At-Tabarani recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "Verily, Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah prepared some food for the Quraysh. So when they had eaten from it he said, `What do you have to say about this man' Some of them said, `He is a magician.' Others said, `He is not a magician.' Then some of them said, `He is a soothsayer.' But others said, `He is not a soothsayer.' Some of them said, `He is a poet.' But others said, `He is not a poet.' Some of them said, `This is magic from that of old.' Thus, they eventually all agreed that it was magic from ancient times. Then, when this news reached the Prophet , he became grieved, covered his head and wrapped himself up. This is when Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúãõÏøóËøöÑõ - Şõãú İóÃóäĞöÑú - æóÑóÈøóßó İóßóÈøöÑú - æóËöíóÇÈóßó İóØóåøöÑú - æóÇáÑøõÌúÒó İóÇåúÌõÑú - æóáÇó Êóãúäõä ÊóÓúÊóßúËöÑõ - æóáöÑóÈøößó İóÇÕúÈöÑú </div><br>  (O you enveloped in garments!

And give not a thing in order to have more (or consider not your deeds of obedience to Allah as a favour to Him). And be patient for the sake of your Lord (i.e., perform your duty to Allah)!) Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõãú İóÃóäĞöÑú </div><br>  (Arise and warn!) means, prepare to go forth with zeal and warn the people. With this the Prophet attained messengership just as he attained prophethood with the first revelation.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÈøóßó İóßóÈøöÑú </div><br>  (And magnify your Lord!) to declare the greatness of Him. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóËöíóÇÈóßó İóØóåøöÑú </div><br>  (And purify your garments!) "This means, do not let your garments that you wear be from earnings that are unlawful.'' It has also been said, "Do not wear your clothes in disobedience.'' Muhammad bin Sirin said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóËöíóÇÈóßó İóØóåøöÑú </div><br>  (And purify your garments!) "This means clean them with water.'' Ibn Zayd said, "The idolators would not clean themselves, so Allah commanded him to clean himself and his garments.'' This view was preferred by Ibn Jarir. Sa`id bin Jubayr said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóËöíóÇÈóßó İóØóåøöÑú </div><br>  (And purify your garments!) "This means purify your heart and your intentions.'' Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Hasan Al-Basri both said, "And beautify your character.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÑøõÌúÒó İóÇåúÌõÑú </div><br>  (And keep away from Ar-Rujz!) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, "Ar-Rujz are idols, so keep away from them.'' Similar to this was said by Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Zayd, "Verily, it is the idols.'' This is like Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÈöìøö ÇÊøóŞö Çááøóåó æóáÇó ÊõØöÚö ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó æóÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó</div><br>  (O Prophet! have Taqwa of Allah, and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites.)

Ibn `Abbas said, "Do not give any gift seeking to get (back in return) more than it.''

Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöÑóÈøößó İóÇÕúÈöÑú </div><br>  (And be patient for the sake of your Lord!) meaning, make your patience with their harms be for the Face of your Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. This was stated by Mujahid. Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, "Be patient in your giving for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Reminding of the Day of Judgement</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ äõŞöÑó İöì ÇáäøóÇŞõæÑö - İóĞóáößó íóæúãóÆöĞò íóæúãñ ÚóÓöíÑñ - Úóáóì ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÛóíúÑõ íóÓöíÑò </div><br>  (Then, when the Naqur is sounded.
