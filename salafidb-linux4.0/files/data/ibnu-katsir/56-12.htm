Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíóæúãóÆöĞò æóŞóÚóÊö ÇáúæóÇŞöÚóÉõ </div><br>  (Then on that Day shall the Waqi`ah occur.)( 69:15) Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó áöæóŞúÚóÊöåóÇ ßóÇĞöÈóÉñ </div><br>  (There is not, for its occurrence, Kadhibah.) means, when He commands the Day of Resurrection to begin, none can stop it from happening or prevent it from beginning,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÓúÊóÌöíÈõæÇú áöÑóÈøößõãú ãøöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä íóÃúÊöìó íóæúãñ áÇøó ãóÑóÏøó áóåõ ãöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Answer the call of your Lord before there comes from Allah a Day which can not be averted.) (42:47),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÃóáó ÓóÂÆöáñ ÈöÚóĞóÇÈò æóÇŞöÚò - áøöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó áóíúÓó áóåõ ÏóÇİöÚñ </div><br>  (A questioner asked concerning a torment about to occur -- upon the disbelievers, which none can avert.)(70:1-2),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóæúãó íóŞõæáõ ßõä İóíóßõæäõ Şóæúáõåõ ÇáúÍóŞøõ æóáóåõ Çáúãõáúßõ íóæúãó íõäİóÎõ İöì ÇáÕøõæóÑö ÚóÜáöãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÇáÔøóåóÜÏóÉö æóåõæó ÇáúÍóßöíãõ ÇáúÎóÈöíÑõ</div><br>  (And on the Day He will say: "Be!'' -- and it is! His Word is the Truth. His will be the dominion on the Day when the Trumpet will be blown. All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the All-Wise, Well Aware.)(6:73) As for the meaning of   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇĞöÈóÉñ</div><br>  (Kadhibah) Muhammad bin Ka`b said: "It will certainly occur,'' while Qatadah said, "It shall not be discontinued, taken back or aborted. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÇİöÖóÉñ ÑøóÇİöÚóÉñ </div><br>  (Bringing low, exalting.) indicates that Al-Waqi`ah lowers some people to the lowest parts of the Fire, even if they had been mighty in this life. It also elevates others to the highest grades in the residence of eternal delight, even if they were weak in this life. This was said by Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÇİöÖóÉñ ÑøóÇİöÚóÉñ </div><br>  (Bringing low, exalting), "It made the near and the far hear it,'' while `Ikrimah said, "It lowered, and thus those who were close heard it, and elevated, and thus those in the distance heard it.'' Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said similarly. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÑõÌøóÊö ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ÑóÌøÇğ </div><br>  (When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.) meaning, it is shaken and moved violently over all of its surface and through its depths. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others said about Allah's saying:,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÑõÌøóÊö ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ÑóÌøÇğ </div><br>  (When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.) it means "Violently shaken.'' Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, "The earth will be shaken with all that is in it, just as a sifter is shaken with its contents.'' This is like Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÒõáúÒöáóÊö ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ÒöáúÒóÇáóåóÇ </div><br>  (When the earth is shaken with its earthquake.)(99:1) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÇÊøóŞõæÇú ÑóÈøóßõãú Åöäøó ÒóáúÒóáóÉó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÔóìúÁñ ÚóÙöíãñ </div><br>  (O mankind! Have Taqwa of your Lord! Verily, the earthquake of the Hour is a terrible thing.)(22:1). Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈõÓøóÊö ÇáúÌöÈóÇáõ ÈóÓøÇğ </div><br>  (And the mountains will be powdered to dust,) meaning, relentlessly pulverized. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Qatadah and others. Ibn Zayd said: "The mountains will become just like Allah described them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóËöíÈÇğ ãøóåöíáÇğ</div><br>  (A heap of sand poured out.)(73:14).'' Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóÇäóÊú åóÈóÂÁğ ãøõäÈóËøÇğ </div><br>  (So that they will become floating dust particles.) Abu Ishaq narrated from Al-Harith, from `Ali: "It will become like the rising dust storm that soon fades away leaving no trace of itself behind.'' Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas about Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóÇäóÊú åóÈóÂÁğ ãøõäÈóËøÇğ </div><br>  (So that they will become floating dust particles.) "It describes the rising embers from the fire when it is kindled, but when the embers land, they are extinguished quickly.'' `Ikrimah said, "The floating dust particles that the wind scatters all around,'' while Qatadah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÈóÂÁğ ãøõäÈóËøÇğ</div><br>  (floating particles), "Like the dry parts of trees that the wind scatters all about.'' This Ayah is similar to several other Ayat that indicate that the mountains will be moved from their places, demolished and blown off their bases, becoming like carded wool on the Day of Resurrection. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Three Categories of People on the Day of Resurrection</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõäÊõãú ÃóÒúæóÇÌÇğ ËóáóÜËóÉğ </div><br>  (And you (all) will be in three groups.) This means that people will be divided into three categories on the Day of Resurrection. Some will on the right of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's right side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their right hand and will be taken to the right side. As-Suddi explained that they will comprise the majority of the residents of Paradise. Another category is those who will be placed to the left of Allah's Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam's left side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their left hands and will be taken to the left side. They are the residents of the Fire, may Allah save us from their actions. A third category is comprised of those who are the foremost and nearest before Allah. They are in a better grade and status and nearer to Allah than those on the right side. They are the chiefs of those on the right side, because they include the Messengers, Prophets, true believers and martyrs. They are fewer than those on the right side; so Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúãóíúãóäóÉö ãóÂ ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúãóíúãóäóÉö - æóÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúãóÔúÜóãóÉö ãóÂ ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúãóÔúÜóãóÉö - æóÇáÓøóÜÈöŞõæäó ÇáÓøóÜÈöŞõæäó </div><br>  (So those on the right -- how will be those on the right! And those on the left -- how will be those on the left! And those foremost will be foremost.) Allah divides people into these three groups upon their death, as indicated by the end of this Surah. Allah mentioned them in His statement as well,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÃóæúÑóËúäóÇ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÕúØóİóíúäóÇ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöäóÇ İóãöäúåõãú ÙóÜáöãñ áøöäóİúÓöåö æóãöäúåõãú ãøõŞúÊóÕöÏñ æóãöäúåõãú ÓóÇÈöŞñ ÈöÇáúÎóíúÑóÊö ÈöÅöĞõäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who are, by Allah's leave, foremost in good deeds.)(35:32) Muhammad bin Ka`b, Abu Hazrah Ya`qub bin Mujahid said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóÜÈöŞõæäó ÇáÓøóÜÈöŞõæäó </div><br>  (And those foremost will be foremost.) is about the Prophets, peace be upon them, while As-Suddi said that they are the residents of the utmost highs (Ahl Al-`Illiyyin, in Paradise). The meaning of foremost is that they were foremost in performing the acts of righteousness just as Allah commanded them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÇÑöÚõæÇú Åöáóì ãóÛúİöÑóÉò ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú æóÌóäøóÉò ÚóÑúÖõåóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊõ æóÇáÇøñÑúÖõ</div><br>  (And march forth in the way to forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.)(3:133) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÇÈöŞõæÇú Åöáóì ãóÛúİöÑóÉò ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú æóÌóäøóÉò ÚóÑúÖõåóÇ ßóÚóÑúÖö ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.)(57:21) Therefore, those who rush to obey Allah in this life and are foremost in performing acts of righteousness, will be among the foremost believers honored in the Hereafter. Verily, the reward is according to the kind of deed, and as one does, so he is judged. So Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÇáúãõŞóÑøóÈõæäó İöì ÌóäøóÜÊö ÇáäøóÚöíãö </div><br>  (These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight.)  </div></body></html>
