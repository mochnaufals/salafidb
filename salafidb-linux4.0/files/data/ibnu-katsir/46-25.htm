Allah sent him to the first people of `Ad who inhabited Al-Ahqaf. Ahqaf is plural of Haqf. According to Ibn Zayd, it means a sand dune; and according to `Ikrimah, it means a mountain or a cave. Qatadah said: "We were informed that `Ad was a tribe in Yemen. They dwelt among sand (hills), and overlooked the sea in a land called Ash-Shihr.'' Under the chapter, "He Who supplicates should first mention Himself,'' Ibn Majah recorded that Ibn `Abbas narrated that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÑúÍóãõäóÇ Çááåõ æóÃóÎóÇ ÚóÇÏ»</div><br>  (May Allah have mercy on us and the Brother of `Ad.)

This is similar to Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÌóÚóáúäóÜåóÇ äóßóÜáÇğ áøöãóÇ Èóíúäó íóÏóíúåóÇ æóãóÇ ÎóáúİóåóÇ</div><br>  (And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded them. ) (2:66) And it is also similar to Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäú ÃóÚúÑóÖõæÇú İóŞõáú ÃóäĞóÑúÊõßõãú ÕóÜÚöŞóÉğ ãøöËúáó ÕóÜÚöŞóÉö ÚóÇÏò æóËóãõæÏó ÅöĞú ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãõ ÇáÑøõÓõáõ ãöä Èóíúäö ÃóíúÏöíåöãú æóãöäú Îóáúİöåöãú ÃóáÇøó ÊóÚúÈõÏõæÇú ÅöáÇøó Çááøóåó</div><br>  (But if they turn away, then say: "I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt that struck `Ad and Thamud. (That occurred) when the Messengers had come to them from before them and after them (saying): "Worship none but Allah.'') (41:13-14) Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì ÃóÎóÇİõ Úóáóíúßõãú ÚóĞóÇÈó íóæúãò ÚóÙöíãò </div><br>  (truly, I fear for you the torment of a mighty Day.) meaning, Hud said this to them (his people), and they responded to him saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÌöÆúÊóäóÇ áöÊóÃúİößóäóÇ Úóäú ÁóÇáöåóÊöäóÇ</div><br>  (Have you come to delude us from our gods) meaning, to prevent us.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóäú ÁóÇáöåóÊöäóÇ</div><br>  (from our gods)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃúÊöäóÇ ÈöãóÇ ÊóÚöÏõäóÂ Åöä ßõäÊó ãöäó ÇáÕøóÜÏöŞöíäó</div><br>  (Then bring us that with which you threaten us, if you are one of the truthful!) They sought to hasten Allah's torment and punishment, believing that it will not happen. This is similar to Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõ ÈöåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (Those who do not believe in it (the Last Hour) seek to hasten it) (42:18). Hud's response was,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáúÚöáúãõ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (He said: "The knowledge (of that) is only with Allah.'') which means, `Allah knows best about you. If you deserve the punishment to be hastened, He will do that to you. As for me, my duty is to deliver my message to you.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöäøöì ÃóÑóÇßõãú ŞóæúãğÇ ÊóÌúåóáõæäó</div><br>  (But I see that you are a people given to ignorance!) which means, `you have no comprehension or understanding.' Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÃóæúåõ ÚóÇÑöÖÇğ ãøõÓúÊóŞúÈöáó ÃóæúÏöíóÊöåöãú</div><br>  (Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud approaching their valleys,) meaning, when they saw the punishment coming towards them, they thought it to be clouds full of rain. That made them happy and joyful, because they had a drought and needed rain. Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú åõæó ãóÇ ÇÓúÊóÚúÌóáúÊõã Èöåö ÑöíÍñ İöíåóÇ ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ</div><br>  (Nay, but it is that which you were asking to be hastened -- a wind wherein is a painful torment!) meaning, this is the torment that you called for saying, "Bring to us what you promise us if you should be of the truthful.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõÏóãøöÑõ ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (Destroying every thing) meaning, destroying every part of their land that could normally be destroyed.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÃóãúÑö ÑóÈøöåóÇ</div><br>  (by the command of its Lord!) meaning, it had Allah's permission to do that. This is similar to Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ÊóĞóÑõ ãöä ÔóìúÁò ÃóÊóÊú Úóáóíúåö ÅöáÇøó ÌóÚóáóÊúåõ ßóÇáÑøóãöíãö </div><br>  d(It spared nothing that it reached, but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins.) (51:42) meaning, like something dilapidated (or decrepit). Because of this, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃúÕúÈóÍõæÇú áÇó íõÑóì ÅöáÇøó ãóÓóÜßöäõåõãú</div><br>  (So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings!) means, all of them were destroyed, and none of them were spared. Allah then says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞáößó äóÌúÒöí ÇáúŞóæúãó ÇáúãõÌúÑöãöíäó</div><br>  (Thus do We recompense the criminal people!) which means that this is Our judgement regarding those who reject Our Messengers and disobey Our commands. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that she said, "I never saw Allah's Messenger fully laughing so that I would see his uvula. He would only smile.'' She added that when Allah's Messenger saw clouds or wind, that would reflect on his face (as discomfort). She asked him: "O Allah's Messenger! When the people see clouds, they become happy, hoping that they bring them rain. But I notice that when you see them, displeasure appears on your face.'' Allah's Messenger replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÚóÇÆöÔóÉõ¡ ãóÇ íõÄúãöäõäöí Ãóäú íóßõæäó İöíåö ÚóĞóÇÈñ¡ ŞóÏú ÚõĞøöÈó Şóæúãñ ÈöÇáÑøöíÍö¡ æóŞóÏú ÑóÃóì Şóæúãñ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó æóŞóÇáõæÇ: åĞóÇ ÚóÇÑöÖñ ãõãúØöÑõäóÇ»</div><br>  (O `A'ishah! What would guarantee to me that they do not bring punishment Some nations had been punished with wind. On seeing the punishment approaching them, a nation once said: "This is a cloud bringing us rain.'') This is also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said that when Allah's Messenger saw clouds on any of the horizons, he would leave whatever he was doing -- even if he was in prayer -- and say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó Åöäøöí ÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ãöäú ÔóÑøö ãóÇ İöíå»</div><br>  (O Allah! I seek refuge with you from any harm that it (the cloud) contains.) If Allah removed those clouds, the Prophet would praise Allah, and if rain fell, he would say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó ÕóíøöÈğÇ äóÇİöÚğÇ»</div><br>  (O Allah! Make it pouring and beneficent.) Muslim also recorded in his Sahih from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that when the wind blew, Allah's Messenger would say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó Åöäøöí ÃóÓúÃóáõßó ÎóíúÑóåóÇ æóÎóíúÑó ãóÇ İöíåóÇ æóÎóíúÑó ãóÇ ÃõÑúÓöáóÊú Èöåö¡æóÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ãöäú ÔóÑøöåóÇ¡ æóÔóÑøö ãóÇ İöíåóÇ¡ æóÔóÑøö ãóÇ ÃõÑúÓöáóÊú Èöå»</div><br>  (O Allah! I ask You of its good, the good that it contains, and the good with which it has been sent. And I seek refuge in You from its evil, the evil that it contains, and the evil with which it has been sent.) She added that if the sky became cloudy, his color would change; he would exit, enter, come, and go. When it rained, his anxiety would be relieved. When `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, noticed that, she asked him about it and he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÚóáøóåõ íóÇ ÚóÇÆöÔóÉõ ßóãóÇ ŞóÇáó Şóæúãõ ÚóÇÏò:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÃóæúåõ ÚóÇÑöÖÇğ ãøõÓúÊóŞúÈöáó ÃóæúÏöíóÊöåöãú ŞóÇáõæÇú åóÜĞóÇ ÚóÇÑöÖñ ãøõãúØöÑõäóÇ»</div><br>  (O `A'ishah! It could be like what the people of `Ad said, (Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud approaching their valleys, they said: "This is a cloud bringing us rain!'')) We have previously mentioned the story of the destruction of the people of `Ad in both Surat Al-A`raf and Surah Hud. Thus, there is no need to repeat it here; and verily Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude.  </div></body></html>
