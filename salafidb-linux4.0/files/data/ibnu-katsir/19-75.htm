This is in refutation of thier argument about their nice dwellings and splendid places of gathering. This is a challenge against the idolators who claim that they were following guidance in what they were doing. This is similar to the challenge that Allah mentions about the Jews when He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú Åöä ÒóÚãúÊõãú Ãóäøóßõãú ÃóæúáöíóÂÁõ áöáøóåö ãöä Ïõæäö ÇáäøóÇÓö İóÊóãóäøóæõÇú ÇáúãóæúÊó Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó</div><br>  (O you Jews! If you pretend that you are friends of Allah, to the exclusion of (all) other people, then long for death if you are truthful.) 62:6 Meaning, `Supplicate for death to come to those who are following falsehood among us if you truly claim to be upon the truth. If you are true, then this supplication will not harm you.' But they refused to do so. An extensive discussion of this has already preceded in Surat Al-Baqarah, and to Allah is the praise. Likewise, Allah mentioned the challenge that was given to the Christians in Surah Al `Imran, when they were persistent in their disbelief and continued in their transgression. They refused to give up their exaggerating claim that `Isa was the son of Allah. Therefore, Allah mentioned His arguments and proofs against the worship of `Isa, and that he was merely a creature like Adam. After this, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóäú ÍóÂÌøóßó İöíåö ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌóÂÁóßó ãöäó ÇáúÚöáúãö İóŞõáú ÊóÚóÇáóæúÇú äóÏúÚõ ÃóÈúäóÂÁóäóÇ æóÃóÈúäóÂÁóßõãú æóäöÓóÂÁóäóÇ æóäöÓóÂÁóßõãú æóÃóäİõÓóäóÇ æÃóäİõÓóßõãú Ëõãøó äóÈúÊóåöáú İóäóÌúÚóá áøóÚúäóÊõ Çááøóåö Úóáóì ÇáúßóÜĞöÈöíäó </div><br>  (Then whoever disputes with you about him after (all this) knowledge that has come to you, say: "Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves - then we pray and invoke (sincerely) the curse of Allah upon those who lie.'') 3:61 However, they (the Christians) also retreated from this challenge.  </div></body></html>
