Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÓúÜóáõ Íóãöíãñ ÍóãöíãÇğ íõÈóÕøóÑõæäóåõãú</div><br>  (And no friend will ask a friend (about his condition), though they shall be made to see one another) 70:10-11. meaning, no relative will ask about another relative, even if he can see him and even if he is carrying a heavy burden. Even if he was the dearest of people to him in this world, he will not care about him or take even the slightest part of his burden from him. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóİöÑøõ ÇáúãóÑúÁõ ãöäú ÃóÎöíåö - æóÃõãøöåö æóÃóÈöíåö - æóÕóÜÍöÈóÊöåõ æóÈóäöíåö </div><br>  (That Day shall a man flee from his brother. And from his mother and his father. And from his wife and his children.) 80:34-36 Ibn Mas`ud said, "On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will gather the first and the last, then a voice will call out, `Whoever is owed something by another, let him come forth and take it.' And a man will rejoice if he is owed something or had been mistreated by his father or child or wife, even if it is little. '' This is confirmed in the Book of Allah, where Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ äõİöÎó İöì ÇáÕøõæÑö İóáÇó ÃóäÓóÜÈó Èóíúäóåõãú íóæúãóÆöĞò æóáÇó íóÊóÓóÂÁóáõæäó </div><br>  (Then, when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another.) This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä ËóŞõáóÊú ãóæóÒöíäõåõ İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúãõİúáöÍõæäó </div><br>  (Then, those whose Scales are heavy, these! they are the successful.) means, the one whose good deeds outweigh his bad deeds, even by one. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúãõİúáöÍõæäó</div><br>  (they are the successful.) means, those who have attained victory and been saved from Hell and admitted to Paradise. Ibn `Abbas said, "These are the ones who have attained what they wanted and been saved from an evil from which there is no escape.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäú ÎóİøóÊú ãóæóÒöíäõåõ</div><br>  (And those whose Scales are light,) means, their evil deeds outweigh their good deeds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÎóÓöÑõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóåõã</div><br>  (they are those who lose themselves,) means, they are doomed and have ended up with the worst deal. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì Ìóåóäøóãó ÎóÜáöÏõæäó</div><br>  (in Hell will they abide. ) meaning, they will stay there forever and will never leave.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóáúİóÍõ æõÌõæåóåõãõ ÇáäøóÇÑõ</div><br>  (The Fire will burn their faces,) This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÛúÔóì æõÌõæåóåõãú ÇáäøóÇÑõ</div><br>  (and fire will cover their faces) 14:50. and:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú íóÚúáóãõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú Íöíäó áÇó íóßõİøõæäó Úóä æõÌõæåöåöãõ ÇáäøóÇÑó æóáÇó Úóä ÙõåõæÑöåöãú</div><br>  (If only those who disbelieved knew (the time) when they will not be able to ward off the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs) 21:39.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú İöíåóÇ ßóÜáöÍõæäó</div><br>  (and therein they will grin, with displaced lips.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated from Ibn `Abbas, "Frowning.''  </div></body></html>
