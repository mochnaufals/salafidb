Allah states that there are no inconsistencies, contradictions, conflicting statements or discrepancies in the Qur'an, because it is a revelation from the Most-Wise, Worthy of all praise. Therefore, the Qur'an is the truth coming from the Truth, Allah. This is why Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó íóÊóÏóÈøóÑõæäó ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäó Ãóãú Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈò ÃóŞúİóÇáõåóÂ </div><br>  (Do they not then think deeply in the Qur'an, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)) Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ßóÇäó ãöäú ÚöäÏö ÛóíúÑö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Had it been from other than Allah,) meaning, had it been fraudulent and made up, as the ignorant idolators and hypocrites assert in their hearts,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæóÌóÏõæÇú İöíåö ÇÎúÊöáóÜİÇğ</div><br>  (they would surely, have found therein contradictions), discrepancies and inconsistencies,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóËöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (in abundance). However, this Qur'an is free of shortcomings, and therefore, it is from Allah. Similarly, Allah describes those who are firmly grounded in knowledge,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Èöåö ßõáøñ ãøöäú ÚöäÏö ÑóÈøöäóÇ</div><br>  (We believe in it, all of it is from our Lord.)(3:7) meaning, the Muhkam sections (entirely clear) and the Mutashabih sections (not entirely clear) of the Qur'an are all true. So they understand the not entirely clear from the clear, and thus gain guidance. As for those in whose heart is the disease of hypocrisy, they understand the Muhkam from the Mutashabih; thus only gaining misguidance. Allah praised those who have knowledge and criticized the wicked. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father said that his grandfather said, "I and my brother were present in a gathering, which is more precious to me than red camels. My brother and I came and found that some of the leaders of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah were sitting close to a door of his. We did not like the idea of being separate from them, so we sat near the room. They then mentioned an Ayah and began disputing until they raised their voices. The Messenger of Allah was so angry that when he went out his face was red. He threw sand on them and said to them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóåúáğÇ íóÇ Şóæúãö¡ ÈöåóĞóÇ ÃõåúáößóÊö ÇáúÃõãóãõ ãöäú ŞóÈúáößõãú¡ ÈöÇÎúÊöáóÇİöåöãú Úóáì ÃóäúÈöíóÇÆöåöãú¡ æóÖóÑúÈöåöãö ÇáúßõÊõÈó ÈóÚúÖóåóÇ ÈöÈóÚúÖò¡ Åöäøó ÇáúŞõÑúÂäó áóãú íóäúÒöáú íõßóĞøöÈõ ÈóÚúÖõåõ ÈóÚúÖğÇ¡ ÅöäøóãóÇ íõÕóÏøöŞõ ÈóÚúÖõåõ ÈóÚúÖğÇ¡ İóãóÇ ÚóÑóİúÊõãú ãöäúåõ İóÇÚúãóáõæÇ Èöåö¡ æóãóÇ ÌóåöáúÊõãú ãöäúåõ İóÑõÏøõæåõ Åöáì ÚóÇáöãöå»</div><br>  (Behold, O people! This is how the nations before you were destroyed, because of their disputing with their Prophets and their contradicting parts of the Books with other parts. The Qur'an does not contradict itself. Rather, it testifies to the truth of itself. Therefore, whatever of it you have knowledge in, then implement it, and whatever you do not know of it, then refer it to those who have knowledge in it. )" Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, "I went to the Messenger of Allah one day. When we were sitting, two men disputed about an Ayah, and their voices became loud. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöäøóãóÇ åóáóßóÊö ÇáúÃõãóãõ ŞóÈúáóßõãú ÈöÇÎúÊöáóÇİöåöãú İöí ÇáúßöÊóÇÈ»</div><br>  (Verily, the nations before you were destroyed because of their disagreements over the Book.) Muslim and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Prohibition of Disclosing Unreliable and Uninvestigated News</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõãú ÃóãúÑñ ãøöäó ÇáÇøñãúäö Ãóæö ÇáúÎóæúİö ÃóĞóÇÚõæÇú Èöåö</div><br>  (When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people);) chastising those who indulge in things before being sure of their truth, disclosing them, making them known and spreading their news, even though such news might not be true at all. In the introduction to his Sahih, Imam Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóİóì ÈöÇáúãóÑúÁö ßóĞöÈğÇ Ãóäú íõÍóÏøöËó Èößõáøö ãóÇ ÓóãöÚ»</div><br>  (Narrating everything one hears is sufficient to make a person a liar.) This is the same narration collected by Abu Dawud in the section of Adab (manners) in his Sunan. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah said that the Messenger of Allah prohibited, "It was said,'' and, "So-and-so said.'' This Hadith refers to those who often convey the speech that people utter without investigating the reliability and truth of what he is disclosing. The Sahih also records,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÍóÏøóËó ÈöÍóÏöíËò æóåõæó íõÑóì Ãóäøóåõ ßóĞöÈñ¡ İóåõæó ÃóÍóÏõ ÇáúßóÇĞöÈóíúä»</div><br>  (Whoever narrates a Hadith while knowing it is false, then he is one of the two liars (who invents and who spreads the lie).) We should mention here the Hadith of `Umar bin Al-Khattab collected in the Two Sahihs. When `Umar was informed that the Messenger of Allah divorced his wives, he came from his house, entered the Masjid and found the people talking about this news. He could not wait and went to the Prophet to ask him about what had truly happened, asking him, "Have you divorced your wives'' The Prophet said, "No.'' `Umar said, "I said, Allahu Akbar...'' and mentioned the rest of the Hadith. In the narration that Muslim collected, `Umar said, "I asked, `Have you divorced them' He said, `No.' So, I stood by the door of the Masjid and shouted with the loudest voice, `The Messenger of Allah did not divorce his wives.' Then, this Ayah was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõãú ÃóãúÑñ ãøöäó ÇáÇøñãúäö Ãóæö ÇáúÎóæúİö ÃóĞóÇÚõæÇú Èöåö æóáóæú ÑóÏøõæåõ Åöáóì ÇáÑøóÓõæáö æóÅöáóì Ãõæúáöì ÇáÇøñãúÑö ãöäúåõãú áóÚóáöãóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÓúÊóäúÈöØõæäóåõ ãöäúåõãú</div><br>  (When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people), if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly).) So I properly investigated that matter.''  This Ayah refers to proper investigation, or extraction of matters from their proper resources. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇóÊøóÈóÚúÊõãõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäó ÅöáÇøó ŞóáöíáÇğ</div><br>  (you would have followed Shaytan except a few of you. ) refers to the believers, as `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas.  </div></body></html>
