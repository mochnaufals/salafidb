Verily, Allah gives you the glad tidings of a Word from Him,) a son who will come into existence with a word from Allah, `Be', and he was. This is the meaning of Allah's statement (about Yahya)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÕóÏøöŞÇğ ÈößóáöãóÉò ãøöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Believing in the Word from Allah.) 3:39, according to the majority of the scholars.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÓúãõåõ ÇáúãóÓöíÍõ ÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäõ ãóÑúíóãó</div><br>  (His name will be Al-Masih, `Isa, the son of Maryam) and he will be known by this name in this life, especially by the believers. `Isa was called "Al-Masih'' (the Messiah) because when he touched (Mash) those afflicted with an illness, they would be healed by Allah's leave. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäó ãóÑúíóãó</div><br>  (`Isa, the son of Maryam) relates `Isa to his mother, because he did not have a father.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌöíåğÇ İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö æóãöäó ÇáúãõŞóÑøóÈöíäó</div><br>  (Held in honor in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allah.) meaning, he will be a leader and honored by Allah in this life, because of the Law that Allah will reveal to him, sending down the Scripture to him, along with the other bounties that Allah will grant him with. `Isa will be honored in the Hereafter and will intercede with Allah, by His leave, on behalf of some people, just as is the case with his brethren the mighty Messengers of Allah, peace be upon them all. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>`Isa Spoke When He was Still in the Cradle</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõßóáøöãõ ÇáäøóÇÓó İöì ÇáúãóåúÏö æóßóåúáÇğ</div><br>  (He will speak to the people, in the cradle and in manhood,) calling to the worship of Allah Alone without partners, while still in the cradle, as a miracle from Allah, and when he is a man, by Allah's revelation to him.  Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ Êóßóáøóãó ãóæúáõæÏñ İöí ÕöÛóÑöåö ÅöáøóÇ ÚöíÓóì æóÕóÇÍöÈõ ÌõÑóíúÌ»</div><br>  (No infant spoke in the cradle except `Isa and the companion of Jurayj.)  Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóãú íóÊóßóáøóãú İöí ÇáúãóåúÏö ÅöáøóÇ ËóáóÇËóÉñ: ÚöíÓóì¡ æóÕóÈöíøñ ßóÇäó İöí Òóãóäö ÌõÑóíúÌò¡ æóÕóÈöíøñ ÂÎóÑ»</div><br>  (No infant spoke in the cradle except three, `Isa, the boy during the time of Jurayj, and another boy.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó</div><br>  (And he will be one of the righteous.) in his statements and actions, for he will possess, pure knowledge and righteous works. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>`Isa was Created Without a Father</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  When Maryam heard the good news that the angels conveyed from Allah, she said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö Ãóäøóì íóßõæäõ áöì æóáóÏñ æóáóãú íóãúÓóÓúäöì ÈóÔóÑñ</div><br>  ("O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me.'')  Mary said, "How can I have a son while I did not marry, nor intend to marry, nor am I an indecent woman, may Allah forbid'' The angel conveyed to Maryam, Allah's answer,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó Çááøóåõ íóÎúáõŞõ ãóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (So (it will be) for Allah creates what He wills.)  He is Mighty in power and nothing escapes His ability. Allah used the word `create' here instead of the word `does' as in the tale about Zakariyya 3:40, to eradicate any evil thought concerning `Isa. Allah next emphasized this fact when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ŞóÖóì ÃóãúÑğÇ İóÅöäøóãóÇ íóŞõæáõ áóåõ ßõä İóíóßõæäõ</div><br>  (When He has decreed something, He says to it only: "Be!

In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóãúÑõäóÂ ÅöáÇøó æóÍöÏóÉñ ßóáóãúÍò ÈöÇáúÈóÕóÑö </div><br>  (And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) 54:50, meaning, "We only issue the command once, and it comes into existence instantly, as fast as, and faster than, a blink of the eye.
