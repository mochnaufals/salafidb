However, the first view is the popular opinion. Thus, Allah swears by this, that man is in Khusr, which means in loss and destruction.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö</div><br>  (Except those who believe and do righteous good deeds) So Allah makes an exception, among the species of man being in loss, for those who believe in their hearts and work righteous deeds with their limbs.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóæóÇÕóæúÇú ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (And recommend one another to the truth,) This is to perform acts of obedience and avoid the forbidden things.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóæóÇÕóæúÇú ÈöÇáÕøóÈúÑö</div><br>  (And recommend one another to patience.) meaning, with the plots, the evils, and the harms of those who harm people due to their commanding them to do good and forbidding them from evil. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-`Asr, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
