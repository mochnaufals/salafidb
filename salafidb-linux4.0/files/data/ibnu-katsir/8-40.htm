Al-Bukhari recorded that a man came to Ibn `Umar and said to him, "O Abu `Abdur-Rahman!

What prevents you from fighting as Allah mentioned in His Book'' Ibn `Umar said, "O my nephew!

Ibn `Umar said, "We did that during the time of the Messenger of Allah, when Islam was weak and the man would be tried in religion, either tormented to death or being imprisoned. When Islam became stronger and widespread, there was no more Fitnah.'' When the man realized that Ibn `Umar would not agree to what he is saying, he asked him, "What do you say about `Ali and `Uthman'' Ibn `Umar replied, "What do I say about `Ali and `Uthman! As for `Uthman, Allah has forgiven him, but you hate that Allah forgives him. As for `Ali, he is the cousin of the Messenger of Allah and his son-in-law,'' and he pointed with his hand saying, "And this is his house over there.'' Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "Ibn `Umar came to us and was asked, "What do you say about fighting during Fitnah'' Ibn `Umar said, "Do you know what Fitnah refers to Muhammad was fighting against the idolators, and at that time, attending (or residing with) the idolators was a Fitnah (trial in religion). It is nothing like what you are doing, fighting to gain leadership!'' All these narrations were collected by Al-Bukhari, may Allah the Exalted grant him His mercy. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÜÊöáõæåõãú ÍóÊøóì áÇó Êóßõæäó İöÊúäóÉñ</div><br>  (And fight them until there is no more Fitnah...) "So that there is no more Shirk.'' Similar was said by Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Zayd bin Aslam. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that he was informed from Az-Zuhri, from `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr and other scholars that   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì áÇó Êóßõæäó İöÊúäóÉñ</div><br>  (until there is no more Fitnah) the Fitnah mentioned here means, until no Muslim is persecuted so that he abandons his religion. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóßõæäó ÇáÏøöíäõ ßõáøõåõ áöáåö</div><br>  (and the religion (worship) will all be for Allah alone.)

Muhammad bin Ishaq also commented on this Ayah, "So that Tawhid is practiced in sincerity towards Allah, without Shirk, all the while shunning all rivals who (are being worshipped) besides Him.''  `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said about,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóßõæäó ÇáÏøöíäõ ßõáøõåõ áöáåö</div><br>  (and the religion will all be for Allah alone) "So that there is no more Kufr (disbelief) with your religion remains.'' There is a Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs that testifies to this explanation. The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃõãöÑúÊõ Ãóäú ÃõŞóÇÊöáó ÇáäøóÇÓó¡ ÍóÊøóì íóŞõæáõæÇ: áóÇ Åöáóåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ŞóÇáõæåóÇ ÚóÕóãõæÇ ãöäøöí ÏöãóÇÁóåõãú æóÃóãúæóÇáóåõãú¡ ÅöáøóÇ ÈöÍóŞøöåóÇ¡ æóÍöÓóÇÈõåõãú Úóáóì Çááåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóá»</div><br>  (I was commanded to fight against the people until they proclaim, `There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.' If and when they say it, they will preserve their blood and wealth from me, except for its right (Islamic penal code), and their reckoning is with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.)  Also, in the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said, "The Messenger of Allah was asked about a man who fights because he is courageous, in prejudice with his people, or to show off. Which of these is for the cause of Allah He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ŞóÇÊóáó áöÊóßõæäó ßóáöãóÉõ Çááåö åöíó ÇáúÚõáúíóÇ İóåõæó İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóá»</div><br>  (Whoever fights so that Allah's Word is the supreme, is in the cause of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.)''
