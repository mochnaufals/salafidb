Allah the Exalted sent down this Surah, including this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú åóáú ÃóÏõáøõßãú Úóáóì ÊöÌóÜÑóÉò ÊõäÌöíßõã ãøöäú ÚóĞóÇÈò Ãóáöíãò </div><br>  (O you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment) Allah then explained this great trade that will never fail, the trade that will earn one what he wishes and saves him from what he dislikes. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóÑóÓõæáöåö æóÊõÌóÜåöÏõæäó İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö ÈöÃóãúæóáößõãú æóÃóäİõÓößõãú Ğóáößõãú ÎóíúÑñ áøóßõãú Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (That you believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, that will be better for you, if you but know!) this is better than the trade of this life and striving hard for it and amassing it. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÛúİöÑú áóßõãú ĞõäõæÈóßõãú</div><br>  (He will forgive you your sins,) meaning, `if you fulfill what I commanded you and guided you to, then I will forgive your sins and admit you into the Gardens of Paradise. In them, you will have exalted residences and high postitions.' This is why Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÏúÎöáúßõãú ÌóäøóÜÊò ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÇ ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ æóãóÓóÜßöäó ØóíøöÈóÉğ İöì ÌóäøóÜÊö ÚóÏúäò Ğóáößó ÇáúİóæúÒõ ÇáúÚóÙöíãõ</div><br>  (and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in `Adn (Eternal) Paradise; that is indeed the great success.) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõÎúÑóì ÊõÍöÈøõæäóåóÇ</div><br>  (And also another (blessing) which you love,) meaning, `I will grant you more favors that you like,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÕúÑñ ãøöä Çááøóåö æóİóÊúÍñ ŞóÑöíÈñ</div><br>  (help from Allah and a near victory.) meaning, if you fight in Allah's cause and support His religion, He will grant you victory. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú Åöä ÊóäÕõÑõæÇú Çááøóåó íóäÕõÑúßõãú æóíõËóÈøöÊú ÃóŞúÏóÇãóßõãú </div><br>  (O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm.) (47:7), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóíóäÕõÑóäøó Çááøóåõ ãóä íóäÕõÑõåõ Åöäøó Çááøóåó áóŞóæöìøñ ÚóÒöíÒñ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah will help those who help His (cause). Truly, Allah is All Strong, All-Wise.) (22:40) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİóÊúÍñ ŞóÑöíÈñ</div><br>  (and a near victory.) means, it will come sooner, and this is the increased favor that is earned in this life and continues, becoming the delight of the Hereafter. It is for those who obey Allah and His Messenger and support Allah and His religion. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóÔøöÑö ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  (And give glad tidings to the believers.)  </div></body></html>
