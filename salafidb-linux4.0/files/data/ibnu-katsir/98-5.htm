Mujahid said, they are not going   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõäİóßøöíäó</div><br>  (to leave) "Meaning, they will not be finished until the truth becomes clear to them.'' Qatadah also said the same thing.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÊóÃúÊöíóåõãõ ÇáúÈóíøöäóÉõ</div><br>  (until there came to them the Bayyinah.) meaning, this Qur'an. This is why Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóãú íóßõäö ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö æóÇáúãõÔúÑößöíäó ãõäİóßøöíäó ÍóÊøóì ÊóÃúÊöíóåõãõ ÇáúÈóíøöäóÉõ </div><br>  (Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture and idolators, were not going to leave until there came to them the Bayyinah.) Then He explains what the Bayyinah is by His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÓõæáñ ãøöäó Çááøóåö íóÊúáõæ ÕõÍõİÇğ ãøõØóåøóÑóÉğ </div><br>  (A Messenger from Allah, reciting purified pages.) meaning, Muhammad and the Magnificent Qur'an he recites, which is written down among the most high gathering in purified pages. This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóì ÕõÍõİò ãøõßóÑøóãóÉò - ãøóÑúİõæÚóÉò ãøõØóåøóÑóÉò - ÈöÃóíúÏöì ÓóİóÑóÉò - ßöÑóÇãò ÈóÑóÑóÉò </div><br>  (In Records held in honor.

(80:13-16) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåóÇ ßõÊõÈñ ŞóíøöãóÉñ </div><br>  (Wherein are upright Books.) Ibn Jarir said, "Meaning in the purified pages are Books from Allah that are upright, just and straight. They have no mistakes in them because they are from Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Differing only occurred after the Knowledge came</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊóİóÑøóŞó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ÅöáÇøó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãõ ÇáúÈóíøöäóÉõ </div><br>  (And the People of the Scripture differed not until after there came to them the Bayyinah.)

It is they for whom there is an awful torment.) (3:105) This refers to the people of those divinely revealed Scriptures that were sent down to the nations that were before us. After Allah established the proofs and evidences against them, they divided and differed concerning that which Allah had intended in their Scriptures, and they had many differences. This is like what has been reported in a Hadith that has many routes of transmission,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáúíóåõæÏó ÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇ Úóáóì ÅöÍúÏóì æóÓóÈúÚöíäó İöÑúŞóÉğ¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáäøóÕóÇÑóì ÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇ Úóáì ËöäúÊóíúäö æóÓóÈúÚöíäó İöÑúŞóÉğ¡ æóÓóÊóİúÊóÑöŞõ åóĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉõ Úóáóì ËóáóÇËò æóÓóÈúÚöíäó İöÑúŞóÉğ¡ ßõáøõåóÇ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑö ÅöáøóÇ æóÇÍöÏóÉ»</div><br>  (Verily, the Jews differed until they became seventy-one sects. And verily, the Christians differed until they became seventy-two sects. And this Ummah will divide into seventy-three sects, and all of them will be in the Fire except one.) They said, "Who are they, O Messenger of Allah'' He replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÃóäóÇ Úóáóíúåö æóÃóÕúÍóÇÈöí»</div><br>  ((Those who are upon) what I and my Companions are upon.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command of Allah was merely that They make their Religion solely for Him</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃõãöÑõæÇú ÅöáÇøó áöíóÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó ãõÎúáöÕöíäó áóåõ ÇáÏøöíäó</div><br>  (And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, making religion purely for Him alone,) This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ãöä ÑøóÓõæáò ÅöáÇøó äõæÍöì Åöáóíúåö Ãóäøóåõ áÇ ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó ÃóäóÇú İóÇÚúÈõÏõæäö </div><br>  (And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him: La ilaha illa Ana.) (21:25) Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍõäóİóÂÁó</div><br>  (Hunafa') meaning, avoiding Shirk and being truly devout to Tawhid. This is like Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÈóÚóËúäóÇ İöì ßõáøö ÃõãøóÉò ÑøóÓõæáÇğ Ãóäö ÇÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáúØøóÜÛõæÊó</div><br>  (And Verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): "Worship Allah, and avoid the Taghut (false deities).'') (16:36) A discussion of the word Hanif has already been mentioned previously and in Surat Al-An`am, so there is no need to repeat it here.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõŞöíãõæÇú ÇáÕøóáóæÉó</div><br>  (and perform Salah) And this is the best of the physical forms of worship.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÄúÊõæÇú ÇáÒøóßóæÉó</div><br>  (and give Zakah,) This is doing good to the poor and the needy.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóĞóáößó Ïöíäõ ÇáŞóíøöãóÉö</div><br>  (and that is the right religion.) meaning, the upright and just religion, or the nation that is straight and balanced.  </div></body></html>
