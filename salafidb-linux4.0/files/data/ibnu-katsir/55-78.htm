We previously mentioned the Hadith stating that there are two gardens made of gold, their vessels and all they contain, and there are two gardens made of silver, their vessels and all they contain. The first two are for the near believers (Muqarribin) and the latter two are for those on the right (Ashab Al-Yamin). Abu Musa commented, "There are two gardens made of gold for the Muqarribin and two gardens made of silver for Ashab Al-Yamin.'' There are several proofs that the former two gardens in Paradise are better in grade than the latter. Allah mentioned the former two gardens before the latter two, thus indicating their significance, then He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ÏõæäöåöãóÇ ÌóäøóÊóÇäö </div><br>  (And below these two, there are two other Gardens.) And this is an obvious form of honoring the first two gardens over the latter two. Allah described the former gardens:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ĞóæóÇÊóÂ ÃóİúäóÇäò </div><br>  (With Afnan), which are the extending branches, as we explained, or various types of delights. But He said about the latter two gardens,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÏúåóÂãøóÊóÇäö </div><br>  (Mudhammatan), being dark, because of the intense irrigation. Ibn `Abbas said, "Mudhammatan means, they have become dark green because of extensive water irrigation.'' Muhammad bin Ka`b said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÏúåóÂãøóÊóÇäö </div><br>  (Mudhammatan) "Full of greenery.'' There is no doubt that the former two gardens are better, their branches are fresh, youthful and intermingling.  Allah said about the former two gardens,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåöãóÇ ÚóíúäóÇäö ÊóÌúÑöíóÇäö </div><br>  (In them (both) will be two springs flowing (free)), while He said about the springs of the latter two gardens,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÖøóÇÎóÊóÇäö</div><br>  (Naddakhatan); `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: "It means gushing. And the free flowing is stronger than gushing.'' Ad-Dahhak said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÖøóÇÎóÊóÇäö</div><br>  (gushing forth) means, they are full of water and constantly gushing. Allah said about the former two gardens,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåöãóÇ ãöä ßõáøö İóÜßöåóÉò ÒóæúÌóÇäö </div><br>  (In them (both) will be every kind of fruit in pairs), but He said about the latter two gardens,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåöãóÇ İóÜßöåóÉñ æóäóÎúáñ æóÑõãøóÇäñ </div><br>  (In them (both) will be fruits, and date palms and pomegranates.) There is no doubt that the first description is better and refers to more of a variety and more types of fruit. Allah said about the latter two gardens, Allah then said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåöäøó ÎóíúÑóÊñ ÍöÓóÇäñ </div><br>  (Therein will be Khayrat Hisan;) meaning, there are various types of good and delightful things in these two gardens in Paradise, according to Qatadah. It was also said that Khayrat is plural of Khayrah and it is a righteous, well-mannered, beautiful woman, according to the majority of scholars, and it is also reported from Umm Salamah as a Hadith from the Prophet . There is another Hadith saying that Al-Hur Al-`Ayn will sing,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÍúäõ ÇáúÎóíúÑóÇÊõ ÇáúÍöÓóÇäõ¡ ÎõáöŞúäóÇ áöÃóÒúæóÇÌò ßöÑóÇã»</div><br>  ("We are Al-Khayrat Al-Hisan, we were created for honorable husbands.'') Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍõæÑñ ãøóŞúÕõæÑóÊñ İöì ÇáúÎöíóÇãö </div><br>  (Hur (beautiful, fair females) guarded in pavilions;) but He said about the first two gardens,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåöäøó ŞóÜÕöÑóÊõ ÇáØøóÑúİö</div><br>  (Wherein both will be Qasirat At-Tarf,) There is no doubt that the chaste wives that restrain their glances themselves, are better than those guarded in pavilions even though both are secluded. About Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÇáúÎöíóÇãö</div><br>  (in pavilions;) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Qays said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÎóíúãóÉğ ãöäú áõÄúáõÄóÉò ãõÌóæøóİóÉò¡ ÚóÑúÖõåóÇ ÓöÊøõæäó ãöíáğÇ¡ İöí ßõáøö ÒóÇæöíóÉò ãöäúåóÇ Ãóåúáñ¡ ãóÇ íóÑóæúäó ÇáúÇÎóÑöíäó íóØõæİõ Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæä»</div><br>  (Verily, in Paradise, the believer will have a tent from a hollow pearl, the width thereof is sixty miles. In each corner of it there are wives for the believer that do not see the other wives, and the believer will visit them all.) In another narration the Prophet said that this tent is thirty miles wide. Muslim recorded this Hadith and in his narration, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó áöáúãõÄúãöäö İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö áóÎóíúãóÉğ ãöäú áõÄúáõÄóÉò æóÇÍöÏóÉò ãõÌóæøóİóÉò¡ ØõæáõåóÇ ÓöÊøõæäó ãöíáğÇ¡ áöáúãõÄúãöäö İöíåóÇ Ãóåúáñ íóØõæİõ Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõ İóáóÇ íóÑóì ÈóÚúÖõåõãú ÈóÚúÖğÇ»</div><br>  (Verily in Paradise, the believer will have a tent made of a hollow pearl the length thereof being sixty miles. In it, the believer will have wives who do not see each other, and the believer will visit them all.) Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóãú íóØúãöËúåõäøó ÅöäÓñ ŞóÈúáóåõãú æóáÇó ÌóÂäøñ </div><br>  (Whom never were deflowered by a human before nor Jinn.) We explained this meaning before. Allah added in the description of the first group of the believers' wives,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÃóäøóåõäøó ÇáúíóÇŞõæÊõ æóÇáúãóÑúÌóÇäõ İóÈöÃóìøö ÁóÇáÇÁö ÑóÈøößõãóÇ ÊõßóĞøöÈóÇäö </div><br>  (they are like Yaqut (rubies) and Marjan (pearls). Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÊøóßöÆöíäó Úóáóì ÑóİúÑóİò ÎõÖúÑò æóÚóÈúŞóÑöìøò ÍöÓóÇäò </div><br>  (Reclining on green Rafraf and rich beautiful `Abqariy. ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas: "Rafraf means cushions.'' Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others also said that Rafraf means cushions. Al-`Ala' bin Badr said: "The Rafraf are arrayed hanging over the couches.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóÈúŞóÑöìøò ÍöÓóÇäò</div><br>  (and rich beautiful `Abqariy.) Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said that `Abqariy means rich carpets. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÈóÜÑóßó ÇÓúãõ ÑóÈøößó Ğöì ÇáúÌóáóÜáö æóÇáÅößúÑóÇãö </div><br>  (Blessed be the Name of your Lord (Allah) Dhil-Jalal wal-Ikram,)  Allah states that He is Worthy of being honored and always obeyed, revered and thus worshipped, appreciated and never unappreciated, and remembered and never forgotten. `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğöì ÇáúÌóáóÜáö æóÇáÅößúÑóÇãö</div><br>  (Dhil-Jalal wal-Ikram) means, the Owner of greatness and pride. In a Hadith, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ãöäú ÅöÌúáóÇáö Çááåö ÅößúÑóÇãõ Ğöí ÇáÔøóíúÈóÉö ÇáúãõÓúáöãö¡ æóĞöí ÇáÓøõáúØóÇäö¡ æóÍóÇãöáö ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö ÛóíúÑö ÇáúÛóÇáöí İöíåö¡ æóáóÇ ÇáúÌóÇİöí Úóäúå»</div><br>  (Verily, among the acts of venerating Allah, are honoring the elderly Muslims, the one in authority, and carrier (memorizer) of the Qur'an who avoids extremism and laziness with it.'' Imam Ahmad recorded that Rabi`ah bin `Amir said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáöÙøõæÇ ÈöĞöí ÇáúÌóáóÇáö æóÇáúÅößúÑóÇã»</div><br>  (Persist (in invoking Allah) with, "Ya Dhal-Jalal wal-Ikram (O Owner of greatness and honor).'') An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith. Muslim and the Four Sunan compilers recorded that `A'ishah said, "When the Messenger of Allah would (say the) Salam (completing prayer), he would only sit as long as it takes him to say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó ÃóäúÊó ÇáÓøóáóÇãõ æóãöäúßó ÇáÓøóáóÇãõ¡ ÊóÈóÇÑóßúÊó íóÇĞóÇ ÇáúÌóáóÇáö æóÇáúÅößúÑóÇã»</div><br>  (O Allah! You are As-Salam, and peace comes from You. Blessed be You Ya Dhal-Jalal wal-Ikram.).'' This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ar-Rahman, all praise is due to Allah and all favors come from Him.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
