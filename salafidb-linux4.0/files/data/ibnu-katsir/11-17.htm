This is based upon their confession to Him that there is none worthy of worship except He. This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóŞöãú æóÌúåóßó áöáÏøöíäö ÍóäöíİÇğ İöØúÑóÉó Çááøóåö ÇáøóÊöì İóØóÑó ÇáäøóÇÓó ÚóáóíúåóÇ</div><br>  (So set you your face towards the religion, Hanifan. Allah's Fitrah with which He has created mankind.) 30:30, In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáøõ ãóæúáõæÏò íõæáóÏõ Úóáóì ÇáúİöØúÑóÉö İóÃóÈóæóÇåõ íõåóæøöÏóÇäöåö Ãóæú íõäóÕøöÑóÇäöåö Ãóæú íõãóÌøöÓóÇäöåö ßóãóÇ ÊõæáóÏõ ÇáúÈóåöíãóÉõ ÈóåöíãóÉğ ÌóãúÚóÇÁó åóáú ÊõÍöÓøõæäó İöíåóÇ ãöäú ÌóÏúÚóÇÁó¿»</div><br>  (Every child is born upon the Fitrah, but his parents make him a Jew, Christian, or Magian. This is just as the calf that is born whole. Have you noticed any calves that are born mutilated) In Sahih Muslim it is recorded that `Iyad bin Himar said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì: Åöäøöí ÎóáóŞúÊõ ÚöÈóÇÏöí ÍõäóİóÇÁó İóÌóÇÁóÊúåõãõ ÇáÔøóíóÇØöíäõ İóÇÌúÊóÇáóÊúåõãú Úóäú Ïöíäåöãú æóÍóÑøóãóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ãóÇ ÃóÍúáóáúÊõ áóåõãú¡æóÃóãóÑóÊúåõãú Ãóäú íõÔúÑößõæÇ Èöí ãóÇ áóãú ÃõäúÒöáú Èöåö ÓõáúØóÇäğÇ»</div><br>  (Allah, the Exalted, says, `Verily, I created my servants Hunafa', but the devils came to them and distracted them from their religion. They made unlawful for them what I had made lawful for them and they commanded them to associate partners with Me, concerning which no authority has been revealed.)  Therefore, the believer is one who remains upon this Fitrah. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÊúáõæåõ ÔóÇåöÏñ ãøöäúåõ</div><br>  (and whom a witness from Him recites (follows) it;) This means that a witness comes to him from Allah. That witness is the pure, perfect and magnificent legislation that Allah revealed to the Prophets. These legislations were finalized with the legislation (Shari`ah) of Muhammad . The believer has the natural disposition that bears witness to (the truth of) the general legislation, and accepts that specific laws are taken from the general legislation. The Fitrah accepts the Shari`ah and believes in it. For this reason Allah, the Exalted, says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóİóãóä ßóÇäó Úóáóì ÈóíøöäóÉò ãøöä ÑøóÈøöåö æóíóÊúáõæåõ ÔóÇåöÏñ ãøöäúåõ</div><br>  (Can they who rely on a clear proof from their Lord, and whom a witness from Him recites (follows) it;) This clear proof which is recited is the Qur'an, which Jibril conveyed to the Prophet and the Prophet Muhammad conveyed it to his Ummah. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ŞóÈúáöåö ßöÊóÇÈõ ãõæÓóì</div><br>  (and before it, came the Book of Musa,) This means that before the Qur'an, there was the Book of Musa, the Tawrah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅóãóÇãğÇ æóÑóÍúãóÉğ</div><br>  (a guidance and a mercy) This means that Allah, the Exalted, revealed it to that Ummah as a leader for them and a guide for them to follow, as a mercy from Allah upon them. Therefore, whoever believed in it with true faith, then it would lead him to believe in the Qur'an as well. For this reason Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó íõÄúãöäõæäó Èöåö</div><br>  (they believe therein) Then Allah, the Exalted, threatens those who reject the Qur'an, or any part of it, by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóßúİõÑú Èöåö ãöäó ÇáÇøñÍúÒóÇÈö İóÇáäøóÇÑõ ãóæúÚöÏõåõ</div><br>  (but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place.) This is directed towards everyone on the face of the earth who disbelieves in the Qur'an, whether they are idolators, disbelievers, People of the Scripture, or other sects from the descendants of Adam. This applies to all whom the Qur'an reaches, regardless of their differences in color, appearance, or nationality.

(The narrator said, "Or he said, `I found its verification in the Qur'an.''') Thus, it reached me that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóÓúãóÚõ Èöí ÃóÍóÏñ ãöäú åóĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉö íóåõæÏöíøñ æóáóÇ äóÕúÑóÇäöíøñ Ëõãøó áóÇ íõÄúãöäõ Èöí ÅöáøóÇ ÏóÎóáó ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (There is no one of this Ummah, whether he be a Jew or Christian, who hears of me and does not believe in me, except that he will enter the Hellfire.)
