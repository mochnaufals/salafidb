"Was revealed about `Abdullah bin Hudhafah bin Qays bin `Adi, who the Messenger of Allah sent on a military expedition.'' This statement was collected by the Group, with the exception of Ibn Majah At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan, Gharib''. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali said, "The Messenger of Allah sent a troop under the command of a man from Al-Ansar. When they left, he became angry with them for some reason and said to them, `Has not the Messenger of Allah commanded you to obey me' They said, `Yes.' He said, `Collect some wood,' and then he started a fire with the wood, saying, `I command you to enter the fire.' The people almost entered the fire, but a young man among them said, `You only ran away from the Fire to Allah's Messenger. Therefore, do not rush until you go back to Allah's Messenger, and if he commands you to enter it, then enter it.' When they went back to Allah's Messenger , they told him what had happened, and the Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú ÏóÎóáúÊõãõæåóÇ ãóÇ ÎóÑóÌúÊõãú ãöäúåóÇ ÃóÈóÏğÇ¡ ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáØøóÇÚóÉõ İöí ÇáúãóÚúÑõæİ»</div><br>  (Had you entered it, you would never have departed from it. Obedience is only in righteousness.)'' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÓøóãúÚõ æóÇáØøóÇÚóÉõ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÑúÁö ÇáúãõÓúáöãö İöíãóÇ ÃóÍóÈøó æóßóÑöåó¡ ãóÇ áóãú íõÄúãóÑú ÈöãóÚúÕöíóÉò¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ÃõãöÑó ÈöãóÚúÕöíóÉò İóáóÇ ÓóãúÚó æóáóÇ ØóÇÚóÉ»</div><br>  (The Muslim is required to hear and obey in that which he likes and dislikes, unless he was commanded to sin. When he is commanded with sin, then there is no hearing or obeying.) This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. `Ubadah bin As-Samit said, "We gave our pledge to Allah's Messenger to hear and obey (our leaders), while active and otherwise, in times of ease and times of difficulty, even if we were deprived of our due shares, and to not dispute this matter (leadership) with its rightful people. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöáøóÇ Ãóäú ÊóÑóæúÇ ßõİúÑğÇ ÈóæóÇÍğÇ¡ ÚöäúÏóßõãú İöíåö ãöäó Çááåö ÈõÑúåóÇä»</div><br>  (Except when you witness clear Kufr about which you have clear proof from Allah.)''  This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Another Hadith narrated by Anas states that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÓúãóÚõæÇ æóÃóØöíÚõæÇ¡ æóÅöäú ÃõãøöÑó Úóáóíúßõãú ÚóÈúÏñÍóÈóÔöíøñ ßóÃóäøó ÑóÃúÓóåõ ÒóÈöíÈóÉ»</div><br>  (Hear and obey (your leaders), even if an Ethiopian slave whose head is like a raisin, is made your chief.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith. Umm Al-Husayn said that she heard the Messenger of Allah giving a speech during the Farewell Hajj, in which he said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóáóæö ÇÓúÊõÚúãöáó Úóáóíúßõãú ÚóÈúÏñíóŞõæÏõßõãú ÈößöÊóÇÈö Çááåö¡ ÇÓúãóÚõæÇ áóåõ æóÃóØöíÚõæÇ»</div><br>  (Even if a slave was appointed over you, and he rules you with Allah's Book, then listen to him and obey him.) Muslim recorded this Hadith. In another narration with Muslim, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÚóÈúÏğÇ ÍóÈóÔöíøğÇ ãóÌúÏõæÚğÇ»</div><br>  (Even if an Ethiopian slave, whose nose was mutilated...) In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóØóÇÚóäöí İóŞóÏú ÃóØóÇÚó Çááåó¡ æóãóäú ÚóÕóÇäöí İóŞóÏú ÚóÕóì Çááåó¡ æóãóäú ÃóØóÇÚó ÃóãöíÑöí İóŞóÏú ÃóØóÇÚóäöí¡ æóãóäú ÚóÕóì ÃóãöíÑöí İóŞóÏú ÚóÕóÇäöí»</div><br>  (Whoever obeys me, obeys Allah, and whoever disobeys me, disobeys Allah. Whoever obeys my commander, obeys me, and whoever disobeys my commander, disobeys me.) This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóØöíÚõæÇú Çááøóåó</div><br>  (Obey Allah), adhere to His Book,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóØöíÚõæÇú ÇáÑøóÓõæáó</div><br>  (and obey the Messenger), adhere to his Sunnah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõæúáöì ÇáÇøñãúÑö ãöäúßõãú</div><br>  (And those of you who are in authority) in the obedience to Allah which they command you, not what constitutes disobedience of Allah, for there is no obedience to anyone in disobedience to Allah, as we mentioned in the authentic Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáØøóÇÚóÉõ İöí ÇáúãóÚúÑõæİ»</div><br>  (Obedience is only in righteousness.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Necessity of Referring to the Qur'an and Sunnah for Judgment</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä ÊóäóÇÒóÚúÊõãú İöì ÔóìúÁò İóÑõÏøõæåõ Åöáóì Çááøóåö æóÇáÑøóÓõæáö</div><br>  ((And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger). Mujahid and several others among the Salaf said that the Ayah means, "(Refer) to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger.'' This is a command from Allah that whatever areas the people dispute about, whether major or minor areas of the religion, they are required to refer to the Qur'an and Sunnah for judgment concerning these disputes. In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÇÎúÊóáóİúÊõãú İöíåö ãöä ÔóìúÁò İóÍõßúãõåõ Åöáóì Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allah). Therefore, whatever the Book and Sunnah decide and testify to the truth of, then it, is the plain truth. What is beyond truth, save falsehood This is why Allah said, u   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÊõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóÇáúíóæúãö ÇáÇøñÎöÑö</div><br>  (if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day.) meaning, refer the disputes and conflicts that arise between you to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger for judgment. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÊõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóÇáúíóæúãö ÇáÇøñÎöÑö</div><br>  (if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. ) indicates that those who do not refer to the Book and Sunnah for judgment in their disputes, are not believers in Allah or the Last Day. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÎóíúÑñ</div><br>  (That is better) meaning, referring to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger for judgment in various disputes is better,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÍúÓóäõ ÊóÃúæöíáÇğ</div><br>  (and more suitable for final determination.) meaning, "Has a better end and destination,'' as As-Suddi and several others have stated while Mujahid said, "Carries a better reward.''  </div></body></html>
