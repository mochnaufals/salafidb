Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr and others among the Salaf said that the good righteous deeds that last are the five daily prayers. `Ata' bin Abi Rabah and Sa`id bin Jubayr narrated from Ibn `Abbas, "The good righteous deeds that last are `Subhan Allah (glory be to Allah)', `Al-Hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah)', `La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship except Allah)', and `Allahu Akbar (Allah is Most Great).'" The Commander of the faithful, `Uthman bin `Affan was questioned, "Which are the good righteous deeds that last'' He replied, "They are: `La ilaha illallah, Subhan Allah, Al-Hamdu Lillah, Allahu Akbar and La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah hil-`Aliyil-`Azim (there is no strength and no power except with Allah the Exalted, the Almighty).''' This was recorded by Imam Ahmad. Imam Ahmad also recorded from a freed slave of the Messenger of Allah that he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóÎò ÈóÎò áöÎóãúÓò ãóÇ ÃóËúŞóáóåõäøó İöí ÇáúãöíÒóÇäö: áóÇ Åöáóåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ æóÇááåõ ÃóßúÈóÑõ¡ æóÓõÈúÍóÇäó Çááåö¡ æóÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááåö¡ æóÇáúæóáóÏõ ÇáÕøóÇáöÍõ íõÊóæóİøóì İóíóÍúÊóÓöÈõåõ æóÇáöÏõåõ æóŞóÇáó: ÈóÎò ÈóÎò áöÎóãúÓò ãóäú áóŞöíó Çááåó ãõÓúÊóíúŞöäğÇ Èöåöäøó ÏóÎóáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó: íõÄúãöäõ ÈöÇááåö æóÇáúíóæúãö ÇáúÂÎöÑö¡ æóÈöÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóÇáäøóÇÑö¡ æóÈöÇáúÈóÚúËö ÈóÚúÏó ÇáúãóæúÊö¡ æóÈöÇáúÍöÓóÇÈ»</div><br>  (Well done!

Whoever meets Allah believing in them, he will enter Paradise; if he believes in Allah, the Last Day, Paradise and Hell, resurrection after death, and the Reckoning).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÈóÜŞöíóÇÊõ ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÇÊõ</div><br>  (the good righteous deeds that last, ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "This is the celebration of the remembrance of Allah, saying `La ilaha illallah, Allahu Akbar, Subhan Allah, Al-Hamdu Lillah, Tabarak Allah, La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah, Astaghfirallah, Sallallahu `ala Rasul-Allah', and fasting, prayer, Hajj, Sadaqah (charity), freeing slaves, Jihad, maintaining ties of kinship, and all other good deeds. These are the righteous good deeds that last, which will remain in Paradise for those who do them for as long as heaven and earth remain.'' Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas: "They are good words.'' `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, "They are all righteous deeds.'' This was also the view chosen by Ibn Jarir, may Allah have mercy on him.  </div></body></html>
