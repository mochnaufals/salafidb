How bad is that for which they have sold their own selves, that they should disbelieve in that which Allah has revealed (the Qur'an), grudging that Allah should reveal of His grace unto whom He wills of His servants.

As-Suddi said that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÆúÓóãóÇ ÇÔúÊóÑóæúÇú Èöåö ÃóäİõÓóåõãú</div><br>  (How bad is that for which they have sold their own selves) means, "The Jews sold themselves.'' meaning, what is worse is what they chose for themselves by disbelieving in what Allah revealed to Muhammad instead of believing, aiding and supporting him. This behavior of theirs is the result of their injustice, envy and hatred,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä íõäóÒøöáõ Çááøóåõ ãöä İóÖúáöåö Úóáóì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö</div><br>  (grudging that Allah should reveal of His grace unto whom He wills of His servants).

Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah, "Allah became angry with them because they ignored some of the Tawrah and disbelieved in the Prophet that He sent to them.'' I (Ibn Kathir) say that the meaning of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóÇÁõæÇ</div><br>  (And they drew on themselves) is that they deserved and acquired multiplied anger. Also, Abu Al-`Aliyah said, "Allah became angry with them, because of their disbelief in the Injil and `Isa and He became angry with them again, because they disbelieved in Muhammad and the Qur'an.'' Similar was said by `Ikrimah and Qatadah. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÚóĞóÇÈñ ãøõåöíäñ</div><br>  (And for the disbelievers, there is disgracing torment). Since their disbelief was a result of their transgression and envy, which was caused by arrogance, they were punished with disgrace and humiliation in this world and the Hereafter. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÓúÊóßúÈöÑõæäó Úóäú ÚöÈóÇÏóÊöì ÓóíóÏúÎõáõæäó Ìóåóäøóãó ÏóÎöÑöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, those who scorn My worship (i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness) they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!'') (40:60) meaning, "Disgraced, degraded and humiliated.'' Imam Ahmad narrated that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father said that his grandfather said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÍúÔóÑõ ÇáúãõÊóßóÈøöÑõæäó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÃóãúËóÇáó ÇáĞøóÑøö İöí ÕõæóÑö ÇáäøóÇÓö¡ íóÚúáõæåõãú ßõáøõ ÔóíúÁò ãöäó ÇáÕøöÛóÇÑö ÍóÊøóì íóÏúÎõáõæÇ ÓöÌúäğÇ İöí Ìóåóäøóãó íõŞóÇáõ áóåõ.
