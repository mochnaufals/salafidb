This includes what Allah has alloted for the heirs, according to the degree of relation they have to the deceased, and their degree of dependency on him. Therefore, do not transgress or violate them. So Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõØöÚö Çááøóåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ</div><br>  (And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger,) regarding the inheritance, and does not add or decrease any of these fixed shares by use of tricks and plots. Rather, he gives each his appointed share as Allah commanded, ordained and decided,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÍõÏõæÏõ Çááøóåö æóãóä íõØöÚö Çááøóåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ íõÏúÎöáúåõ ÌóäøóÜÊò ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÇ ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÇ æóĞáößó ÇáúİóæúÒõ ÇáúÚóÙöíãõ - æóãóä íóÚúÕö Çááøóåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ æóíóÊóÚóÏøó ÍõÏõæÏóåõ íõÏúÎöáúåõ äóÇÑÇğ ÎóÜáöÏÇğ İöíåóÇ æóáóåõ ÚóĞóÇÈñ ãøõåöíäñ </div><br>  (Will be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and is the great success. And whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, and transgresses His (set) limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment.) This is because he changed what Allah has ordained and disputed with His judgment. Indeed, this is the behavior of those who do not agree with what Allah has decided and divided, and this is why Allah punishes them with humiliation in the eternal, painful torment. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that, the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáó áóíóÚúãóáõ ÈöÚóãóáö Ãóåúáö ÇáúÎóíúÑö ÓóÈúÚöíäó ÓóäóÉğ¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ÃóæúÕóì ÍóÇİó İöí æóÕöíøóÊöåö¡ İóíõÎúÊóãõ áóåõ ÈöÔóÑøö Úóãóáöåö¡ İóíóÏúÎõáõ ÇáäøóÇÑó¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáó áóíóÚúãóáõ ÈöÚóãóáö Ãóåúáö ÇáÔøóÑøö ÓóÈúÚöíäó ÓóäóÉğ¡ İóíóÚúÏöáõ İöí æóÕöíøóÊöåö İóíõÎúÊóãõ áóåõ ÈöÎóíúÑö Úóãóáöåö İóíóÏúÎõáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (A man might perform the actions of righteous people for seventy years, but when it is time to compile his will, he commits injustice. So his final work will be his worst, and he thus enters the Fire. A man might perform the deeds of evil people for seventy years, yet he is fair in his will. So his final work will be his best, and he thus enters Paradise.) Abu Hurayrah said, "Read, if you will,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÍõÏõæÏõ Çááøóåö</div><br>  (These are the limits (set by) Allah) until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóĞóÇÈñ ãøõåöíäñ</div><br>  (a disgraceful torment.).'' In the chapter on injustice in the will, Abu Dawud recorded in his Sunan that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáó áóíóÚúãóáõ Ãóæö ÇáúãóÑúÃóÉó ÈöØóÇÚóÉö Çááåö ÓöÊøöíäó ÓóäóÉğ¡ Ëõãøó íóÍúÖõÑõåõãóÇ ÇáúãóæúÊõ¡ İóíõÖóÇÑøóÇäö İöí ÇáúæóÕöíøóÜÉö¡ İóÊóÌöÈõ áóåõãóÇ ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (A man or a woman might perform actions in obedience to Allah for sixty years. Yet, when they are near death, they leave an unfair will and thus acquire the Fire.) Abu Hurayrah then recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ÈóÚúÏö æóÕöíøóÉò íõæÕóì ÈöåóÂ Ãóæú Ïóíúäò ÛóíúÑó ãõÖóÂÑøò</div><br>  (After payment of legacies he (or she) may have bequeathed or debts, so that no loss is caused), until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóĞáößó ÇáúİóæúÒõ ÇáúÚóÙöíãõ</div><br>  (and that is the great success.) This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, and At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Gharib''.  </div></body></html>
