Benefits of the Hereafter includes Allah's pleasure. Material benefits in this world include sacrificial animals and trade.'' This was also the view of Mujahid and others, that the benefits come in this world and in the Hereafter. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó Úóáóíúßõãú ÌõäóÇÍñ Ãóä ÊóÈúÊóÛõæÇú İóÖúáÇğ ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú</div><br>  (There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord) 2:198.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóĞúßõÑõæÇú ÇÓúãó Çááøóåö İöì ÃóíøóÇãò ãøóÚúáõæãóÜÊò Úóáóì ãóÇ ÑóÒóŞóåõãú ãøöä ÈóåöíãóÉö ÇáÇøñäúÚóÇãö</div><br>  (and mention the Name of Allah on appointed days, over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice).) Shu`bah and Hushaym narrated from Abu Bishr from Sa`id from Ibn `Abbas, "The appointed days are the ten days (of Dhul-Hijjah). Al-Bukhari narrated this with a disconnected chain in a manner denoting his approval of it. Something similar was narrated from Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, Mujahid, Qatadah, `Ata', Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Ibrahim An-Nakha`i. Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÇáúÚóãóáõ İöí ÃóíøóÇãò ÃóİúÖóáó ãöäúåóÇ İöí åóĞöå»</div><br>  (No deeds are more virtuous than deeds done on these days.) They said, "Not even Jihad for the sake of Allah'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóáóÇ ÇáúÌöåóÇÏõ İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö ÅöáøóÇ ÑóÌõáñ íóÎúÑõÌõ íõÎóÇØöÑõ ÈöäóİúÓöåö æóãóÇáöåö İóáóãú íóÑúÌöÚú ÈöÔóíúÁ»</div><br>  (Not even Jihad for the sake of Allah, unless a man goes out risking himself and his wealth for the sake of Allah, and does not come back with anything.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú ÃóíøóÇãò ÃóÚúÙóãó ÚöäúÏó Çááåö æóáóÇ ÃóÍóÈøõ Åöáóíúåö ÇáúÚóãóáõ İöíåöäøó ãöäú åóĞöåö ÇáúÃóíøóÇãö ÇáúÚóÔúÑö İóÃóßúËöÑõæÇ İöíåöäøó ãöäó ÇáÊøóåúáöíáö æóÇáÊøóßúÈöíÑö æóÇáÊøóÍúãöíÏ»</div><br>  (There are no days that are greater before Allah or in which deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so increase your Tahlil, Takbir, and Tahmid during these days.) Al-Bukhari said, "Ibn `Umar and Abu Hurayrah used to go out in the marketplace during the ten days and say Takbir, and the people would say Takbir when they said Takbir.'' These ten days include the day of `Arafah. It was recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Qatadah said, "The Messenger of Allah was asked about fasting on the day of `Arafah, and he said, R   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÍúÊóÓöÈõ Úóáóì Çááåö Ãóäú íõßóİøöÑó ÇáÓøóäóÉó ÇáúãóÇÖöíóÉó æóÇáúÂÊöíóÉ»</div><br>  (I hope by Allah that it will be an expiation for the previous year and the coming year. ) These ten days include the day of An-Nahr (Sacrifice), which is the greatest day of Hajj, and it was recorded in a Hadith that it is the most virtous day to Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóì ãóÇ ÑóÒóŞóåõãú ãøöä ÈóåöíãóÉö ÇáÇøñäúÚóÇãö</div><br>  (over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them.) means, camels, cattle and sheep, as Allah explained in Surat Al-An`am:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ËóãóÜäöíóÉó ÃóÒúæóÌò</div><br>  (eight pairs) 6:143   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßõáõæÇú ãöäúåóÇ æóÃóØúÚöãõæÇú ÇáúÈóÂÆöÓó ÇáúİóŞöíÑó</div><br>  (Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor having a hard time.) It was recorded that when the Messenger of Allah offered his sacrifice, he commanded that part of each animal should be taken and cooked, and he ate some of the meat and drank some of the broth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßõáõæÇú ãöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (Then eat thereof) Hushaym narrated from Husayn, from Mujahid, "This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÍóáóáúÊõãú İóÇÕúØóÜÏõæÇú</div><br>  (But when you finish the Ihram, you may hunt) 5:2   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ŞõÖöíóÊö ÇáÕøóáóæÉõ İóÇäÊóÔöÑõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Then when the (Jumu`ah) Salah (prayer) is ended, you may disperse through the land) 62:10.'' This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir in his Tafsir.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÈóÂÆöÓó ÇáúİóŞöíÑó</div><br>  (the poor having a hard time.) `Ikrimah said, "This means the one who is in desperate need whose poverty is apparent, and the poor person who is too proud to ask others for help.'' Mujahid said, "The one who does not stretch forth his hand (to ask for help).''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó áúíóŞúÖõæÇú ÊóİóËóåõãú</div><br>  (Then let them complete their prescribed duties) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "This means ending Ihram by shaving one's head, putting on one's ordinary clothes, trimming one's nails and so on.'' This was also reported from him by `Ata' and Mujahid. This was also the view of `Ikrimah and Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáúíõæİõæÇú äõĞõæÑóåõãú</div><br>  (and perform their vows,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, this means any vows made about sacrificing a camel.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáúíóØøóæøóİõæÇú ÈöÇáúÈóíúÊö ÇáúÚóÊöíŞö</div><br>  (and circumambulate the `Atiq House. ) Mujahid said, "This means the Tawaf which is obligatory on the day of Sacrifice.'' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hamzah said, "Ibn `Abbas said to me: `Have you read in Surat Al-Hajj where Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáúíóØøóæøóİõæÇú ÈöÇáúÈóíúÊö ÇáúÚóÊöíŞö</div><br>  (and circumambulate the `Atiq House.) The end of rituals is the Tawaf around the `Atiq House.''' I say, this is what the Messenger of Allah did. When he came back from Mina on the day of Sacrifice, he began with stoning the Jamrah, stoning it with seven pebbles, then he offered his sacrifice and shaved his head, then he departed and circumambulated the House.'' In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "The people were commanded to end their visit to the Ka`bah by circumambulating the House, but menstruating women are exempt from this.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÇáúÈóíúÊö ÇáúÚóÊöíŞö</div><br>  (the `Atiq House) the area from behind Al-Hijr, because this was originally part of the Ka`bah built by Ibrahim, but the Quraysh exculded it from the House (when they had to rebuild it) because they were short of funds. The Messenger of Allah included it in his Tawaf and said that it is part of the House. He did not acknowledge the two Shami corners, because they were not built precisely upon the original foundations of Ibrahim. Qatadah narrated that Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented on the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáúíóØøóæøóİõæÇú ÈöÇáúÈóíúÊö ÇáúÚóÊöíŞö</div><br>  (and circumambulate the `Atiq House.) "Because it is the first House established for mankind.'' This was also the view of `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. It was recorded that `Ikrimah said, "It was called Al-Bayt Al-`Atiq because it survived (U`tiqa) from the flood at the time of Nuh.'' Khusayf said, "It was called Al-Bayt Al-`Atiq because it was never conquered by any tyrant.''  </div></body></html>
