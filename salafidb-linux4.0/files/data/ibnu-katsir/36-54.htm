Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ åõã ãøöäó ÇáÇøñÌúÏóÇËö Åöáóì ÑóÈøöåöãú íóäÓöáõæäó</div><br>  (and behold from the graves they will come out quickly to their Lord.) Yansilun means they will be walking quickly. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÎúÑõÌõæäó ãöäó ÇáÇøñÌúÏóÇËö ÓöÑóÇÚÇğ ßóÃóäøóåõãú Åöáóì äõÕõÈò íõæİöÖõæäó </div><br>  (The Day when they will come out of the graves quickly as racing to a goal.) (70:43).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú íæóíúáóäóÇ ãóä ÈóÚóËóäóÇ ãöä ãøóÑúŞóÏöäóÇ</div><br>  (They will say: "Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our place of sleep.'') meaning, their graves, which in this world they thought they would never be raised from. When they see with their own eyes that in which they had disbelieved,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú íæóíúáóäóÇ ãóä ÈóÚóËóäóÇ ãöä ãøóÑúŞóÏöäóÇ</div><br>  (They will say: "Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our place of sleep.'') This does not contradict the fact that they will be punished in their graves, because in comparison to what is to come afterwards, that will seem like a nap. Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, "They will sleep before the Resurrection.'' Qatadah said, "That will be between the two trumpet blasts, they will say, `Who has raised us up from our place of sleep''' When they say that, the believers will respond. This was the view of more than one of the Salaf.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóĞóÇ ãóÇ æóÚóÏó ÇáÑøóÍúãÜäõ æóÕóÏóŞó ÇáúãõÑúÓóáõæäó</div><br>  ((It will be said to them): "This is what the Most Gracious had promised, and the Messengers spoke truth!'') Al-Hasan said, "The angels will reply to them in this manner. There is no contradiction because both are possible. And Allah knows best.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ßóÇäóÊú ÅöáÇøó ÕóíúÍóÉğ æóÍöÏóÉğ İóÅöĞóÇ åõãú ÌóãöíÚñ áøóÏóíúäóÇ ãõÍúÖóÑõæäó </div><br>  (It will be but a single Sayhah, so behold they will all be brought up before Us!)
