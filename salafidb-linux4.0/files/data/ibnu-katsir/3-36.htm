Muhammad bin Ishaq mentioned that Hannah could not have children and that one day, she saw a bird feeding its chick. She wished she could have children and supplicated to Allah to grant her offspring. Allah accepted her supplication, and when her husband slept with her, she became pregnant. She vowed to make her child concentrate on worship and serving Bayt Al-Maqdis (the Masjid in Jerusalem), when she became aware that she was pregnant. She said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö Åöäøöí äóĞóÑúÊõ áóßó ãóÇ İöí ÈóØúäöí ãõÍóÑøóÑğÇ İóÊóŞóÈøóáú ãöäøöí Åöäøóßó ÃóäÊó ÇáÓøóãöíÚõ ÇáúÚóáöíãõ</div><br>  (O my Lord! I have vowed to You what is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services, so accept this from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing.) meaning, You hear my supplication and You know my intention. She did not know then what she would give birth to, a male or a female.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ æóÖóÚóÊúåóÇ ŞóÇáóÊú ÑóÈøö Åöäøöì æóÖóÚúÊõåóÂ ÃõäËóì æóÇááøóåõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöãóÇ æóÖóÚóÊú</div><br>  (Then when she gave birth to her, she said: "O my Lord! I have given birth to a female child, Ü and Allah knew better what she bore.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóíúÓó ÇáĞøóßóÑõ ßóÇáÇøòäËóì</div><br>  (And the male is not like the female,) in strength and the commitment to worship Allah and serve the Masjid in Jerusalem.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøöì ÓóãøóíúÊõåóÇ ãóÑúíóãó</div><br>  (And I have named her Maryam,) thus, testifying to the fact that it is allowed to give a name to the newly born the day it is born, as is apparent from the Ayah, which is also a part of the law of those who were before us. Further, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah mentioned that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æõáöÏó áöíó ÇááøóíúáóÉó æóáóÏñ¡ ÓóãøóíúÊõåõ ÈöÇÓúãö ÃóÈöí ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíã»</div><br>  (This night, a son was born for me and I called him by my father's name, Ibrahim.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith.  They also recorded that Anas bin Malik brought his newborn brother to the Messenger of Allah who chewed a piece of date and put it in the child's mouth and called him `Abdullah. Other new born infants were also given names on the day they were born.  Qatadah narrated that Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, that Samurah bin Jundub said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáøõ ÛõáóÇãò Ñóåöíäñ ÈöÚóŞöíŞóÊöåö¡ íõĞúÈóÍõ Úóäúåõ íóæúãó ÓóÇÈöÚöåö¡ æóíõÓóãøóì æóíõÍúáóŞõ ÑóÃóÓõå»</div><br>  (Every new born boy held in security by his `Aqiqah, until his seventh day, a sacrifice is offered on his behalf, he is given a name, and the hair on his head is shaved.)  This Hadith was collected by Ahmad and the collectors of the Sunan, and was graded Sahih by At-Tirmidhi. We should mention that another narration for this Hadith contained the wording, "and blood is offered on his behalf,'' which is more famous and established than the former narration, and Allah knows best.  Allah's statement that Maryam's mother said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æöÅöäøöì ÃõÚöíĞõåóÇ Èößó æóĞõÑøöíøóÊóåóÇ ãöäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö ÇáÑøóÌöíãö</div><br>  ("...And I seek refuge with You for her and for her offspring from Shaytan, the outcast.'') means, that she sought refuge with Allah from the evil of Shaytan, for her and her offspring, i.e., `Isa, peace be upon him. Allah accepted her supplication, for `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú ãóæúáõæÏò íõæáóÏõ ÅöáøóÇ ãóÓøóåõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäõ Íöíäó íõæáóÏõ¡ İóíóÓúÊóåöáøõ ÕóÇÑöÎğÇ ãöäú ãóÓøöåö ÅöíøóÇåõ¡ ÅöáøóÇ ãóÑúíóãó æóÇÈúäóåóÇ»</div><br>  (Every newly born baby is touched by Shaytan when it is born, and the baby starts crying because of this touch, except Maryam and her son.)  Abu Hurayrah then said, "Read if you will,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æöÅöäøöì ÃõÚöíĞõåóÇ Èößó æóĞõÑøöíøóÊóåóÇ ãöäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö ÇáÑøóÌöíãö</div><br>  (And I seek refuge with You for her and for her offspring from Shaytan, the outcast).'' The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith.  </div></body></html>
