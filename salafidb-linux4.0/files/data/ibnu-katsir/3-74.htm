They decided that they would pretend to be believers in the beginning of the day, by attending the dawn prayer with the Muslims. However, when the day ended, they would revert to their old religion so that the ignorant people would say, "They reverted to their old religion because they uncovered some shortcomings in the Islamic religion.'' This is why they said next.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóåõãú íóÑúÌöÚõæäó</div><br>  (so that they may turn back.) Ibn Abi Najih said that Mujahid commented about this Ayah, which refers to the Jews, "They attended the dawn prayer with the Prophet and disbelieved in the end of the day in order to misguide the people. This way, people would think that they have uncovered shortcomings in the religion that they briefly followed.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊõÄúãöäõæÇú ÅöáÇøó áöãóä ÊóÈöÚó Ïöíäóßõãú</div><br>  ("And believe no one except the one who follows your religion.'')  They said, do not trust anyone with your secret knowledge, except those who follow your religion. Therefore, they say, do not expose your knowledge to Muslims in order to prevent them from believing in it and, thus, use it as proof against you. Allah replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Åöäøó ÇáúåõÏóì åõÏóì Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Say: (O Prophet) "Verily, right guidance is the guidance of Allah.'')  Allah guides the hearts of the faithful to the perfect faith through the clear Ayat, plain proofs and unequivocal evidence that He has sent down to His servant and Messenger Muhammad . This occurs, O you Jews, even though you hide the description of Muhammad . the unlettered Prophet whom you find in your Books that you received from the earlier Prophets.

They say, "Do not disclose the knowledge that you have to the Muslims, to prevent them from learning it and thus becoming your equals. They will be even better because they will believe in it or will use it against you as evidence with your Lord, and thus establish Allah's proof against you in this life and the Hereafter.''

Verily, Allah gives faith, knowledge and sound comprehension to whomever He wills. He also misguides whomever He wills by blinding his sight, mind, sealing his heart, hearing and stamping his eyes closed. Allah has the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proofs.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ æóÓöÚñ ÚóáöíãñíóÎúÊóÕøõ ÈöÑóÍúãóÊöåö ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ æóÇááøóåõ Ğõæ ÇáúİóÖúáö ÇáúÚóÙöíãö </div><br>  (And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower.''
