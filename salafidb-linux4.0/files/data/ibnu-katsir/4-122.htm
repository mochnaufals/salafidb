Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõÔúÑößú ÈöÇááøóåö İóŞóÏú Öóáøó ÖóáóÜáÇğ ÈóÚöíÏÇğ</div><br>  (and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away.) means, he will have taken other than the true path, deviated from guidance and righteousness, destroyed himself in this life and the Hereafter, and lost contentment in this life and the Hereafter. Juwaybir said that Ad-Dahhak said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä íóÏúÚõæäó ãöä Ïõæäöåö ÅöáÇøó ÅöäóÜËÇğ</div><br>  (They invoke nothing but female deities besides Him (Allah),) "The idolators claimed that the angels are Allah's daughters, saying, `We only worship them so that they bring us closer to Allah.' So they took the angels as gods, made the shapes of girls and decided, `These (idols) resemble the daughters of Allah (i.e., the angels), Whom we worship. ''' This is similar to Allah's statements,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÑóÁóíúÊõãõ ÇááøóÜÊó æóÇáúÚõÒøóì </div><br>  (Have you then considered Al-Lat and Al-`Uzza)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáõæÇú ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉó ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú ÚöÈóÇÏõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÅöäóÜËÇğ</div><br>  (And they make the angels who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious (Allah) females) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáõæÇú Èóíúäóåõ æóÈóíúäó ÇáúÌöäøóÉö äóÓóÈÇğ</div><br>  (And they have invented a kinship between Him and the Jinn).

Consequently, they are worshipping Shaytan in reality, just as Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÃóÚúåóÏú Åöáóíúßõãú íÈóäöì ÁóÇÏóãó Ãóä áÇøó ÊóÚúÈõÏõæÇú ÇáÔøóíØóÜäó</div><br>  (Did I not command you, O Children of Adam, that you should not worship Shaytan) Allah said that, on the Day of Resurrection, the angels shall proclaim about the idolators who worshipped them in this life:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúÈõÏõæäó ÇáúÌöäøó ÃóßúÜËóÑõåõã Èöåöã ãøõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (Nay, but they used to worship the Jinn; most of them were believers in them).  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóÚóäóåõ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (Allah cursed him), means, He expelled him and banished him from His mercy and His grace.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøÊøóÎöĞóäøó ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏößó äóÕöíÈÇğ ãøóİúÑõæÖÇğ</div><br>  (I will take an appointed portion of your servants) means, a fixed and known share. Muqatil bin Hayyan commented, "From every one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine will go to the Fire and one to Paradise.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÃÖöáøóäøóåõãú</div><br>  (Verily, I will mislead them) from the true path,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÃõãóäøöíóäøóåõãú</div><br>  (and surely, I will arouse in them false desires;) tempting them to feign repentance, arousing false hopes in them, encouraging them to delay and procrastinate with righteous deeds, deceiving them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇøãõÑóäøóåõãú İóáóíõÈóÊøößõäøó ÁóÇĞóÇäó ÇáÇøñäúÚóÜãö</div><br>  (and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle,) meaning, slitting their ears to designate them as Bahirah, Sa'ibah, and a Wasilah, as Qatadah and As-Suddi stated.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇøãõÑóäøóåõãú İóáóíõÛóíøöÑõäøó ÎóáúŞó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah.) means tattooing, according to Al-Hasan bin Abi Al-Hasan Al-Basri. In his Sahih, Muslim recorded the prohibition of tattooing the face, which in one of its wordings states: "May Allah curse whoever does this.'' It is also recorded in the Sahih that Ibn Mas`ud said, "May Allah curse those who have tattoos and those who do it, who pluck their (facial) hairs and the one who does it for them, and those who make spaces between their teeth for the purpose of beauty, changing what Allah has created.'' He then said, "Why should not I curse whom the Messenger of Allah has cursed, when the Book of Allah commands it,'' referring to the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÁóÇÊóÜßõãõ ÇáÑøóÓõæáõ İóÎõĞõæåõ æóãóÇ äóåóÜßõãú Úóäúåõ İóÇäÊóåõæÇú</div><br>  (And whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)).

Indeed, this is a type of loss that cannot be compensated or restored. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚöÏõåõãú æóíõãóäøöíåöãú æóãóÇ íóÚöÏõåõãú ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ ÅöáÇøó ÛõÑõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (He Shaytan makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires;) explains the true reality. Surely, Shaytan deceitfully promises his supporters and tempts them into believing that they are winners in this and the Hereafter. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÚöÏõåõãú ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ ÅöáÇøó ÛõÑõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (and Shaytan's promises are nothing but deceptions.)

I had no authority over you), until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó áóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, there is a painful torment for the wrongdoers.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó</div><br>  (of such (people)) refers to those who like and prefer what Shaytan is promising and assuring them of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÃúæóÇåõãú Ìóåóäøóãõ</div><br>  (The dwelling of such (people) is Hell), as their destination and abode on the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÌöÏõæäó ÚóäúåóÇ ãóÍöíÕÇğ</div><br>  (and they will find no way of escape from it.), meaning, they will not be able to avoid, avert, evade or elude the Hellfire. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reward of Righteous Believers</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then mentions the condition of the content righteous believers and the perfect honor they will earn in the end.
