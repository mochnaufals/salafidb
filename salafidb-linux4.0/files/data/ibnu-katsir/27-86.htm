This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÍúÔõÑõæÇú ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú æóÃóÒúæóÌóåõãú</div><br>  ("Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions (from the devils).'')

Since they are among the doomed and, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÕóÏøóŞó æóáÇó Õóáøóì - æóáóÜßöä ßóĞøóÈó æóÊóæóáøóì </div><br>  (He neither believed nor performed Salah! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!) (75:31-32) Then the proof will be established against them and they will have no excuse whatsoever, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ íóæúãõ áÇó íóäØöŞõæäó - æóáÇó íõÄúĞóäõ áóåõãú İóíóÚúÊóĞöÑõæäó </div><br>  (That will be a Day when they shall not speak. And they will not be permitted to put forth any excuse) (77:35-36). Similarly, Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóŞóÚó ÇáúŞóæúáõ Úóáóíúåöã ÈöãóÇ ÙóáóãõæÇú İóåõãú áÇó íóäØöŞõæäó </div><br>  (And the Word will be fulfilled against them, because they have done wrong, and they will be unable to speak.) They will be stunned and speechless, unable to give any answer. This is because they wronged themselves in the world, and now they have returned to the One Who sees the unseen and the seen, from Whom nothing can be hidden. Then Allah points out His complete power, immense authority and greatness, all dictating that He is to be obeyed and that His commands must be followed, and that the message of inescapable truth brought by His Prophets must be believed in. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú íóÑóæúÇú ÃóäøóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ Çáøóíúáó áöíóÓúßõäõæÇú İöíåö</div><br>  (See they not that We have made the night for them to rest therein,) Due to the darkness of the night they halt their activities and calm themselves down, to recover from the exhausting efforts of the day.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáäøóåóÜÇÑó ãõÈúÕöÜÑÇğ</div><br>  (and the day sight-giving) meaning filled with light, so that they can work and earn a living, and travel and engage in business, and do other things that they need to do.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğáößó áÂíóÜÊò áøöŞóæúãò íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, in this are Ayat for the people who believe.)  </div></body></html>
