For instance, Allah the Exalted punished the people of Nuh by drowning them in the encompassing flood that touched all the people of earth. There is also the end that struck the people of Ar-Rass, and we mentioned their story before in Surat Al-Furqan,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóËóãõæÏõæóÚóÇÏñ æóİöÑúÚóæúäõ æóÅöÎúæóäõ áõæØò </div><br>  (...and Thamud, and `Ad, and Fir`awn, and the brethren of Lut,) the people of Sadum (Sodom) and the surrounding areas, to whom Lut was sent. Allah the Exalted shook the earth beneath them and turned their area into a reeking lake, as stinking as the disbelief, tyranny and defiance of the Truth that they had,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáÇøñíúßóÉö</div><br>  (And the Dwellers of Al-Aykah), they are the nation of Shu`ayb, peace be upon him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóæúãõ ÊøõÈøóÚò</div><br>  (and the people of Tubba`), King of Yemen; we explained his story in the Tafsir of Surat Ad-Dukhan, and therefore, we do not need to repeat it here. All praise is due to Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøñ ßóĞøóÈó ÇáÑøõÓõáó</div><br>  (Everyone of them denied (their) Messengers,) means, all of these nations and their generations belied their respective Messenger, and whoever denies even one Messenger, is as if he has denied all Messengers. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞøóÈóÊú Şóæúãõ äõæÍò ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíäó </div><br>  (The people of Nuh denied the Messengers.)(26:105) even though only one Messenger was sent to them, and indeed, if all the Messengers were sent to them, they would have disbelieved in them as well. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÍóŞøó æóÚöíÏö</div><br>  (so My threat took effect.) meaning, the promise of torment and punishment that Allah delivered to them on account of their denial took effect. Therefore, all those who fear suffering the same end should be warned, especially since the latter have denied their Messenger, just as the former denied their Messenger. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Repeating the Creation is Easier than originating It</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÚóíöíäóÇ ÈöÇáúÎóáúŞö ÇáÇøñæøóáö</div><br>  (Were We then tired with the first creation) meaning, `did starting the creation bring fatigue to Us, so as to cause doubt in them that repeating the creation was not possible'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú åõãú İöì áóÈúÓò ãøöäú ÎóáúŞò ÌóÏöíÏò</div><br>  (Nay, they are in confused doubt about a new creation.) meaning, `starting the creation did not tire Us, and repeating it is even easier.'
