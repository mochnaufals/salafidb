This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóãúÔö İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ãóÑóÍğÇ</div><br>  (And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance...) (17:37). So these people do not walk with conceit or arrogance or pride. This does not mean that they should walk like sick people, making a show of their humility, for the leader of the sons of Adam (the Prophet) used to walk as if he was coming downhill, and as if the earth were folded up beneath him. What is meant here by Hawn is serenity and dignity, as the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÊóíúÊõãõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó İóáóÇ ÊóÃúÊõæåóÇ æóÃóäúÊõãú ÊóÓúÚóæäó¡ æóÃúÊõæåóÇ æóÚóáóíúßõãõ ÇáÓøóßöíäóÉõ İóãóÇ ÃóÏúÑóßúÊõãú ãöäúåóÇ İóÕóáøõæÇ¡ æóãóÇ İóÇÊóßõãú İóÃóÊöãøõæÇ»</div><br>  (When you come to the prayer, do not come rushing in haste. Come calmly and with tranquility, and whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, make it up.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÎóÇØóÈóåõãõ ÇáÌóÜåöáõæäó ŞóÇáõæÇú ÓóáÇóãÇğ</div><br>  (and when the foolish address them they say: "Salama.'') If the ignorant people insult them with bad words, they do not respond in kind, but they forgive and overlook, and say nothing but good words. This is what the Messenger of Allah did: the more ignorant the people, the more patient he would be. This is as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÓóãöÚõæÇú ÇááøóÛúæó ÃóÚúÑóÖõæÇú Úóäúåõ</div><br>  (And when they hear Al-Laghw (evil or vain talk), they withdraw from it) (28:55). Then Allah says that their nights are the best of nights, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó íöÈöíÊõæäó áöÑóÈøöåöãú ÓõÌøóÏÇğ æóŞöíóÜãÇğ </div><br>  (And those who spend the night in worship of their Lord, prostrate and standing.) meaning, worshipping and obeying Him. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇäõæÇú ŞóáöíáÇğ ãøöä Çáøóíúáö ãóÇ íóåúÌóÚõæäó - æóÈöÇáÇøñÓúÍóÜÑö åõãú íóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõæäó </div><br>  (They used to sleep but little by night. And in the hours before dawn, they were asking for forgiveness) (51:17-18).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÊóÌóÇİóì ÌõäõæÈõåõãú Úóäö ÇáúãóÖóÇÌöÚö</div><br>  (Their sides forsake their beds...) (32:16).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãøóäú åõæó ŞóÇäöÊñ ÁóÇäóÂÁó Çáøóíúáö ÓóÜÌöÏÇğ æóŞóÂÆöãÇğ íóÍúĞóÑõ ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉó æóíóÑúÌõæÇú ÑóÍúãóÉó ÑóÈøöåö</div><br>  (Is one who is obedient to Allah, prostrating himself or standing during the hours of the night, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord...) (39:9). Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó íóŞõæáõæäó ÑóÈøóäóÇ ÇÕúÑöİú ÚóäøóÇ ÚóĞóÇÈó Ìóåóäøóãó Åöäøó ÚóĞóÇÈóåóÇ ßóÇäó ÛóÑóÇãÇğ </div><br>  (And those who say: "Our Lord! Avert from us the torment of Hell. Verily, its torment is ever an inseparable punishment.'') meaning, ever-present and never ending. Al-Hasan said concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÚóĞóÇÈóåóÇ ßóÇäó ÛóÑóÇãÇğ</div><br>  (Verily, its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment.) Everything that strikes the son of Adam, then disappears, does not constitute an inseparable, permanent punishment. The inseparable, permanent punishment is that which lasts as long as heaven and earth. This was also the view of Sulayman At-Taymi.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóåóÇ ÓóÂÁóÊú ãõÓúÊóŞóÑøÇğ æóãõŞóÇãÇğ </div><br>  (Evil indeed it is as an abode and as a place to rest in.) means, how evil it looks as a place to dwell and how evil it is as a place to rest.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÂ ÃóäİóŞõæÇú áóãú íõÓúÑöİõæÇú æóáóãú íóŞúÊõÑõæÇú</div><br>  (And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy...) They are not extravagant, spending more than they need, nor are they miserly towards their families, not spending enough on their needs. But they follow the best and fairest way. The best of matters are those which are moderate, neither one extreme nor the other.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó Èóíúäó Ğóáößó ŞóæóÇãÇğ</div><br>  (but are in a just balance between them.) This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÌúÚóáú íóÏóßó ãóÛúáõæáóÉğ Åöáóì ÚõäõŞößó æóáÇó ÊóÈúÓõØúåóÇ ßõáøó ÇáúÈóÓúØö</div><br>  (And let not your hand be tied to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach.)(17:29)  </div></body></html>
