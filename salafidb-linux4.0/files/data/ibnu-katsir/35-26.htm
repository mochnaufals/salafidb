Darkness and light are not equal, neither are shade and the sun's heat. By the same token, the living and the dead are not equal. This is the parable Allah makes of the believers who are the living, and the disbelievers who are the dead. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæóãóä ßóÇäó ãóíúÊğÇ İóÃóÍúíóíúäóÜåõ æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ áóåõ äõæÑğÇ íóãúÔöí Èöåö İöì ÇáäøóÇÓö ßóãóä ãøóËóáõåõ İöí ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö áóíúÓó ÈöÎóÇÑöÌò ãøöäúåóÇ ßóĞóáößó</div><br>  (Is he who was dead and We gave him life and set for him a light (of belief) whereby he can walk amongst men -- like him who is in the (depths of) darkness from which he can never come out) (6:122),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóËóáõ ÇáúİóÑöíŞóíúäö ßóÇáÇøñÚúãóì æóÇáÇøñÕóãøö æóÇáúÈóÕöíÑö æóÇáÓøóãöíÚö åóáú íóÓúÊóæöíóÇäö ãóËóáÇğ</div><br>  (The parable of the two parties is as that of the blind and the deaf and the seer and the hearer. Are they equal when compared) (11:24) The believer sees and hears, and walks in the light upon a straight path in this world and the Hereafter, until he comes to settle in Gardens (Paradise) wherein is shade and springs. The disbeliever is blind and deaf, walking in darkness from which he cannot escape, he is lost in his misguidance in this world and the Hereafter, until he ends up in fierce hot wind and boiling water, and shadow of black smoke, neither cool nor good.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íõÓúãöÚõ ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah makes whom He wills to hear,) means.
