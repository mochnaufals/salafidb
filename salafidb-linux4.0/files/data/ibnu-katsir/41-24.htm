He will say, "My Lord, did You not promise me that you would not treat me unjustly'' Allah will say, "Yes.'' The man will say, "I will not accept any witness against me except from myself.'' Allah will say, "Is it not sufficient that I and the angels, the noble scribes, are witnesses'' These words will be repeated several times, then a seal will be placed over his mouth and his organs (or limbs) will speak about what he used to do. Then he will say, "Away with you! It was only for your sake that I was arguing!'')'' It was recorded by him and Ibn Abi Hatim. It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Burdah said that Abu Musa said, "The disbeliever or the hypocrite will be called to account and his Lord will show him his deeds, but he will deny them and say, `O Lord, by Your glory, this angel has written about me something that I did not do.' The angel will say to him, `Did you not do such and such on such and such a day in such and such a place' He will say, `No, by Your glory O Lord, I did not do it.' When he does that, a seal will be placed over his mouth.'' Al-Ash`ari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "I think that the first part of his body to speak will be his right thigh.''

Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "I was hiding beneath the covering of the Ka`bah, and three men came along -- a man from the Quraysh and two of his brothers-in-law from Thaqif, or a man from Thaqif and two of his brothers-in-law from the Quraysh. Their bellies were very fat, and did not have much understanding. They said some words I could not hear, then one of them said, `Do you think that Allah can hear what we are saying now' The other said, `If we raise our voices, He will hear it, but if we do not raise our voices, He will not hear it.' The other said, `If He can hear one thing from us, He can hear everything.' I mentioned this to the Prophet , then Allah revealed the words:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÓúÊóÊöÑõæäó Ãóä íóÔúåóÏó Úóáóíúßõãú ÓóãúÚõßõãú æóáÇó ÃóÈúÕóÜÑõßõãú æóáÇó ÌõáõæÏõßõãú</div><br>  (And you have not been hiding yourselves (in the world), lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you) until;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöäó ÇáúÎóÜÓöÑöíäó</div><br>  (of those utterly lost!) This is how it was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. A similar report was also narrated by Ahmad (through a different chain), Muslim and At-Tirmidhi, and Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded (a different chain).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä íóÕúÈöÑõæÇú İóÇáäøóÇÑõ ãóËúæğì áøóåõãú æóÅöä íóÓúÊóÚúÊöÈõæÇú İóãóÇ åõã ãøöäó ÇáúãõÚúÊóÈöíäó </div><br>  (Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please Allah, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please Allah.) means, whether they bear it patiently or not, they are in the Fire and they will have no escape or way out from it, and even if they try to please Allah and offer excuses, nothing of that will be accepted from them. Ibn Jarir said, "The meaning of the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä íóÓúÊóÚúÊöÈõæÇú</div><br>  (and if they seek to please Allah,) is: They will ask to go back to this world, but this plea will not be answered.
