There are the angels, Jinns, humans, animals, birds, beasts, carnivores, insects and various kinds of sea creatures. The night and day alternate, each follows the other in succession, never ceasing to come, as decreed. One brings darkness and one brings light. Allah the Exalted also sends down the rain from the clouds when it is most needed. He is calling the rain, `provision', because it is the resource that produces various provisions,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÍúíóÇ Èöåö ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ÈóÚúÏó ãóæúÊöåóÇ</div><br>  (and revives therewith the earth after its death,) after it was dry and had no vegetation or life of any kind. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÕúÑöíİö ÇáÑøöíóÜÍö</div><br>  (and in the turning about of the winds,) sometimes towards the south and sometimes towards the north. Some are easterly winds and some are westerly winds, some bringing sea breezes and some blow from the land, some coming at night and some by day. Some winds bring rain, some cause pollination and some winds just revive the soul, while some others bear no benefit. Allah said first.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøíóÜÊò áøöáúãõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  (are signs for the believers), then   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõæŞöäõæäó</div><br>  (who have faith with certainty), then   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (who understand), thus ascending from one honorable stage to what is more honorable and higher in grade. These Ayat are similar to an Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöí ÎóáúŞö ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÇÎúÊöáóÜİö Çááøóíúáö æóÇáäøóåóÇÑö æóÇáúİõáúßö ÇáøóÊöì ÊóÌúÑöì İöì ÇáúÈóÍúÑö ÈöãóÇ íóäİóÚõ ÇáäøóÇÓó æóãóÂ ÃóäÒóáó Çááøóåõ ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ãöä ãøóÂÁò İóÃóÍúíóÇ Èöåö ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ÈóÚúÏó ãóæúÊöåóÇ æóÈóËøó İöíåóÇ ãöä ßõáøö ÏóÂÈøóÉò æóÊóÕúÑöíİö ÇáÑøöíóÜÍö æóÇáÓøóÍóÇÈö ÇáúãõÓóÎøóÑö Èóíúäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö æóÇáÃóÑúÖö áÂíóÜÊò áøöŞóæúãò íóÚúŞöáõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water which Allah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving creatures of all kinds that He has spread therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed signs for people of understanding.)
