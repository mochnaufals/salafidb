He will say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ ãóÇ áóÏóìøó ÚóÊöíÏñ</div><br>  ("Here is (his record) ready with me!''), here it is prepared and completed without addition or deletion.

It appears that Allah will say these words to the Sa'iq and Shahid angels; the Sa'iq drove him to the grounds where Reckoning is held and the Shahid testified. Allah the Exalted will order them to throw him in the fire of Jahannam, and worse it is as a destination,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáúŞöíóÇ İöì Ìóåóäøóãó ßõáøó ßóİøóÇÑò ÚóäöíÏò </div><br>  (Both of you throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever.) meaning, whose disbelief and denial of truth was horrendous, who used to stubbornly reject the truth, knowingly contradicting it with falsehood,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóäøóÜÚò áøöáúÎóíúÑö</div><br>  (Hinderer of good,) meaning for he did not fulfill the duties he was ordered, nor was he dutiful, keeping ties to kith and kin nor giving charity,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÚúÊóÏò</div><br>  (transgressor,) meaning, he transgresses the limits in spending. Qatadah commented, "He is a transgressor in his speech, behavior and affairs.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÑöíÈò</div><br>  (doubter,) meaning, he doubts and raises doubts in those who scrutinize his behavior,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóáó ãóÚó Çááøóåö ÅöáóÜåÇğ ÁóÇÎóÑó</div><br>  (who set up another god with Allah.) meaning, he associated others with Allah and worshipped others besides Him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóáúŞöíóÜåõ İöì ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö ÇáÔøóÏöíÏö</div><br>  (Then both of you cast him in the severe torment.)
