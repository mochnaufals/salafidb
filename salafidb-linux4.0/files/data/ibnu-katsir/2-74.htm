He was asked, `Who killed you' He said, `My nephews killed me.' He then died again. His nephews said, after Allah took his life away, `By Allah!

''  And by the passage of time, the hearts of the Children of Israel were unlikely to accept any admonishment, even after the miracles and signs they withnessed. Their hearts became harder than stones, with no hope of ever softening. Sometimes, springs and rivers burst out of stones, some stones split and water comes out of them, even if there are no springs or rivers around them, sometimes stones fall down from mountaintops out of their fear of Allah. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ãöäó ÇáúÍöÌóÇÑóÉö áóãóÇ íóÊóİóÌøóÑõ ãöäúåõ ÇáÃóäúåóÜÑõ æóÅöäøó ãöäúåóÇ áóãóÇ íóÔøóŞøóŞõ İóíóÎúÑõÌõ ãöäúåõ ÇáúãóÂÁõ æóÅöäøó ãöäúåóÇ áóãóÇ íóåúÈöØõ ãöäú ÎóÔúíóÉö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which split asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which fall down for fear of Allah), means, "Some stones are softer than your hearts, they acknowledge the truth that you are being called to,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ Çááøóåõ ÈöÛóÜİöáò ÚóãøóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (And Allah is not unaware of what you do).'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Solid Inanimate Objects possess a certain Degree of Awareness</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Some claimed that the Ayat mentioned the stones being humble as a metaphor. However, Ar-Razi, Al-Qurtubi and other Imams said that there is no need for this explanation, because Allah creates this characteristic - humbleness - in stones. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÚóÑóÖúäóÇ ÇáÇøñãóÇäóÉó Úóáóì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÇáúÌöÈóÇáö İóÃÈóíúäó Ãóä íóÍúãöáúäóåóÇ æóÃóÔúİóŞúäó ãöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (Truly, We did offer Al-Amanah (the trust) to the heavens and the earth, and the mountains, but they declined to bear it and were afraid of it (i.e. afraid of Allah's torment)) (33:72),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõÓóÈøöÍõ áóåõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊõ ÇáÓøóÈúÚõ æóÇáÇøñÑúÖõ æóãóä İöíåöäøó</div><br>  (The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him) (17:44),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáäøóÌúãõ æóÇáÔøóÌóÑõ íóÓúÌõÏóÇäö </div><br>  (And the stars and the trees both prostrate themselves (to Allah)) (55:6),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæó áóãúíóÑóæúÇú ÅöáóìÎóáóŞó Çááøóåõ ãöä ÔóìúÁò íóÊóİóíøóÃõ</div><br>  (Have they not observed things that Allah has created: (how) their shadows incline) (16:48),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáóÊóÂ ÃóÊóíúäóÇ ØóÂÆöÚöíäó</div><br>  (They both said: "We come willingly.'')

(41:21).  It is recorded in the Sahih that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åĞóÇ ÌóÈóáñ íõÍöÈøõäóÇ æóäõÍöÈøõå»</div><br>  (This (Mount Uhud) is a mount that loves us and that we love.)  Similarly, the compassion of the stump of the palm tree for the Prophet as confirmed in authentic narrations. In Sahih Muslim it is recorded that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí áóÃóÚúÑöİõ ÍóÌóÑğÇ ÈöãóßøóÉó ßóÇäó íõÓóáøöãõ Úóáóíøó ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú ÃõÈúÚóËó Åöäøöí áóÃóÚúÑöİõåõ ÇáúÂä»</div><br>  (I know a stone in Makkah that used to greet me with the Salam before I was sent. I recognize this stone now.)  He said about the Black Stone that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóåõ íóÔúåóÏõ áöãóäö ÇÓúÊóáóãó ÈöÍóŞó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (On the Day of Resurrection it will testifiy for those who kiss it.)  There are several other texts with this meaning. The scholars of the Arabic language disagreed over the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåöìó ßóÇáúÍöÌóÇÑóÉö Ãóæú ÃóÔóÏøõ ŞóÓúæóÉğ</div><br>  (And became as stones or even worse in hardness) after agreeing that `or' here is not being used to reflect doubt. Some scholars said that `or' here means, `and'. So the meaning becomes, "As hard as stones, and harder.'' For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊõØöÚú ãöäúåõãú ÁóÇËöãÇğ Ãóæú ßóİõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (And obey not a sinner or a disbeliever among them) (76:24), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚõĞúÑÇğ Ãóæú äõĞúÑÇğ </div><br>  (To cut off all excuses or to warn) (77:6).  Some other scholars said that `or' here means, `rather'. Hence, the meaning becomes, `As hard as stones. Rather, harder.' For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ İóÑöíŞñ ãøöäúåõãú íóÎúÔóæúäó ÇáäøóÇÓó ßóÎóÔúíóÉö Çááøóåö Ãóæú ÃóÔóÏøó ÎóÔúíóÉğ</div><br>  (A section of them fear men as they fear Allah or even more) (4:77),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÑúÓóáúäóÜåõ Åöáóì ãöÇúÆóÉö Ãóáúİò Ãóæú íóÒöíÏõæäó </div><br>  (And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more) (37:147), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóÇäó ŞóÇÈó ŞóæúÓóíúäö Ãóæú ÃóÏúäóì </div><br>  (And was at a distance of two bows' length or (even) nearer) (53:9).  Some other scholars said that this Ayah means their hearts are only of two types, as hard as stone or harder than stone. Further, Ibn Jarir commented that this Tafsir means that some of their hearts are as hard as stone and some hearts are harder than stone. Ibn Jarir said that he favored this last Tafsir, although the others are plausible. I - Ibn Kathir - say that the last Tafsir is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóËóáõåõãú ßóãóËóáö ÇáøóĞöì ÇÓúÊóæúŞóÏó äóÇÑÇğ</div><br>  (Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire) (2:17), and then His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ßóÕóíøöÈò ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö</div><br>  (Or like a rainstorm from the sky) (2:19).  It is also similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÃóÚúãóÜáõåõãú ßóÓóÑóÇÈò ÈöŞöíÚóÉò</div><br>  (As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert) (24:39), and then His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ßóÙõáõãóÜÊò İöì ÈóÍúÑò áøõÌøöìøò</div><br>  (Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea) (24:40).  This then means that some of them are like the first example, and some others are like the second example. Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
