Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑó Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó ßóíúİó ãóÏøó ÇáÙøöáøó</div><br>  (Have you not seen how your Lord spread the shadow.) Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, Masruq, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others said, "This refers to the period from the beginning of the dawn until the sun rises.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó áóÌóÚóáóåõ ÓóÇßöäÇğ</div><br>  (If He willed, He could have made it still) meaning, immobile, never changing. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóÑóÃóíúÊõãú Åöä ÌóÚóáó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúßõãõ Çáøóíúáó ÓóÑúãóÏÇğ</div><br>  (Say : "Tell me! If Allah made the night continuous for you...'') (28:71)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÌóÚóáúäóÇ ÇáÔøóãúÓó Úóáóíúåö ÏóáöíáÇğ</div><br>  (but We have made the sun its guide.) means, were it not for the sun rising, it would not be there, for a thing can only be known in contrast to its opposite. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, "The sun is a guide which follows the shade until the shade disappears. ''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ŞóÈóÖúäóÜåõ ÅöáóíúäóÇ ŞóÈúÖÇğ íóÓöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (Then We withdraw it towards Ourselves -- a gradual withdrawal.) This refers to the shade.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (gradual) meaning slowly. As-Suddi said: "A gentle, concealed, withdrawal until there is no shade left on earth except under a roof or a tree, and the sun is shining on whatever is above it.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÈúÖÇğ íóÓöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (a gradual withdrawal.) Ayyub bin Musa said: "Little by little.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóáó áóßõãõ Çáøóíúáó áöÈóÇÓÇğ</div><br>  (And it is He Who makes the night a covering for you,) It covers and conceals all things. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóíúáö ÅöĞóÇ íóÛúÔóì </div><br>  (By the night as it envelops) (92:1).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáäøóæúãó ÓõÈóÇÊÇğ</div><br>  (and the sleep a repose,) means, a halt to movement so that bodies may rest. For the faculties and limbs get tired from their constant movement during the day when one goes out to earn a living. When night comes, and it becomes quiet, they stop moving, and rest; so sleep provides a rejuvenation for both the body and the soul.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáó ÇáäøóåóÇÑó äõÔõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (and makes the day Nushur) meaning, people get up and go out to earn a living and attend to their business. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ÑøóÍúãóÊöåö ÌóÚóáó áóßõãõ Çáøóíúáó æóÇáäøóåóÇÑó áöÊóÓúßõäõæÇú İöíåö æóáöÊóÈÊóÛõæÇú ãöä İóÖúáöåö</div><br>  (It is out of His mercy that He has made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and that you may seek of His bounty...) (28:73)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÃóÑúÓóáó ÇáÑøöíóÜÍó ÈõÔúÑóì Èóíúäó íóÏóìú ÑóÍúãóÊöåö æóÃóäÒóáúäóÇ ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ãóÂÁğ ØóåõæÑÇğ </div><br>  </div></body></html>
