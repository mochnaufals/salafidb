It was reported that Muhammad bin Wasi` said, "I came to Makkah and there was a security out post over the trench whose guards took me to Marwan bin Al-Muhallab, who was the governor of Basrah. He said, `What do you need, O Abu `Abdullah' I said, `If you can do it, I need you to be like the brother of Banu `Adiy.' He said, `Who is the brother of Banu `Adiy' He said, `Al-`Ala' bin Ziyad; he once appointed a friend of his to a position of authority, and he wrote to him: If you can, only go to sleep after you make sure that there is nothing on your back i.e., you do not owe anything to anyone, your stomach is empty and your hands are untainted by the blood or wealth of the Muslims.

Marwan said, `He spoke the truth, by Allah, and gave sincere advice. ' Then he said, `What do you need, O Abu `Abdullah' I said, `I need you to let me join my family.' He said, `Yes I will do that.''' This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. When Allah condemned wrongdoing and the people who do it, and prescribed Al-Qisas, He encouraged forgiveness:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóãóä ÕóÈóÑó æóÛóİóÑó</div><br>  (And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives,) meaning, whoever bears the insult with patience and conceals the evil action,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Ğóáößó áóãöäú ÚóÒúãö ÇáÇøòãõæÑö</div><br>  (that would truly be from the things recommended by Allah.)
