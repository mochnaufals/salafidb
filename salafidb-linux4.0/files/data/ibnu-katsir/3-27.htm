Possessor of the power) meaning, all sovereignty is Yours,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõÄúÊöì Çáúãõáúßó ãóä ÊóÔóÂÁõ æóÊóäÒöÚõ Çáúãõáúßó ãöãøóä ÊóÔóÂÁõ æóÊõÚöÒøõ ãóä ÊóÔóÂÁõ æóÊõĞöáøõ ãóä ÊóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (You give power to whom You will, and You take power from whom You will, and You endue with honor whom You will, and You humiliate whom You will.) meaning, You are the Giver, You are the Taker, it is Your will that occurs and whatever You do not will, does not occur. This Ayah encourages thanking Allah for the favors He granted His Messenger and his Ummah. Allah transferred the prophethood from the Children of Israel to the Arab, Qurashi, Makkan, unlettered Prophet, the Final and Last of all Prophets and the Messenger of Allah to all mankind and Jinn. Allah endowed the Prophet with the best of qualities from the prophets before him. Allah also granted him extra qualities that no other Prophet or Messenger before him was endowed with, such as granting him (more) knowledge of Allah and His Law, knowledge of more of the matters of the past and the future, such as what will occur in the Hereafter. Allah allowed Muhammad's Ummah to reach the eastern and western parts of the world and gave dominance to his religion and Law over all other religions and laws. May Allah's peace and blessings be on the Prophet until the Day of Judgment, and as long as the day and night succeed each other. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáö Çááøóåõãøó ãóÜáößó Çáúãõáúßö</div><br>  (Say: "O Allah! Possessor of the power,'') meaning, You decide what You will concerning Your creation and You do what you will. Allah refutes those who thought that they could decide for Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú áóæúáÇó äõÒøöáó åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäõ Úóáóì ÑóÌõáò ãøöäó ÇáúŞóÑúíóÊóíúäö ÚóÙöíãò </div><br>  (And they say: "Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns (Makkah and Ta'if)'') 43:31.  Allah refuted them by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóåõãú íóŞúÓöãõæäó ÑóÍúãóÉó ÑóÈøößó</div><br>  (Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of your Lord) 43:32, meaning, "We decide for Our creation what We will, without resistance or hindrance by anyone. We have the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proof in all of this, and We give the prophethood to whom We will.'' Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÍóíúËõ íóÌúÚóáõ ÑöÓóÇáóÊóåõ</div><br>  (Allah knows best with whom to place His Message) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇäÙõÑú ßóíúİó İóÖøóáúäóÇ ÈóÚúÖóåõãú Úóáóì ÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (See how We prefer one above another (in this world)) 17: 21  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõæáöÌõ Çáøóíúáó İöì ÇáúäøóåóÇÑö æóÊõæáöÌõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑó İöì Çáøóíúáö</div><br>  (You make the night enter into the day, and You make the day enter into the night) meaning, You take from the length of one of them and add it to the shortness of the other, so that they become equal, and take from the length of one of them and add it to the other so that they are not equal. This occurs throughout the seasons of the year: spring, summer, fall and winter. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊõÎúÑöÌõ ÇáúÍóìøó ãöäó ÇáúãóíøöÊö æóÊõÎúÑöÌõ ÇáóãóíøöÊó ãöäó ÇáúÍóìøö</div><br>  (You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living.) means, You bring out the seed from the plant and the plant from the seed; the date from its seed and the date's seed from the date; the faithful from the disbeliever and the disbeliever from the faithful; the chicken from the egg and the egg from the chicken, etc.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑúÒõŞõ ãóä ÊóÔóÂÁõ ÈöÛóíúÑö ÍöÓóÇÈò</div><br>  (And You give wealth and sustenance to whom You will, without limit.) meaning, You give whomever You will innumerable amounts of wealth while depriving others from it, out of wisdom, and justice.  </div></body></html>
