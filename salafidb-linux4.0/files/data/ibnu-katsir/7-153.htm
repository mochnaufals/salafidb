Certainly, those who took the calf (for worship), wrath from their Lord and humiliation will come upon them in the life of this world. Thus do We recompense those who invent lies.) (153. But those who committed evil deeds and then repented afterwards and believed, verily, your Lord after (all) that is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)  The `wrath' mentioned here that struck the Children of Israel because of their worshipping the calf, means, Allah did not accept their repentance until some of them who did not worship the calf killed others who worshipped the calf. We mentioned this story in Surat Al-Baqarah,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊõæÈõæÇú Åöáóì ÈóÇÑöÆößõãú İóÇŞúÊõáõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóßõãú Ğóáößõãú ÎóíúÑñ áøóßõãú ÚöäÏó ÈóÇÑöÆößõãú İóÊóÇÈó Úóáóíúßõãú Åöäøóåõ åõæó ÇáÊøóæøóÇÈõ ÇáÑøóÍöíãõ</div><br>  (So turn in repentance to your Creator and kill yourselves (the guilty), that will be better for you before your Creator.'' Then He accepted your repentance. Truly, He is the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.) 2:54 As for the humiliation mentioned in the Ayah, it pertains to the disgrace and humiliation that the Jews suffered in the life of this world. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞóáößó äóÌúÒöì ÇáúãõİúÊóÑöíäó</div><br>  (Thus do We recompense those who invent lies) is for all those who invent an innovation (in religion). Surely, the disgrace resulting from inventing an innovation (in religion) and defying Allah's Message, will be placed in the heart and from there on to the shoulders. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said; "The disgrace of innovation will weigh on their shoulders even if they were to gallop on their mules or trot on their work horses.'' Ayyub As-Sakhtiyani narrated from Abu Qilabah Al-Jarmi that he commented on this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞóáößó äóÌúÒöì ÇáúãõİúÊóÑöíäó</div><br>  (Thus do We recompense those who invent lies.) "By Allah! This Ayah is for all those who invent a lie, until the Day of Resurrection.'' Also, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah said, "Every person who invents a Bid`ah (innovation in the religion) will taste disgrace.''Allah tells His servants that He accepts repentance from His servants for any sin, even Shirk, Kufr, hypocrisy and disobedience. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÇÊö Ëõãøó ÊóÇÈõæÇú ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåóÇ æóÁóÇãóäõæÇú Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó</div><br>  (But those who committed evil deeds and then repented afterwards and believed, verily, your Lord) O Muhammad, Messenger of Repentance and Prophet of Mercy,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåóÇ</div><br>  (after that) after committing that evil action,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) Ibn Abi Hatim reported that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud was asked about a man committing fornication with a woman and then marrying her, and Ibn Mas`ud recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÇÊö Ëõãøó ÊóÇÈõæÇú ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåóÇ æóÁóÇãóäõæÇú Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåóÇ áóÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (But those who committed evil deeds and then repented afterwards and believed, verily, your Lord after (all) that is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)  `Abdullah recited this Ayah ten times, neither allowing nor disallowing it.  </div></body></html>
