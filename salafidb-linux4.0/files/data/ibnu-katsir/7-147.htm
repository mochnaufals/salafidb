Allah says, "I shall deprive the hearts of those who are too proud to obey Me, and arrogant with people without right, from understanding the signs and proofs that testify to My Might, Law and Commandments.'' And just as they acted arrogantly without justification, Allah has disgraced them with ignorance. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõŞóáøöÈõ ÃóİúÆöÏóÊóåõãú æóÃóÈúÕóÜÑóåõãú ßóãóÇ áóãú íõÄúãöäõæÇú Èöåö Ãóæøóáó ãóÑøóÉò</div><br>  (And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance), as they refused to believe therein for the first time) 6:110, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÒóÇÛõæÇú ÃóÒóÇÛó Çááøóåõ ŞõáõæÈóåõãú</div><br>  (So when they turned away (from the path of Allah), Allah turned their hearts away (from the right path).) 61:5 Sufyan bin `Uyaynah commented on this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÃóÕúÑöİõ Úóäú ÁóÇíóÜÊöí ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÊóßóÈøóÑõæäó İöí ÇáÃóÑúÖö ÈöÛóíúÑö ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (I shall turn away from My Ayat those who behave arrogantly on the earth, without a right), "(Allah says) I shall snatch away comprehension of the Qur'an from them and turn them away from My Ayat. '' Ibn Jarir commented on Sufyan's statement that, "This indicates that this part of the Ayah is addressed to this Ummah.'' This is not necessarily true, for Ibn `Uyaynah actually meant that this occurs in every Ummah and that there is no difference between one Ummah and another Ummah in this regard. Allah knows best. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä íóÑóæúÇú ßõáøó ÁóÇíóÉò áÇøó íõÄúãöäõæÇú ÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (and (even) if they see all the Ayat, they will not believe in them).

Allah explains why they do this,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú ßóĞøóÈõæÇú ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ</div><br>  (that is because they have rejected Our Ayat), in their hearts,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäõæÇú ÚóäúåóÇ ÛóÜİöáöíäó</div><br>  (and were heedless of them.), gaining no lessons from the Ayat.

Surely, as you bring forth, you reap the harvest thereof.'  </div></body></html>
