Everything prostrates to His might, willingly or unwillingly, and everything prostrates in a manner that befits its nature, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæó áóãúíóÑóæúÇú ÅöáóìÎóáóŞó Çááøóåõ ãöä ÔóìúÁò íóÊóİóíøóÃõ ÙöáóÜáõåõ Úóäö Çáúíóãöíäö æóÇáúÔøóãóÂÆöáö ÓõÌøóÏğÇ áöáøóåö æóåõãú</div><br>  (Have they not observed things that Allah has created: (how) their shadows incline to the right and to the left, making prostration unto Allah, and they are lowly) 16:48.

In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that Abu Dharr said, "The Messenger of Allah said to me,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊóÏúÑöí Ãóíúäó ÊóĞúåóÈõ åóĞöåö ÇáÔøóãúÓõ¿»</div><br>  (Do you know where this sun goes) I said, `Allah and His Messenger know best.'

Soon it will be told, "Go back the way whence you came.'')'' Ibn `Abbas said, "A man came and said, `O Messenger of Allah, I saw myself in a dream last night, as if I was praying behind a tree. I prostrated, and the tree prostrated when I did, and I heard it saying, "O Allah, write down a reward for me for that, and remove a sin from me for that, store it with You for me and accept it from me as You accepted from Your servant Dawud.''' Ibn `Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah recited an Ayah mentioning a prostration, then he prostrated, and I heard him saying the same words that the man had told him the tree said.'' This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Hibban in his Sahih.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÏøóæóÂÈøö</div><br>  (Ad-Dawabb) means all the animals. It was reported in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad that the Messenger of Allah forbade using the backs of animals as platforms for speaking, for, perhaps the one who was being ridden was better and remembered Allah more than the one who was riding.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóËöíÑñ ãøöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (and many of mankind) means, they prostrate willingly, submitting themselves to Allah of their own free will.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóËöíÑñ ÍóŞøó Úóáóíúåö ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ</div><br>  (But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified.) means, those who refuse prostration, are stubborn and arrogant.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõåöäö Çááøóåõ İóãóÇ áóåõ ãöä ãøõßúÑöãò Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóİúÚóáõ ãóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honor him. Verily, Allah does what He wills.) It was recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ŞóÑóÃó ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó ÇáÓøóÌúÏóÉó ÇÚúÊóÒóáó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäõ íóÈúßöí¡ íóŞõæáõ: íóÇ æóíúáóåõ ÃõãöÑó ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó ÈöÇáÓøõÌõæÏö İóÓóÌóÏó İóáóåõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉõ¡ æóÃõãöÑúÊõ ÈöÇáÓøõÌõæÏö İóÃóÈóíúÊõ İóáöíó ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (When the son of Adam recites the Ayat containing the prostration, the Shaytan withdraws weeping and says, "Ah! Woe (to me)! the son of Adam was commanded to prostrate and he prostrated, so Paradise is his; I was commanded to prostrate and I refused, so I am doomed to Hell.'') This was recorded by Muslim. In his book Al-Marasil, Abu Dawud recorded that Khalid bin Ma`dan, may Allah have mercy upon him, reported that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İõÖøöáóÊú ÓõæÑóÉõ ÇáúÍóÌøö Úóáóì ÓóÇÆöÑö ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö ÈöÓóÌúÏóÊóíúä»</div><br>  (Surat Al-Hajj has been favored over the rest of the Qur'an with two prostrations.'') Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Isma`ili recorded from Abu Al-Jahm that `Umar did the two prostrations of Surat Al-Hajj when he was in Al-Jabiyah, and he said, "This Surah has been favored with two prostrations.''  </div></body></html>
