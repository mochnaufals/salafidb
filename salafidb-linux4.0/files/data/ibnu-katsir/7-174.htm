Or lest you should say: "It was only our fathers aforetime who took others as partners in worship along with Allah, and we were (merely their) descendants after them; will You then destroy us because of the deeds of men who practiced falsehood'') (174.

Allah placed a glimmering light between the eyes of each one of them. Allah showed them to Adam and Adam asked, `O Lord! Who are they' Allah said, `These are your offspring.' Adam saw a man from among them whose light he liked. He asked, `O Lord! Who is this man' Allah said, `This is a man from the latter generations of your offspring. His name is Dawud.' Adam said, `O Lord! How many years would he live' Allah said, `Sixty years.' Adam said, `O Lord! I have forfeited forty years from my life for him.' When Adam's life came to an end, the angel of death came to him (to take his soul). Adam said, `I still have forty years from my life term, don't I' He said, `Have you not given it to your son Dawud' So Adam denied that and his offspring followed suit (denying Allah's covenant), Adam forgot and his offspring forgot, Adam made a mistake and his offspring made mistakes.) At-Tirmidhi said, "This Hadith is Hasan Sahih, and it was reported from various chains of narration through Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet ''. Al-Hakim also recorded it in his Mustadrak, and said; "Sahih according to the criteria of Muslim, and they did not record it.'' These and similar Hadiths testify that Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, brought forth Adam's offspring from his loins and separated between the inhabitants of Paradise and those of the Fire. Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÔúåóÏóåõãú Úóáóì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú ÃóáóÓúÊó ÈöÑóÈøößõãú ŞóÇáõæÇú Èóáóì</div><br>  (and made them testify as to themselves (saying): "Am I not your Lord'' They said: "Yes!'') Therefore, Allah made them testify with themselves by circumstance and words. Testimony is sometimes given in words, such as,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú ÔóåöÏúäóÇ Úóáóì ÃóäúİõÓöäóÇ</div><br>  (They will say: "We bear witness against ourselves.'') 6:130 At other times, testimony is given by the people themselves, such as Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ßóÇäó áöáúãõÔúÑößöíäó Ãóä íóÚúãõÑõæÇú ãóÓóÇÌöÏó Çááå ÔóÜåöÏöíäó Úóáóì ÃóäİõÓöåöã ÈöÇáúßõİúÑö</div><br>  (It is not for the Mushrikin, (polytheists) to maintain the mosques of Allah, while they testify against their own selves of disbelief.) 9:17 This Ayah means that their disbelief testifies against them, not that they actually testify against themselves here. Another Ayah of this type is Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõ Úóáóì Ğóáößó áóÔóåöíÏñ </div><br>  (And to that he bears witness (by his deeds). ) 100:7 The same is the case with asking, sometimes takes the form of words and sometimes a situation or circumstance. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÂÊóÇßõã ãøöä ßõáøö ãóÇ ÓóÃóáúÊõãõæåõ</div><br>  (And He gave you of all that you asked for.) 14:34 Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä ÊóŞõæáõæÇú</div><br>  (lest you should say), on the Day of Resurrection   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ Úóäú åóÜĞóÇ</div><br>  (we were of this) of Tawhid   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÛóÜİöáöíäóÃóæú ÊóŞõæáõæÇú ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóÔúÑóßó ÁóÇÈóÇÄõäóÇ</div><br>  (unaware.
