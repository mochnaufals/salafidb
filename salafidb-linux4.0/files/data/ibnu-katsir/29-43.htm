In this regard, they were like the house of a spider, which is so weak and frail, because by clinging to these gods they were like a person who holds on to a spider's web, who does not gain any benefit from that. If they knew this, they would not take any protectors besides Allah. This is unlike the Muslim believer, whose heart is devoted to Allah, yet he still does righteous deeds and follows the Laws of Allah, for he has grasped the most trustworthy handle that will never break because it is so strong and firm. Then Allah warns those who worship others besides Him and associate others with Him that He knows what they do and the rivals they associate with Him. He will punish them for their attribution, for He is All-Wise and All-Knowing. Then He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊöáúßó ÇáÇøñãúËóÇáõ äóÖúÑöÈõåóÇ áöáäøóÇÓö æóãóÇ íóÚúŞöáõåóÂ ÅöáÇøó ÇáúÚóÜáöãõæäó </div><br>  (And these are the examples We give for mankind; but none will understand them except those who have knowledge.) meaning, no one understands them or ponders them except those who are possessed of deep knowledge.
