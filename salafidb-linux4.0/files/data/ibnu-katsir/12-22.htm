He also ordered his wife to be kind to Yusuf and had good hopes for his future, because of his firm righteous behavior. He said to his wife,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóßúÑöãöì ãóËúæóÇåõ ÚóÓóì Ãóä íóäİóÚóäóÂ Ãóæú äóÊøóÎöĞóåõ æóáóÏğÇ</div><br>  (Make his stay comfortable, maybe he will profit us or we shall adopt him as a son.) The man who bought Yusuf was the minister of Egypt at the time, and his title was `Aziz'. Abu Ishaq narrated that Abu `Ubaydah said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "Three had the most insight: the `Aziz of Egypt, who said to his wife,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóßúÑöãöì ãóËúæóÇåõ</div><br>  (Make his stay comfortable...), the woman who said to her father,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóÈóÊö ÇÓúÊóÜúÌöÑúåõ</div><br>  (O my father! Hire him...), 28:26 and Abu Bakr As-Siddiq when he appointed `Umar bin Al-Khattab to be the Khalifah after him, may Allah be pleased with them both.'' Allah said next that just as He saved Yusuf from his brothers,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößóãóßøóäøóÇ áöíõæÓõİó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Thus did We establish Yusuf in the land), in reference to Egypt,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöäõÚóáøöãóåõ ãöä ÊóÃúæöíáö ÇáÇøñÍóÇÏöíËö</div><br>  (that We might teach him the interpretation of events.) the interpretation of dreams, according to Mujahid and As-Suddi. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÛóÇáöÈñ Úóáóì ÃóãúÑöåö</div><br>  (And Allah has full power and control over His affairs,) if He wills something, then there is no averting His decision, nor can it ever be stopped or contradicted. Rather, Allah has full power over everything and everyone else. Sa`id bin Jubayr said while commenting on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÛóÇáöÈñ Úóáóì ÃóãúÑöåö</div><br>  (And Allah has full power and control over His affairs,) "He does what ever He wills.''

Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóãøóÇ ÈóáóÛó</div><br>  (And when he attained), in reference to Prophet Yusuf, peace be upon him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÔõÏøóåõ</div><br>  (his full manhood), sound in mind and perfect in body,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÂÊóíúäóÇåõ ÍõßúãğÇ æóÚöáúãğÇ</div><br>  (We gave him wisdom and knowledge), which is the prophethood that Allah sent him with for the people he lived among,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞóáößó äóÌúÒöì ÇáúãõÍúÓöäöíäó</div><br>  (thus We reward the doers of good.) because Yusuf used to do good in the obedience of Allah the Exalted.  </div></body></html>
