Sometimes He casts something into the heart of the Prophet , and he has no doubt that it is from Allah, as it was reported in Sahih Ibn Hibban that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÑõæúÍó ÇáúŞõÏõÓö äóİóËó İöí ÑõæÚöí Ãóäøó äóİúÓğÇ áóäú ÊóãõæÊó ÍóÊúì ÊóÓúÊóßúãöáó ÑöÒúŞóåóÇ æóÃóÌóáóåóÇ¡ İóÇÊøóŞõæÇ Çááåó æóÃóÌúãöáõæÇ İöí ÇáØøóáóÈ»</div><br>  (Ar-Ruh Al-Qudus i.e., Jibril breathed into my heart that no soul will die until its allotted provision and time have expired, so have Taqwa of Allah and keep seeking in a good (and lawful) way.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ãöä æóÑóÂÁö ÍöÌóÇÈò</div><br>  (or from behind a veil) -- as He spoke to Musa, peace be upon him. He asked to see Him after He had spoken to him, but this was not granted to him. In the Sahih, it recorded that the Messenger of Allah said to Jabir bin `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ßóáøóãó Çááåõ ÃóÍóÏğÇ ÅöáøóÇ ãöäú æóÑóÇÁö ÍöÌóÇÈò¡ æóÅöäøóåõ ßóáøóãó ÃóÈóÇßó ßöİóÇÍğÇ»</div><br>  (Allah never speaks to anyone except from behind a veil, but He spoke to your father directly.) This is how it was stated in the Hadith. He Jabir's father was killed on the day of Uhud, but this refers to the realm of Al-Barzakh, whereas the Ayah speaks of this earthly realm.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú íõÑúÓöáó ÑóÓõæáÇğ İóíõæÍöìó ÈöÅöĞúäöåö ãóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His leave.) as Jibril, peace be upon him, and other angels came down to the Prophets, peace be upon them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ Úóáöìøñ Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.) He is Most High, All-Knowing, Most Wise.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞóáößó ÃóæúÍóíúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó ÑõæÍÇğ ãøöäú ÃóãúÑöäóÇ</div><br>  (And thus We have sent to you Ruh of Our command.) means, the Qur'an.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ßõäÊó ÊóÏúÑöì ãóÇ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈõ æóáÇó ÇáÅöíãóÜäõ</div><br>  (You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith.) means, `in the details which were given to you in the Qur'an.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöä ÌóÚóáúäóÜåõ</div><br>  (But We have made it) means, the Qur'an,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äõæÑÇğ äøóåúÏöì Èöåö ãóä äøóÔóÂÁõ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöäóÇ</div><br>  (a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our servants We will. ) This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú åõÏğì æóÔöİóÂÁñ æóÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó İöì ÁóÇĞóÇäöåöãú æóŞúÑñ æóåõæó Úóáóíúåöãú Úóãğì</div><br>  (Say: "It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Qur'an) is blindness for them.'') (41:44).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóßó</div><br>  (And verily, you) means, `O Muhammad,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÊóåúÏöì Åöáóì ÕöÑóØò ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò</div><br>  (are indeed guiding to a straight path.) means, the correct behavior. Then Allah explains this further by saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÕöÑóØö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (The path of Allah) meaning, His Laws which He enjoins.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì áóåõ ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth.) means, their Lord and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling and ruling them, Whose decree cannot be overturned.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇó Åöáóì Çááøóåö ÊóÕöíÑõ ÇáÇøòãõæÑõ</div><br>  (Verily, all matters at the end go to Allah.) means, all matters come back to Him and He issues judgement concerning them. Glorified and exalted be He far above all that the evildoers and deniers say. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ash-Shura   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
