This is like the following Ayat, in which the verbs appear in the past tense in Arabic:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÊóÑóÈó áöáäøóÇÓö ÍöÓóÜÈõåõãú æóåõãú İöì ÛóİúáóÉò ãøõÚúÑöÖõæäó </div><br>  (Mankind's reckoning has drawn near them, while they turn away in heedlessness.)21:1   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÊóÑóÈóÊö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ æóÇäÔóŞøó ÇáúŞóãóÑõ </div><br>  (The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft.) 54:1   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõæåõ</div><br>  (so do not seek to hasten it.) means, what was far is now near, so do not try to rush it.

Ibn Abi Hatim reported from `Uqbah bin `Amir that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóØúáõÚõ Úóáóíúßõãú ÚöäúÏó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÓóÍóÇÈóÉñ ÓóæúÏóÇÁõ ãöäó ÇáúãóÛúÑöÈö ãöËúáó ÇáÊøõÑúÓö¡ İóãóÇ ÊóÒóÇáõ ÊóÑúÊóİöÚõ İöí ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö Ëõãøó íõäóÇÏöí ãõäóÇÏò İöíåóÇ: íóÇ ÃóíøõåóÇÇáäøóÇÓõ İóíõŞúÈöáõ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÈóÚúÖõåõãú Úóáóì ÈóÚúÖò: åóáú ÓóãöÚúÊõãú¡ İóãöäúåõãú ãóäú íóŞõæáõ: äóÚóãú¡ æóãöäúåõãú ãóäú íóÔõßøõ¡ Ëõãøó íõäóÇÏöí ÇáËøóÇäöíóÉó: íóÇ ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ İóíóŞõæáõ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÈóÚúÖõåõãú áöÈóÚúÖò: åóáú ÓóãöÚúÊõãú¡ İóíóŞõæáõæäó: äóÚóãú¡ Ëõãøó íõäóÇÏöí ÇáËøóÇáöËóÉó: íóÇ ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÃóÊóì ÃóãúÑõ Çááåö İóáóÇ ÊóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõæå»</div><br>  (When the Hour approaches, a black cloud resembling a shield will emerge upon from the west. It will continue rising in the sky, then a voice will call out, `O mankind!' The people will say to one another, `Did you hear that' Some will say, `yes', but others will doubt it. Then a second call will come, `O mankind!' The people will say to one another, `Did you hear that' And they will say, `Yes.' Then a third call will come, `O mankind!' The Event ordained by Allah has indeed come, so do not seek to hasten it.') The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóæó ÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö¡ Åöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáóíúäö áóíóäúÔõÑóÇäö ÇáËøóæÈó İóãóÇ íóØúæöíóÇäöåö ÃóÈóÏğÇ¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáó áóíóãõÏøóäøó ÍóæúÖóåõ İóãóÇ íóÓúŞöí İöíåö ÔóíúÆğÇ ÃóÈóÏğÇ¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáó áóíóÍúáõÈõ äóÇŞóÊóåõ İóãóÇ íóÔúÑöÈõåõ ÃóÈóÏğÇ ŞóÇáó æóíóÔúÊóÛöáõ ÇáäøóÇÓ»</div><br>  (By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, two men will spread out a cloth, but will never refold it; a man will prepare his trough, but will never water his animals from it; and a man will milk his camel, but will never drink the milk.'' Then he said, "The people will be distracted.'') Then Allah tells us that He is free from their allegations of partners to their worship of idols, and making equals for Him. Glorified and exalted be He far above that. These are the people who deny the Hour, so He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓõÈúÍóÇäóåõ æóÊóÚóÇáóì ÚóãøóÇ íõÔúÑößõæäó</div><br>  (Glorified and Exalted be He above all that they associate as partners with Him. )  </div></body></html>
