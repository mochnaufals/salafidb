These six days are: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. On Friday, the entire creation was assembled and on that day, Adam was created. There is a difference of opinion whether these days were the same as our standard days as suddenly comes to the mind, or each day constitutes one thousand years, as reported from Mujahid, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, and from Ibn `Abbas according to Ad-Dahhak's narration from him. As for Saturday, no creation took place in it since it is the seventh day of (of the week). The word `As-Sabt' means stoppage, or break. Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Hurayrah saying: `Allah's Messenger told me:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÎóáóŞó Çááåõ¡ (ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó)¡ ÇáÊøõÑúÈóÉó íóæúãó ÇáÓøóÈúÊö¡ æóÎóáóŞó İöíåóÇ ÇáúÌöÈóÇáó íóæúãó ÇáúÃóÍóÏö¡ æóÎóáóŞó ÇáÔøóÌóÑó íóæúãó ÇáúÇËúäóíúäö¡ æóÎóáóŞó ÇáúãóßúÑõæåó íóæúãó ÇáËøõáóÇËóÇÁö¡ æóÎóáóŞó ÇáäøõæÑó íóæúãó ÇáúÃóÑúÈöÚóÇÁö¡ æóÈóËøó İöíåóÇ ÇáÏøóæóÇÈøó íóæúãó ÇáúÎóãöíÓö¡ æóÎóáóŞó ÂÏóãó¡ Úóáóíúåö ÇáÓøóáóÇãõ¡ ÈóÚúÏó ÇáúÚóÕúÑö ãöäú íóæúã ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö¡ İöí ÂÎöÑö ÇáúÎóáúŞö¡ İöí ÂÎöÑö ÓóÇÚóÉò ãöäú ÓóÇÚóÇÊö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö¡ İöíãóÇ Èóíúäó ÇáúÚóÕúÑö Åöáóì Çááøóíúá»</div><br>  . (Allah created the dust on Saturday, and He created the mountains on Sunday, and He created the trees on Monday, and He created the unpleasant things on Tuesday and He created the light on Wednesday and He spread the creatures through out it on Thursday and He created Adam after `Asr on Friday. He was the last created during the last hour of Friday, between `Asr and the night.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Meaning of Istawa</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  As for Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÇÓúÊóæóì Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÑúÔö</div><br>  (and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne) the people had several conflicting opinions over its meaning. However, we follow the way that our righteous predecessors took in this regard, such as Malik, Al-Awza`i, Ath-Thawri, Al-Layth bin Sa`d, Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad, Ishaq bin Rahwayh and the rest of the scholars of Islam, in past and present times. Surely, we accept the apparent meaning of, Al-Istawa, without discussing its true essence, equating it (with the attributes of the creation), or altering or denying it (in any way or form). We also believe that the meaning that comes to those who equate Allah with the creation is to be rejected, for nothing is similar to Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó ßóãöËúáöåö ÔóìúÁñ æóåõæó ÇáÓøóãöíÚõ ÇáúÈóÕöíÑõ</div><br>  (There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.) 42:11 Indeed, we assert and affirm what the Imams said, such as Nu`aym bin Hammad Al-Khuza'i, the teacher of Imam Al-Bukhari, who said, "Whoever likens Allah with His creation, will have committed Kufr. Whoever denies what Allah has described Himself with, will have committed Kufr. Certainly, there is no resemblance (of Allah with the creation) in what Allah and His Messenger have described Him with. Whoever attests to Allah's attributes that the plain Ayat and authentic Hadiths have mentioned, in the manner that suits Allah's majesty, all the while rejecting all shortcomings from Him, will have taken the path of guidance.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Day and the Night are among the Signs of Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÛúÔöì Çáøóíúáó ÇáäøóåóÇÑó íóØúáõÈõåõ ÍóËöíËğÇ</div><br>  (He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly,) meaning, the darkness goes away with the light, and the light goes away with the darkness. Each of them seeks the other rapidly, and does not come late, for when this vanishes, the other comes, and vice versa. Allah also said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇíóÉñ áøóåõãõ Çáøóíúáõ äóÓúáóÎõ ãöäúåõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑó İóÅöĞóÇ åõã ãøõÙúáöãõæäó - æóÇáÔøóãúÓõ ÊóÌúÑöì áöãõÓúÊóŞóÑøò áøóåóÜÇ Ğóáößó ÊóŞúÏöíÑõ ÇáúÚóÒöíÒö ÇáúÚóáöíãö - æóÇáúŞóãóÑó ŞóÏøóÑúäóÜåõ ãóäóÇÒöáó ÍóÊøóì ÚóÇÏó ßóÇáÚõÑÌõæäö ÇáúŞóÏöíãö - áÇó ÇáÔøóãúÓõ íóäÈóÛöì áóåóÂ Ãóä ÊÏúÑößó ÇáŞóãóÑó æóáÇó Çáøóíúáõ ÓóÇÈöŞõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑö æóßõáøñ İöì İóáóßò íóÓúÈóÍõæäó </div><br>  (And a sign for them is the night.
