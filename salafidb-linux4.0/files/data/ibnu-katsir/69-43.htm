These also indicate the perfection of His Names and Attributes. He then swears by the hidden things that they cannot see. This is an oath swearing that the Qur'an is His Speech, His inspiration and His revelation to His servant and Messenger, whom He chose to convey His Message, and the Messenger carried out this trust faithfully. So Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÃõŞúÓöãõ ÈöãóÇ ÊõÈúÕöÑõæäó - æóãóÇ áÇó ÊõÈúÕöÑõæäó - Åöäøóåõ áóŞóæúáõ ÑóÓõæáò ßóÑöíãò </div><br>  (So I swear by whatsoever you see, and by whatsoever you see not, that this is verily the word of an honored Messenger.) meaning, Muhammad . Allah gave this description to him, a description which carries the meaning of conveying, because the duty of a messenger is to convey from the sender. Therefore, Allah gave this description to the angelic Messenger in Surat At-Takwir, where he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ áóŞóæúáõ ÑóÓõæáò ßóÑöíãò Ğöì ŞõæøóÉò ÚöäÏó Ğöì ÇáúÚóÑúÔö ãóßöíäò ãøõØóÜÚò Ëóãøó Ãóãöíäò </div><br>  (Verily, this is the Word of (this Qur'an brought by) a most honorable messenger. Owner of power (and high rank) with Allah, the Lord of the Throne. Obeyed and trustworthy.) (81:19-21) And here, it refers to Jibril. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÕóÜÍöÈõßõãú ÈöãóÌúäõæäò </div><br>  (and your companion is not a madman. ) (81:22) meaning, Muhammad .   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÑóÁóÇåõ ÈöÇáÇøòİõŞö ÇáúãõÈöíäö </div><br>  (And indeed he saw him in the clear horizon.) (81:23) meaning, Muhammad saw Jibril in his true form in which Allah created him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ åõæó Úóáóì ÇáúÛóíúÈö ÈöÖóäöíäò </div><br>  (And he is not Danin with the Unseen.) (81:24) meaning, suspicious.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ åõæó ÈöŞóæúáö ÔóíúØóÜäò ÑøóÌöíãò </div><br>  (And it (the Qur'an) is not he word of the outcast Shaytan.) (81:25) This is similar to what is being said here.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ åõæó ÈöŞóæúáö ÔóÇÚöÑò ŞóáöíáÇğ ãøóÇ ÊõÄúãöäõæäó - æóáÇó ÈöŞóæúáö ßóÇåöäò ŞóáöíáÇğ ãøóÇ ÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó </div><br>  (It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe! Nor is it the word of soothsayer, little is that you remember!) So in one instance Allah applies the term messenger to the angelic Messenger and in another instance He applies it to the human Messenger (Muhammad ). This is because both of them are conveying from Allah that which has been entrusted to them of Allah's revelation and Speech. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóäÒöíáñ ãøöä ÑøóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (This is the revelation sent down from the Lord of all that exists.)  </div></body></html>
