Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Each one (believer and disbeliever, etc.) is waiting, so wait you too, and you shall know who are they that are on the Straight and Even Path (i.e. Allahs Religion of Islamic Monotheism), and who are they that have let themselves be guided (on the Right Path). )</div> <br>   						 		 <br><h2>The Request of the Polytheists for Proofs while the Qur'an is itself a Proof</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah, the Exalted, informs about the disbelievers in their statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæúáÇó</div><br>  (Why does not) This means, `Why doesn't Muhammad bring us some proof from his Lord' They meant a sign that was proof of his truthfulness in his claim that he was the Messenger of Allah.

Yet, the Qur'an contains information about the people of the past that tells of their events from times long ago and it agrees with the authentic information in the previous Books concerning these matters. The Qur'an is the supervisor of these other Books. It verifies what is correct and explains the mistakes that were falsely placed in these Books and attributed to them. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement in Surat Al-`Ankabut,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú áóæúáÇó ÃõäÒöáó Úóáóíúåö ÁÇíóÜÊñ ãøöä ÑøóÈøöåö Şõáú ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáÇøñíóÜÊõ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö æóÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóäóÇú äóĞöíÑñ ãøõÈöíäñ - Ãóæóáóãú íóßúİöåöãú ÃóäøóÂ ÃóäÒóáúäóÇ Úóáóíúßó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó íõÊúáóì Úóáóíúåöãú Åöäøó İöì Ğáößó áóÑóÍúãóÉğ æóĞößúÑóì áöŞóæúãò íõÄúãöäõæäó </div><br>  (And they say: "Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord'' Say: "The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.''

In this Hadith, the Prophet only mentioned the greatest of the signs that he was given, which is the Qur'an. However, he did have other miracles, which were innumerable and limitless. These miracles have all been recorded in the books that discuss them, and they have been affirmed in the places that mention them.
