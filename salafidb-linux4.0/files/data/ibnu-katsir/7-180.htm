For instance, in his Musnad, Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÃóÕóÇÈó ÃóÍóÏğÇ ŞóØøõ åóãøñ æóáóÇ ÍóÒóäñ İóŞóÇáó: Çááøóåõãøó Åöäøöí ÚóÈúÏõßó¡ ÇÈúäõ ÃóãóÊößó¡ äóÇÕöíóÊöí ÈöíóÏößó ãóÇÖò İöíøó Íõßúãõßó¡ ÚóÏúáñ İöíøó ŞóÖõÇÄõßó¡ ÃóÓúÃóáõßó Èößõáøö ÇÓúãò åõæó áóßó ÓóãøóíúÊó Èöåö äóİúÓóßó Ãóæú ÃóäúÒóáúÊóåõåöİí ßöÊóÇÈößó Ãóæú ÚóáøóãúÊóåõ ÃóÍóÏğÇ ãöäú ÎóáúŞößó Ãóæö ÇÓúÊóÃúËóÑúÊó Èöåö İöí Úöáúãö ÇáúÛóíúÈö ÚöäúÏóßó Ãóäú ÊóÌúÚóáó ÇáúŞõÑÂäó ÇáúÚóÙöíãó ÑóÈöíÚó ŞóáúÈöí¡ æóäõæÑó ÕóÏúÑöí¡ æóÌóáóÇÁó ÍõÒúäöí¡ æóĞóåóÇÈó åóãøöí¡ ÅöáøóÇ ÃóĞúåóÈó Çááåõ ÍõÒúäóåõ æóåóãøóåõ æóÃóÈúÏóáó ãóßóÇäóåõ İóÑóÍğÇ»</div><br>  (Any person who is overcome by sadness or grief and supplicates, `O Allah! I am Your servant, son of Your female servant. My forelock is in Your Hand. Your decision concerning me shall certainly come to pass. Just is Your Judgement about me. I invoke You by every Name that You have and that You called Yourself by, sent down in Your Book, taught to any of Your creatures, or kept with You in the knowledge of the Unseen that is with You. Make the Glorious Qur'an the spring of my heart, the light of my chest, the remover of my grief and the dissipater of my concern.' Surely, Allah will remove his grief and sadness and exchange them for delight.) The Prophet was asked "O Messenger of Allah!

Qatadah stated that Ilhad refers to associating others with Allah in His Names (such as calling an idol Al-`Uzza). The word Ilhad used in the Ayah in another from means deviation, wickedness, injustice and straying. The hole in the grave is called Lahd, because it is a hole within a hole, that is turned towards the Qiblah (the direction of the prayer).  </div></body></html>
