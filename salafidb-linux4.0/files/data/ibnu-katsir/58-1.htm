"The woman who disputed'' came to the Prophet and argued with him while I was in another part of the room, unable to hear what she said. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÓóãöÚó Çááøóåõ Şóæúáó ÇáøóÊöì ÊõÌóÇÏöáõßó İöì ÒóæúÌöåóÇ</div><br>  (Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband.)'' till the end of this Ayah. Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith without a chain of narration in the Book of Tawhid in his Sahih. An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir also collected this Hadith. In the narration that Ibn Abi Hatim collected, `A'ishah said, "Blessed is He, Whose hearing has encompassed all things. I heard what Khawlah bint Tha`labah said while some of it I could not hear. She was complaining to Allah's Messenger about her husband. She said, `O Allah's Messenger! He spent my wealth, exhausted my youth and my womb bore abundantly for him. When I be- came old, unable to bear children, he pronounced the Ziharon me! O Allah! I complain to you.' Soon after, Jibril brought down this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÓóãöÚó Çááøóåõ Şóæúáó ÇáøóÊöì ÊõÌóÇÏöáõßó İöì ÒóæúÌöåóÇ</div><br>  (Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband,)'' She added, "Her husband was Aws bin As-Samit.''  </div></body></html>
