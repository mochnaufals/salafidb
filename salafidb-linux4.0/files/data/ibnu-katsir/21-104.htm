This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ŞóÏóÑõæÇú Çááøóåó ÍóŞøó ŞóÏúÑöåö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ÌóãöíÚÜÇğ ŞóÈúÖóÜÊõåõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö æóÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊõ ãóØúæöíøóÜÊñ Èöíóãöíäöåö ÓõÈúÍóÜäóåõ æóÊóÚóÇáóì ÚóãøóÇ íõÔúÑößõæäó </div><br>  (They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified be He, and High be He above all that they associate as partners with Him!) 39:67 Al-Bukhari recorded that Nafi` reported from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó íóŞúÈöÖõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÇáúÃóÑóÖöíäó æóÊóßõæäõ ÇáÓøóãóæóÇÊõ Èöíóãöíäöå»</div><br>  (On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will seize the earth and the heavens will be in His Right Hand.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóØóìøö ÇáÓøöÌöáøö áöáúßõÊõÈö</div><br>  (like a Sijill rolled up for books.) What is meant by Sijill is book. As-Suddi said concerning this Ayah: "As-Sijill is an angel who is entrusted with the records; when a person dies, his Book (of deeds) is taken up to As-Sijill, and he rolls it up and puts it away until the Day of Resurrection.'' But the correct view as narrated from Ibn `Abbas is that As-Sijill refers to the record (of deeds). This was also reported from him by `Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-`Awfi. This was also stated by Mujahid, Qatadah and others. This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir, because this usage is well-known in the (Arabic) language. Based on the above, the meaning is: the Day when the heaven will be rolled up like a scroll. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÃóÓúáóãóÇ æóÊóáøóåõ áöáúÌóÈöíäö </div><br>  (Then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the will of Allah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead.) 37:103 There are many more linguistic examples in this respect. Allah knows best.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóãóÇ ÈóÏóÃúäóÂ Ãóæøóáó ÎóáúŞò äøõÚöíÏõåõ æóÚúÏÇğ ÚóáóíúäóÂ ÅöäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ İóÜÚöáöíäó</div><br>  (As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it.) means, this will inevitably come to pass on the Day when Allah creates His creation anew. As He created them in the first place, He is surely able to re-create them. This must inevitably come to pass because it is one of the things that Allah has promised, and He does not break His promise. He is able to do that. Because He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ İóÜÚöáöíäó</div><br>  (Truly, We shall do it.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: "The Messenger of Allah stood among us exhorting us, and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóßõãú ãóÍúÔõæÑõæäó Åöáóì Çááåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó ÍõİóÇÉğ ÚõÑóÇÉğ ÛõÑúáğÇ¡ ßóãóÇ ÈóÏóÃúäóÇ Ãóæøóáó ÎóáúŞò äõÚöíÏõåõ æóÚúÏğÇ ÚóáóíúäóÇ¡ ÅöäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ İóÇÚöáöíä»</div><br>  (You will be gathered before Allah barefoot, naked and uncircumcised. As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it.) And he mentioned the entire Hadith. It was also recorded in the Two Sahihs, and Al-Bukhari mentioned it in his Tafsir of this Ayah.  </div></body></html>
