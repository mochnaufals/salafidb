Then if a person has any unsuitable thoughts about them, insinuated into his mind and imagination by Shaytan, he should not speak about that, for the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì ÊóÌóÇæóÒó áöÃõãøóÊöí ÚóãøóÇ ÍóÏøóËóÊú Èöåö ÃóäúİõÓõåóÇ ãóÇ áóãú ÊóŞõáú Ãóæú ÊóÚúãóáú»</div><br>  (Allah will excuse my Ummah for anything that occurs to their minds, so long as they do not speak about it or act upon it.) This was reported in the Two Sahihs. Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæúáÇ ÅöĞú ÓóãöÚúÊõãõæåõ ŞõáúÊõãú ãøóÇ íóßõæäõ áóäóÂ Ãóä äøóÊóßóáøóãó ÈöåóÜĞóÇ</div><br>  (And why did you not, when you heard it, say: "It is not right for us to speak of this''.) meaning, we should not talk about it or mention it to anyone.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓõÈúÍóÜäóßó åóÜĞóÇ ÈõåúÊóÜäñ ÚóÙöíãñ</div><br>  (Glory be to You (O Allah)! This is a great lie.) means, glory be to Allah that such a thing should be said about the wife of His Prophet and close Friend . Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚöÙõßõãõ Çááøóåõ Ãóä ÊóÚõæÏõæÇú áöãöËúáöåö ÃóÈóÏÇğ</div><br>  (Allah forbids you from it and warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, ) meaning, Allah is forbidding you and warning you from doing anything like this again in the future. Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ßõäÊõã ãøõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  (if you are believers.) meaning, if you believe in Allah and His Laws, and you respect His Messenger . As for those who are described as disbelievers, a different ruling applies in their case. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÈóíøöäõ Çááøóåõ áóßõãõ ÇáÇøñíóÜÊö</div><br>  (And Allah makes the Ayat plain to you,) meaning, He makes clear to you the rulings of Shari`ah and His divine decrees.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ Úóáöíãñ Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.) means, He knows what is right for His servants and He is Wise in His Laws and decrees.  </div></body></html>
