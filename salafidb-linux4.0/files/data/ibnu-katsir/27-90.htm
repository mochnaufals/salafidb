The Sur, as described in the Hadith, is,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÑúäñ íõäúİóÎõ İöíå»</div><br>  (a horn which is blown into.) According to the Hadith about the Sur (Trumpet), it is (the angel) Israfil who will blow into it by the command of Allah, may He be exalted. He will blow into it for the first time, for a long time. This will signal the end of the life of this world, and the Hour will come upon the most evil of people ever to live. Everyone who is in the heavens and on earth will be terrified,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóä ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (except him whom Allah wills.) these are the martyrs, for they are alive, with their Lord, and being provided for. Imam Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said that a man came to him and said, "What is this Hadith that you are narrating, that the Hour will come upon such and such people'' He said, "Subhan Allah or `La Ilaha Illallah (or something similar), I had decided that I would not narrate anything to anyone now. I had only said that after a little while, you will see a major event which will destroy the House the Ka`bah, and such and such will happen.'' Then he said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÎúÑõÌõ ÇáÏøóÌøóÇáõ İöí ÃõãøóÊöí İóíóãúßõËõ ÃóÑúÈóÚöíäó áóÇ ÃóÏúÑöí ÃóÑúÈóÚöíäó íóæúãğÇ Ãóæú ÃóÑúÈóÚöíäó ÔóåúÑğÇ Ãóæú ÃóÑúÈóÚöíäó ÚóÇãğÇ İóíóÈúÚóËõ Çááåõ ÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäó ãóÑúíóãó ßóÃóäøóåõ ÚõÑúæóÉõ Èúäõ ãóÓúÚõæÏò İóíóØúáõÈõåõ İóíõåúáößõåõ¡ Ëõãøó íóãúßõËõ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÓóÈúÚó Óöäöíäó áóíúÓó Èóíúäó ÇËúäóíúäö ÚóÏóÇæóÉñ¡ Ëõãøó íõÑúÓöáõ Çááåõ ÑöíÍğÇ ÈóÇÑöÏóÉğ ãöäú ŞöÈóáö ÇáÔøóÇãö¡ İóáóÇ íóÈúŞóì Úóáóì æóÌúåö ÇáúÃóÑúÖö ÃóÍóÏñ İöí ŞóáúÈöåö ãöËúŞóÇáõ ĞóÑøóÉò ãöäú ÎóíúÑò Ãóæú ÅöíãóÇäò ÅöáøóÇ ŞóÈóÖóÊúåõ¡ ÍóÊøóì áóæú Ãóäøó ÃóÍóÏóßõãú ÏóÎóáó İí ßóÈöÏö ÌóÈóáò áóÏóÎóáóÊúåõ Úóáóíúåö ÍóÊøóì ÊóŞúÈöÖóå»</div><br>  (The Dajjal will emerge in my Ummah, and will remain for forty -- I do not know whether he said forty days, or forty months, or forty years -- then Allah will send `Isa son of Maryam, who looks like `Urwah bin Mas`ud, and he will search for him and destroy him. Then mankind will remain for seven years during which there will not be any enmity between any two people. Then Allah will send a cool wind from the direction of Syria, and no one will be left on the face of the earth who has even a speck of goodness or faith in his heart, but it will take him.

They will not recognize anything good or denounce anything evil. The Shaytan will appear to them and will say, "Will you do as I tell you'' They will say, "What do you command us to do'' He will command them to worship idols but in spite of this their provision will be plentiful and they will lead comfortable lives. Then the Sur (Trumpet) will be blown, and no one will hear it but he will tilt his head to hear the sound. The first person to hear it will be a man who is setting up the tank for watering his camels. He will fall down, and all the other people will also fall down. Then Allah will send -- or send down -- rain like dew -- or he said, like shade (Nu'man was the one who was not sure) -- from which will grow the bodies of the people. Then the Trumpet will be blown again, and they will get up and look around. Then it will be said: "O mankind! Go to your Lord!'' And they will be stopped, for they are to be questioned. Then it will be said: "Bring forth the people who are to be sent to the Fire.'' It will be asked: "How many are they'' It will be said, "Out of every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine.''

That is the blast of the Sur which will terrify everyone, then after that will come the blast which will cause them to die, then the blast which will resurrect them to meet the Lord of the worlds -- this is when all of the creation will be brought forth from their graves. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõáøñ ÃóÊóæúåõ ÏóÎöÑöíäó</div><br>  (And all shall come to Him, humbled.) meaning, humbling themselves and obeying Him, and no one will go against His command.

According to the Hadith about the Sur, when it is blown for the third time, Allah will command the souls to be put into the hole of the Sur (Trumpet), then Israfil will blow into it, after the bodies have grown in their graves and resting places, and when he blows into the Sur (Trumpet), the souls will fly, the believers' souls glowing with light, and the disbelievers' souls looking like darkness. And Allah will say: "By My might and majesty, every soul will go back to its body.'' And the souls will come back to their bodies and go through them like poison going through a person who is bitten or stung by a poisonous creature. Then they will get up, brushing off the dirt of their graves.
