Do not envy what they have in this world, and do not upset yourself with regret for their rejection of you and their opposition to your religion.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÎúİöÖú ÌóäóÇÍóßó áöãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚóßó ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (And lower your wings to the believers who follow you) (26:215) meaning - be gentle with them, like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßõãú ÑóÓõæáñ ãøöäú ÃóäİõÓößõãú ÚóÒöíÒñ Úóáóíúåö ãóÇ ÚóäöÊøõãú ÍóÑöíÕñ Úóáóíúßõãú ÈöÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÑóÁõæİñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from among yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is anxious for you, for the believers - he is full of pity, kind and merciful)(9:128). There were some differences among the scholars over the meaning of "seven of the Mathani''. Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and others said that they are the seven long (Surahs), meaning Al-Baqarah, Al- `Imran, An-Nisa', Al-Ma'idah, Al-An`am, Al-A`raf and Yunus. There are texts to this effect reported from Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr. Sa`id said: "In them, Allah explains the obligations, the Hudud (legal limits), stories and rulings.'' Ibn `Abbas said, "He explains the parables, stories and lessons.'' The second opinion is that they (the seven of the Mathani) are Al-Fatihah, which is composed of seven Ayat. This was reported from `Ali, `Umar, Ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas. Ibn `Abbas said: "The Bismillah, is completing seven Ayah, which Allah has given exclusively to you (Muslims).'' This is also the opinion of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Abdullah bin `Umayr, Ibn Abi Mulaykah, Shahr bin Hawshab, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Mujahid.  Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded two Hadiths on this topic. (The first) was recorded from Abu Sa`id bin Al-Mu`alla, who said: "The Prophet passed by me while I was praying. He called out for me but I did not come until I finished my prayer. Then I came to him, and He asked,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãóäóÚóßó Ãóäú ÊóÃúÊöíóäöí¿»</div><br>  (What stopped you from coming to me) I said, `I was praying'. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóáóãú íóŞõáö Çááåõ (`Did not Allah say</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÇÓúÊóÌöíÈõæÇú áöáøóåö æóáöáÑøóÓõæáö ÅöĞóÇ ÏóÚóÇßõãú</div><br>  (O you who believe!

(The second Hadith) was reported from Abu Hurayrah who said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãõãøõ ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö åöíó ÇáÓøóÈúÚõ ÇáúãóËóÇäöí æóÇáúŞõÑúÂäõ ÇáúÚóÙöíã»</div><br>  (Umm Al-Qur'an (the Mother or the Essence of the Qur'an,) is the seven Mathani, and the Grand Qur'an.) This means that Al-Fatihah is the seven Mathani and the Grand Qur'an, but this does not contradict the statement that the seven Mathani are the seven long Surahs, because they also share these attributes, as does the whole Qur'an.
