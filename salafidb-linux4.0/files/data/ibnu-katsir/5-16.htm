Allah also states that He sent Muhammad with clear evidences and the distinction between truth and falsehood.

So the Prophet explained where they altered, distorted, changed and lied about Allah. He also ignored much of what they changed, since it would not bring about any benefit if it was explained. In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "He who disbelieves in stoning (the adulterer to death) will have inadvertently disbelieved in the Qur'an, for Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóåúáó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö ŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßõãú ÑóÓõæáõäóÇ íõÈóíøöäõ áóßõãú ßóËöíÑÇğ ãøöãøóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊõÎúİõæäó ãöäó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö</div><br>  (O People of the Scripture!

Al-Hakim said, "Its chain is Sahih, and they did not record it.'' Allah next mentions the Glorious Qur'an that He sent down to His honorable Prophet ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßõãú ãøöäó Çááøóåö äõæÑñ æóßöÊóÜÈñ ãøõÈöíäñíóåúÏöì Èöåö Çááøóåõ ãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚó ÑöÖúæóÇäóåõ ÓõÈõáó ÇáÓøóáóÜãö</div><br>  (Indeed, there has come to you from Allah a light and a plain Book.

He thus saves them from destruction and explains to them the best, most clear path. Therefore, He protects them from what they fear, and brings about the best of what they long for, all the while ridding them of misguidance and directing them to the best, most righteous state of being.  </div></body></html>
