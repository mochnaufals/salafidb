He disowned his father's and his people's worship of idols and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ŞóÇáó ÅöÈúÑóåöíãõ áÇøğÈöíåö æóŞóæúãöåö Åöäøóäöì ÈóÑóÂÁñ ãøöãøóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó - ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöì İóØóÑóäöì İóÅöäøóåõ ÓóíóåúÏöíäö æóÌóÚóáóåóÇ ßóáöãóÉğ ÈóÜŞöíóÉğ İöì ÚóŞöÈöåö</div><br>  ("Verily, I am innocent of what you worship, except Him Who created me; and verily, He will guide me.'' And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) The Word means the worship of Allah Alone with no partner or associate, and the denunciation of all gods apart from Him, i.e., La ilaha illallah. He left this word as an example to be followed by those of his progeny who were guided by Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóåõãú íóÑúÌöÚõæäó</div><br>  (that they may turn back.) means, come back to this word. `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others commented on the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáóåóÇ ßóáöãóÉğ ÈóÜŞöíóÉğ İöì ÚóŞöÈöåö</div><br>  (And he made it a Word lasting among his offspring,) "This means, La ilaha illallah, and there are still those among his offspring who say it.'' A similar view was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Ibn Zayd said, "The word of Islam,'' which refers to the same thing suggested by the group. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>How the People of Makkah turned away from the Messenger and opposed Him, and His Response</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah further says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ãóÊøóÚúÊõ åóÜÄõáÇóÁö</div><br>  (Nay, but I gave to these) means, the idolators,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÈóÂÁóåõãú</div><br>  (and their fathers) means, they lived a long life in their misguidance.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÌóÂÁóåõãõ ÇáúÍóŞøõ æóÑóÓõæáñ ãøõÈöíäñ</div><br>  (till there came to them the truth, and a Messenger making things clear.) means, his message is clear and his warning is clear.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõãõ ÇáúÍóŞøõ ŞóÇáõæÇú åóÜĞóÇ ÓöÍúÑñ æóÅöäøóÇ Èöåö ßóÜİöÑõæäó </div><br>  (And when the truth came to them, they said: "This is magic, and we disbelieve therein.'') means, they were arrogant and stubborn, and they pushed him away out of disbelief, envy and transgression.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú</div><br>  (And they say) means, objecting to that which Allah has revealed to him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæúáÇó äõÒøöáó åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäõ Úóáóì ÑóÌõáò ãøöäó ÇáúŞóÑúíóÊóíúäö ÚóÙöíãò</div><br>  (Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns) meaning, why was this Qur'an not revealed to some man who was great and prominent in their eyes, from the two towns, i.e., Makkah and At-Ta'if This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd. Several scholars of Tafsir stated that by this, the Quraysh meant Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah and `Urwah bin Mas`ud Ath-Thaqafi. The apparent meaning is that what they meant was a great man from either of the two towns. Allah responded to their rejection by saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóåõãú íóŞúÓöãõæäó ÑóÍúãóÉó ÑóÈøößó</div><br>  (Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) meaning, the matter has nothing to do with them; it is for Allah to decide. Allah knows best where to direct His Message, and He does not reveal it except to the one who is the purest in heart and soul, and of the noblest descent. Then Allah points out that He differentiates among His creation in terms of what He gives them of wealth, provision, intellect, understanding and other visible and hidden strengths:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÍúäõ ŞóÓóãúäóÇ Èóíúäóåõãú ãøóÚöíÔóÊóåõãú İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ</div><br>  (It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world,)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíóÊøóÎöĞó ÈóÚúÖõåõã ÈóÚúÖÇğ ÓõÎúÑöíøÇğ</div><br>  (so that some may employ others in their work.) It was said that this means that some employ others in their work, because one needs the other, and vice versa. This was the view of As-Suddi and others.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÍúãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó ÎóíúÑñ ãøöãøóÇ íóÌúãóÚõæäó</div><br>  (But the mercy of your Lord is better than which they amass.) means, the mercy of Allah towards His creation is better for them than the wealth and conveniences of this world which they possess. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Wealth is not a Sign of Divine Pleasure</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæúáÇó Ãóä íóßõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÃõãøóÉğ æóÍöÏóÉğ</div><br>  (And were it not that mankind would have become of one community,) means, `were it not for the fact that many ignorant people would think that Our giving them wealth was a sign that We love the person to whom We give it, and thus they would have agreed upon disbelief for the sake of wealth.' This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóÌóÚóáúäóÇ áöãóä íóßúİõÑõ ÈöÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö áöÈõíõæÊöåöãú ÓõŞõİÇğ ãøöä İöÖøóÉò æóãóÚóÇÑöÌó</div><br>  (We would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious, silver roofs for their houses, and elevators) means, ladders and staircases of silver. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Zayd and others.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóáóíúåóÇ íóÙúåóÑõæäó</div><br>  (whereby they ascend,) means, go up.

This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ßõáøõ Ğóáößó áóãøóÇ ãóÊóÜÚõ ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ</div><br>  (Yet all this would have been nothing but an enjoyment of this world.) means, all that belongs to this transient world which is insignificant before Allah. He hastens their reward for good deeds in the form of luxuries in this world, so that when they reach the Hereafter, they will have no good merits with Allah for which they may be rewarded, as was reported in the Sahih Hadith. It was reported in another Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú Ãóäøó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÊóÒöäõ ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ÌóäóÇÍó ÈóÚõæÖóÉò ãóÇ ÓóŞóì ãöäúåóÇ ßóÇİöÑğÇ ÔóÑúÈóÉó ãóÇÁ»</div><br>  (If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not give a disbeliever a drink of water.) Al-Baghawi narrated its chain of narration.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉõ ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøößó áöáúãõÊøóŞöíäó</div><br>  (And the Hereafter with your Lord is (only) for those who have Taqwa.) means, it is exclusively for them, and no one else will share it with them. When `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, visited the Messenger of Allah in seclusion, when he was keeping away from his wives, and he saw him resting on a rough mat which had left marks on his side, his eyes filled with tears and he said, "O Messenger of Allah, look at this Chosroes and this Caesar with all that they have, and you are the best of Allah's creation. '' The Messenger of Allah was reclining, but he sat up and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóæó İöí Ôóßó ÃóäúÊó íóÇ ÇÈúäó ÇáúÎóØøóÇÈö¿»</div><br>  (Are you in doubt, O son of Al-Khattab) Then he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃõæáÆößó Şóæúãñ ÚõÌøöáóÊú áóåõãú ØóÜíøöÜÈóÇÊõåõãú İöí ÍóíóÇÊöåöãõ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ»</div><br>  (Those are people for whom the enjoyments are hastened in this world.) According to another report:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãóÇ ÊóÑúÖóì Ãóäú ÊóÜÜßõæäó áóåõãõ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóáóäóÇ ÇáúÇÎöÑóÉ»</div><br>  (Does it not please you that this world is for them and the Hereafter is for us) In as the Two Sahihs and elsewhere, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÔúÑóÈõæÇ İöí ÂäöíóÉö ÇáĞøóåóÈö æóÇáúİöÖøóÉö¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÃúßõáõæÇ İöí ÕöÍóÇİöåóÇ¡ İóÅöäøóåóÇ áóåõãú İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóáóäóÇ İöí ÇáúÇÎöÑóÉ»</div><br>  (Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates of the same, for these things are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.) Allah has granted these things to them in this world because it is insignificant, as was reported by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah via Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa`d, who said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú ßóÇäóÊö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÊóÒöäõ ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ÌóäóÇÍó ÈóÚõæÖóÉò ãóÇ ÓóŞóì ãöäúåóÇ ßóÇİöÑğÇ ÔóÑúÈóÉó ãóÇÁò ÃóÈóÏğÇ»</div><br>  n(If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would never give a disbeliever a drink of water.)''
