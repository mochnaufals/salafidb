This water is sweet and palatable for whoever wants to drink it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóÜĞóÇ ãöáúÍñ ÃõÌóÇÌñ</div><br>  and that is salty and bitter. means, unpalatable. This is the ocean in which the big ships sail, and is salty and undrinkable. Alla0h says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóÜĞóÇ ãöáúÍñ ÃõÌóÇÌñ</div><br>  (and that is salty and bittery.) Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ßõáøò ÊóÃúßõáõæäó áóÍúãÇğ ØóÑöíøÇğ</div><br>  (And from them both you eat fresh tender meat,) meaning, fish.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÓúÊóÎúÑöÌõæäó ÍöáúíóÉğ ÊóáúÈóÓõæäóåóÇ</div><br>  (and derive the ornaments that you wear.)
