Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Anas said that one day, when the sun was about to set, the Messenger of Allah gave a speech to his Companions, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö ãóÇ ÈóŞöíó ãöäó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ İöíãóÇ ãóÖóì ãöäúåóÇ ÅöáøóÇ ßóãóÇ ÈóŞöíó ãöäú íóæúãößõãú åĞóÇ İöíãóÇ ãóÖóì ãöäúå»</div><br>  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! Not much of this world is left compared to what has already passed of it, except as much as what is left in this day of yours compared to what has already passed of it.) Anas said, "We could only see a small part of the setting sun at the time.'' Another Hadith that supports and explains the above Hadith is recorded by Imam Ahmad that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, "We were sitting with the Prophet while the sun was rising above Qu`ayqa`an, after `Asr. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÃóÚúãóÇÑõßõãú İöí ÃóÚúãóÇÑö ãóäú ãóÖóì ÅöáøóÇ ßóãóÇ ÈóŞöíó ãöäó ÇáäøóåóÇÑö İöíãóÇ ãóÖóì»</div><br>  (What remains of your time, compared to what has passed, is as long as what remains of this day compared to what has passed of it.)'' Imam Ahmad recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈõÚöËúÊõ ÃóäóÇ æóÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ åßóĞóÇ»</div><br>  (I was sent like this with the Last Hour.) and he pointed with his middle and index finger. The Two Sahihs also recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Wahb As-Suwa'i said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈõÚöËúÊõ ÃóäóÇ æóÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ßóåĞöåö ãöäú åĞöåö¡ Åöäú ßóÇÏóÊú áóÊóÓúÈöŞõäöí»</div><br>  (I was sent just before the Last Hour, like the distance between this and this; the latter almost overtook the former.) Al-A`mash joined between his index and middle fingers while narrating this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Awza`i said that Isma`il bin `Ubaydullah said, "Anas bin Malik went to Al-Walid bin `Abdul-Malik who asked him about what he heard from the Messenger of Allah about the Last Hour. Anas said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÊõãú æóÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ßóåóÇÊóíúä»</div><br>  (You and the Last Hour are as close as these two (fingers).)''' Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith. There is proof to support these Hadiths in the Sahih listing, Al-Hashir (literally the Gatherer), among the names of the Messenger of Allah ; he is the first to be gathered, and all people will be gathered thereafter (for the Day of Judgement). Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇäÔóŞøó ÇáúŞóãóÑõ</div><br>  (and the moon has been cleft asunder.) It occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger , according to the authentic Mutawatir Hadiths the scholars agree that the moon was cleft asunder during the lifetime of the Prophet, and it was among the clear miracles that Allah gave him. Hadiths mentioning that the Moon was split <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Narration of Anas bin Malik</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, "The people of Makkah asked the Prophet for a miracle and the moon was split into two parts in Makkah. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÊóÑóÈóÊö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ æóÇäÔóŞøó ÇáúŞóãóÑõ </div><br>  (The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.)'' Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said, "The people of Makkah asked the Messenger of Allah to produce a miracle, and he showed them the splitting of the moon into two parts, until they saw (the mount of) Hira' between them.'' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs with various chains of narration. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Narration of Jubayr bin Mut`im</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, "The moon was split into two pieces during the time of Allah's Prophet ; a part of the moon was over one mountain and another part over another mountain. So they said, `Muhammad has taken us by his magic.' They then said, `If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.''' Only Imam Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bayhaqi used another chain of narration in a similar Hadith he collected in Ad-Dala'il. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Narration of `Abdullah bin `Abbas</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "The moon was split during the time of the Prophet .'' Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÊóÑóÈóÊö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ æóÇäÔóŞøó ÇáúŞóãóÑõ - æóÅöä íóÑóæúÇú ÁóÇíóÉğ íõÚúÑöÖõæÇú æóíóŞõæáõæÇú ÓöÍúÑñ ãøõÓúÊóãöÑøñ </div><br>  (The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away and say: "This is magic, Mustamir.'') "This occurred before the Hijrah; the moon was split and they saw it in two parts.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Narration of `Abdullah bin `Umar Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Al-Bayhaqi recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar commented on Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÊóÑóÈóÊö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ æóÇäÔóŞøó ÇáúŞóãóÑõ </div><br>  (The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.) "This occurred during the time of Allah's Messenger ; the moon was split in two parts. A part of it was before the mount and a part on the other side. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó ÇÔúåóÏ»</div><br>  (O Allah! Be witness.)'' This is the narration that Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Narration of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, "The moon was split in two parts during the time of Allah's Messenger, and they saw its two parts. Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÔúåóÏõæÇ»</div><br>  (Be witnesses.)'' Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) said, "I saw the mountain between the two parts of the moon when it was split.'' Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said, "The moon was split during the time of Allah's Messenger and I saw the mount between its two parts. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Stubbornness of the idolators</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä íóÑóæúÇú ÁóÇíóÉğ</div><br>  (And if they see an Ayah), if they see proof, evidence and a sign,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÚúÑöÖõæÇú</div><br>  (they turn away), they do not believe in it. Rather, they turn away from it, abandoning it behind their backs,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæÇú ÓöÍúÑñ ãøõÓúÊóãöÑøñ</div><br>  (and say: "This is magic, Mustamir.'') They say, `the sign that we saw was magic, which was cast on us.' Mustamir, means, `will soon go away', according to Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. The Quraysh said that the cleaving of the moon was false and will soon diminish and fade away,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞøóÈõæÇú æóÇÊøóÈóÚõæÇú ÃóåúæóÂÁóåõãú</div><br>  (They denied and followed their own lusts.), they rejected the truth when it came to them, following the ignorance and foolishness that their lusts and desires called them to. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõáøõ ÃóãúÑò ãøõÓúÊóŞöÑøñ</div><br>  (And every matter will be settled.) means, the good deeds will take their doers to all that is good and righteous, and similarly evil deeds will take their doers to all that is evil, according to Qatadah, while Ibn Jurayj said, "will settle according to its people.'' Mujahid commented on the meaning of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõáøõ ÃóãúÑò ãøõÓúÊóŞöÑøñ</div><br>  (And every matter will be settled.) by saying, "On the Day of Resurrection.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóåõã ãøöäó ÇáÇøñäÈóÂÁö</div><br>  (And indeed there has come to them news); in this Qur'an, there has come to them the news of the earlier nations that disbelieved in their Messengers and the torment, punishment and affliction that befell them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ İöíåö ãõÒúÏóÌóÑñ</div><br>  (wherein there is Muzdajar), wherein there are warnings and lessons to stop them from idolatry and persisting in denial,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍößúãóÉñ ÈóÜáöÛóÉñ</div><br>  (Perfect wisdom,) in that Allah guides whomever He wills and misguides whomever He wills,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ÊõÛúäöÜì ÇáäøõĞõÑõ</div><br>  (but warners benefit them not.) but the preaching of warnings does not benefit those upon whom Allah has written misery and sealed their hearts.
