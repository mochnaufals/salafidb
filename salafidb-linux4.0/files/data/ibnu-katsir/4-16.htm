Ibn `Abbas said, "The early ruling was confinement, until Allah sent down Surat An-Nur (chapter 24) which abrogated that ruling with the ruling of flogging (for fornication) or stoning to death (for adultery).'' Similar was reported from `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Abu Salih, Qatadah, Zayd bin Aslam and Ad-Dahhak, and this is a matter that is agreed upon. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said, "When the revelation descended upon the Messenger of Allah , it would affect him and his face would show signs of strain. One day, Allah sent down a revelation to him, and when the Messenger was relieved of its strain, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÎõĞõæÇ Úóäøöí¡ ŞóÏú ÌóÚóáó Çááåõ áóåõäøó ÓóÈöíáğÇ¡ ÇáËøóíøöÈõ ÈöÇáËøóíøöÈö¡ æóÇáúÈößúÑõ ÈöÇáúÈößúÑö¡ ÇáËøóÜÜíøöÈõ ÌóáúÏõ ãöÇÆóÉò¡ æóÑóÌúãñ ÈöÇáúÍöÌóÇÑóÉö¡ æóÇáúÈößúÑõ ÌóáúÏõ ãöÇÆóÉò Ëõãøó äóİúíõ ÓóäóÉ»</div><br>  (Take from me: Allah has made some other way for them.

Muslim and the collectors of the Sunan recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÎõĞõæÇ Úóäøöí ÎõĞõæÇ Úóäøöí¡ ŞóÏú ÌóÚóáó Çááåõ áóåõäøó ÓóÈöíáğÇ¡ ÇáúÈößúÑõ ÈöÇáúÈößúÑö ÌóáúÏõ ãöÇÆóÉò æóÊóÛúÑöíÈõ ÚóÇãò¡ æóÇáËøóíøöÈõ ÈöÇáËøóíøöÈö ÌóáúÏõ ãöÇÆóÉò æóÇáÑøóÌúã»</div><br>  (Take from me, take from me.

Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr said that this punishment includes cursing, shaming them and beating them with sandals. This was the ruling until Allah abrogated it with flogging or stoning, as we stated. Mujahid said, "It was revealed about the case of two men who do it.'' As if he was referring to the actions of the people of Lut, and Allah knows best.  The collectors of Sunan recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÑóÃóíúÊõãõæåõ íóÚúãóáõ Úóãóáó Şóæúãö áõæØò¡ İóÇŞúÊõáõæÇ ÇáúİóÇÚöáó æóÇáúãóİúÚõæáó Èöå»</div><br>  (Whoever you catch committing the act of the people of Lut (homosexuality), then kill both parties to the act.)
