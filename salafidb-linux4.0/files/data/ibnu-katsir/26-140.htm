According to Ibn Mas`ud and according to `Abdullah bin `Abbas -- as reported from Al-`Awfi -- and `Alqamah and Mujahid, they meant, "What you have brought to us is nothing but the tales (Akhlaq) of the ancients.'' This is like what the idolators of Quraysh said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóÓóÜØöíÑõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó ÇßúÊóÊóÈóåóÇ İóåöìó Êõãúáóì Úóáóíúåö ÈõßúÑóÉğ æóÃóÕöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And they say: "Tales of the ancients, which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.'')

Some other scholars recited it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäú åóÜĞóÇ ÅöáÇøó ÎõáõŞõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó </div><br>  (This is no other than Khuluq of the ancients,) "as Khuluq,'' meaning their religion. What they were following was the religion of the ancients, their fathers and grandfathers, as if they were saying: "We are following them, we will live as they lived and die as they died, and there will be no resurrection and no judgement.'' Hence they said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ äóÍúäõ ÈöãõÚóĞøóÈöíäó </div><br>  (And we are not going to be punished.) Allah's saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóĞøóÈõæåõ İóÃóåúáóßúäóÜåõãú</div><br>  (So they denied him, and We destroyed them.) meaning, they continued to disbelieve and stubbornly oppose Allah's Prophet Hud, so Allah destroyed them. The means of their destruction has been described in more than one place in the Qur'an: Allah sent against them a strong and furious wind, i.e., a fiercely blowing wind that was intensely cold. Thus the means of their destruction was suited to their nature, for they were the strongest and fiercest of people, so Allah overpowered them with something that was even stronger and fiercer than them, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑó ßóíúİó İóÚóáó ÑóÈøõßó ÈöÚóÇÏò - ÅöÑóãó ĞóÇÊö ÇáúÚöãóÇÏö </div><br>  (Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with `Ad of Iram Possesors of the pillars) (89:6-7). This refers to the former `Ad, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõ Ãóåúáóßó ÚóÇÏÇğ ÇáÇøòæáóì </div><br>  (And that it is He Who destroyed the former `Ad) (53:50). They were descendents of Iram bin Sam bin Nuh,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ĞóÇÊö ÇáúÚöãóÇÏö</div><br>  (Possesors of the pillars) They used to live among pillars. Those who claim that Iram was a city take this idea from Isra'iliyyat narrations, from the words of Ka`b and Wahb, but there is no real basis for that. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóÊöì áóãú íõÎúáóŞú ãöËúáõåóÇ İöì ÇáúÈöáóÜÏö </div><br>  (The like of which were not created in the land) (89:8). meaning, nothing like this tribe was created in terms of might, power and tyranny. If what was meant was a city, it would have said, "The like of which was not built in the land.'' And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóãøóÇ ÚóÇÏñ İóÇÓúÊóßúÈóÑõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÈöÛóíúÑö ÇáúÍóŞøö æóŞóÇáõæÇú ãóäú ÃóÔóÏøõ ãöäøóÇ ŞõæøóÉğ Ãóæóáóãú íóÑóæúÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞóåõãú åõæó ÃóÔóÏøõ ãöäúåõãú ŞõæøóÉğ æóßóÇäõæÇú ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ íóÌúÍóÏõæäó </div><br>  (As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: "Who is mightier than us in strength'' See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them. And they used to deny Our Ayat!) (41:15) And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ÚóÇÏñ İóÃõåúáößõæÇú ÈöÑöíÍò ÕóÑúÕóÑò ÚóÇÊöíóÉò </div><br>  (And as for `Ad, they were destroyed by a furious violent wind!) until His saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍõÓõæãÇğ</div><br>  (in succession) (69:6-7) meaning, consecutively (i.e., seven nights and eight days).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóÑóì ÇáúŞóæúãó İöíåóÇ ÕóÑúÚóì ßóÃóäøóåõãú ÃóÚúÌóÇÒõ äóÎúáò ÎóÇæöíóÉò</div><br>  (so that you could see men lying overthrown (destroyed), as if they were hollow trunks of date palms!) (69:7) means, they were left as headless bodies, because the wind would come and carry one of them, then drop him on his head, so that his brains were spilled out, his head was broken and he was thrown aside, as if they were uprooted stems of date-palms. They used to build fortresses in the mountains and caves, and they dug ditches half as deep as a man is tall, but that did not help them against the command of Allah at all.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÃóÌóáó Çááøóåö ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁó áÇó íõÄóÎøóÑõ</div><br>  (Verily, the term given by Allah, when it comes, cannot be delayed) (71:4). Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóĞøóÈõæåõ İóÃóåúáóßúäóÜåõãú</div><br>  (So they denied him, and We destroyed them.)  </div></body></html>
