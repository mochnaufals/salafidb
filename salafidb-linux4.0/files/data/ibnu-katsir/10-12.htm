When man suffers adversity he becomes worried and anxious. So he supplicates more. He prays to Allah to lift and remove the adversity. He prays while standing, sitting or laying down. When Allah removes his adversity and lifts his distress, he turns away and becomes arrogant. He goes on as if nothing were wrong with him before.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÑøó ßóÃóä áøóãú íóÏúÚõäóÂ Åöáóì ÖõÑøò ãøóÓøóåõ</div><br>  (He passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!)
