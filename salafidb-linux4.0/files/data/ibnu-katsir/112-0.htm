This means that there is none similar to Him, none equal to Him and there is nothing at all like Him.''  Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded it and At-Tirmidhi mentioned it as a Mursal narration. Then At-Tirmidhi said, "And this is the most correct.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>A Hadith on its Virtues</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Al-Bukhari reported from `Amrah bint `Abdur-Rahman, who used to stay in the apartment of `A'ishah, the wife of the Prophet , that `A'ishah said, "The Prophet sent a man as the commander of a war expedition and he used to lead his companions in prayer with recitation (of the Qur'an). And he would complete his recitation with the recitation of `Say: He is Allah, One.' So when they returned they mentioned that to the Prophet and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Óóáõæåõ áöÃóíøö ÔóíúÁò íóÕúäóÚõ Ğóáößó¿»</div><br>  (Ask him why does he do that.) So they asked him and he said, `Because it is the description of Ar-Rahman and I love to recite it. So the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÎúÈöÑõæåõ Ãóäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì íõÍöÈøõå»</div><br>  (Inform him that Allah the Most High loves him.)'' This is how Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in his Book of Tawhid. Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded it.  In his Book of Salah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas said, "A man from the Ansar used to lead the people in prayer in the Masjid of Quba'. Whenever he began a Surah in the recitation of the prayer that he was leading them, he would start by reciting `Say: He is Allah, One' until he completed the entire Surah.  Then he would recite another Surah along with it (after it). And used to do this in every Rak`ah. So his companions spoke to him about this saying; `Verily, you begin the prayer with this Surah. Then you think that it is not sufficient for you unless you recite another Surah as well. So you should either recite it or leave it and recite another Surah instead.'  The man replied, `I will not leave it off. If you want me to continue leading you (in prayer), I will do this; and if you all do not like it, I will leave you (i.e., I will stop leading you).' They used to consider him to be of the best of them to lead them in prayer and they did not want anyone else to lead them other than him. So, when the Prophet came they informed him of this information and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ İõáóÇäõ¡ ãóÇ íóãúäóÚõßó Ãóäú ÊóİúÚóáó ãóÇ íóÃúãõÑõßó Èöåö ÃóÕúÍóÇÈõßó¡ æóãóÇ Íóãóáóßó Úóáóì áõÒõæã åóĞöåö ÇáÓøõæÑóÉö İöí ßõáøö ÑóßúÚóÉò¿»</div><br>  (O so-and-so! What prevents you from doing what your companions are commanding you to do, and what makes you adhere to the recitation of this Surah in every Rak`ah) The man said, `Verily, I love it.' The Prophet replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÍõÈøõßó ÅöíøóÇåóÇ ÃóÏúÎóáóßó ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (Your love of it will cause you to enter Paradise.) This was recorded by Al-Bukhari, with a disconnected chain, but in a manner indicating his approval. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>A Hadith that mentions this Surah is equivalent to a Third of the Qur'an</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Sa`id that a man heard another man reciting   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó Çááøóåõ ÃóÍóÏñ </div><br>  (Say: "He is Allah, One.'') and he was repeating over and over. So when morning came, the man went to the Prophet and mentioned that to him, and it was as though he was belittling it. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö ÅöäøóåóÇ áóÊóÚúÏöáõ ËõáõËó ÇáúŞõÑúÂä»</div><br>  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul, verily it is equivalent to a third of the Qur'an.) Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded it. Another Hadith Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Sa`id, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah said to his Companions,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóíóÚúÌöÒõ ÃóÍóÏõßõãú Ãóäú íóŞúÑóÃó ËõáõËó ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö İöí áóíúáóÉò¿»</div><br>  (Is one of you not able to recite a third of the Qur'an in a single night) This was something that was difficult for them and they said, "Which of us is able to do that, O Messenger of Allah'' So he replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááåõ ÇáúæóÇÍöÏõ ÇáÕøóãóÏõ ËõáõËõ ÇáúŞõÑúÂä»</div><br>  ("Allah is the One, As-Samad'' is a third of the Qur'an.) Al-Bukhari was alone in recording this Hadith. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Hadith that its Recitation necessitates Admission into Paradise</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Malik bin Anas recorded from `Ubayd bin Hunayn that he heard Abu Hurayrah saying, "I went out with the Prophet and he heard a man reciting `Say: He is Allah, the One.' So the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÌóÈóÊ»</div><br>  (It is obligatory.) I asked, `What is obligatory' He replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (Paradise.)'' At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded it by way of Malik, and At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih Gharib. We do not know of it except as a narration of Malik.'' The Hadith in which the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÍõÈøõßó ÅöíøóÇåóÇ ÃóÏúÎóáóßó ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (Your love of it will cause you to enter Paradise.) has already been mentioned. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>A Hadith about repeating this Surah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  `Abdullah bin Imam Ahmad recorded from Mu`adh bin `Abdullah bin Khubayb, who reported that his father said, "We became thirsty and it had become dark while we were waiting for the Messenger of Allah to lead us in prayer. Then, when he came out he took me by my hand and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Şõá»</div><br>  (Say.) Then he was silent. Then he said again,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Şõá»</div><br>  (Say.) So I said, `What should I say' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó Çááøóåõ ÃóÍóÏñ </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõÚóæøöĞóÊóíúäö Íöíäó ÊõãúÓöí æóÍöíäó ÊõÕúÈöÍõ ËóáóÇËğÇ¡ Êóßúİößó ßõáøó íóæúãò ãóÑøóÊóíúä»</div><br>  (Say: "He is Allah, One,'' and the two Surahs of Refuge (Al-Falaq and An-Nas) when you enter upon the evening and the morning three times (each). They will be sufficient for you two times every day.)'' This Hadith was also recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih Gharib.'' An-Nasa'i also recorded through another chain of narrators with the wording,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóßúİößó ßõáøó ÔóíúÁ»</div><br>  (They will suffice you against everything.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Hadith about supplicating with it by Allah's Names</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  In his Book of Tafsir, An-Nasa'i recorded from `Abdullah bin Buraydah, who reported from his father that he entered the Masjid with the Messenger of Allah , and there was a man praying and supplicating saying, "O Allah! Verily, I ask you by my testifying that there is no God worthy of worship except You. You are the One, the Self-Sufficient Sustainer of all, Who does not give birth, nor were You born, and there is none comparable to Him.'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö áóŞóÏú ÓóÃóáóåõ ÈöÇÓúãöåö ÇáúÃóÚúÙóã¡ ÇáøóĞöí ÅöĞó</div><br> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>A Hadith about seeking a Cure by these Surahs</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah that whenever the Prophet would go to bed every night, he would put his palms together and blow into them. Then he would recite into them (his palms), `Say: He is Allah, One', `Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of Al-Falaq', and `Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind.' Then he would wipe whatever he was able to of his body with them (his palms). He would begin wiping his head and face with them and the front part of his body. He would do this (wiping his body) three times. The Sunan compilers also recorded this same Hadith.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÓúãö Çááøóåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö </div><br>  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  </div></body></html>
