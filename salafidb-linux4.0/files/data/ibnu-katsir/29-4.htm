This is a rebuke in the form of a question, meaning that Allah will inevitably test His believing servants according to their level of faith, as it recorded in the authentic Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÔóÏøõ ÇáäøóÇÓö ÈóáóÇÁğ ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁõ¡ Ëõãøó ÇáÕøóÇáöÍõæäó¡ Ëõãøó ÇáúÃóãúËóáõ İóÇáúÃóãúËóáõ¡ íõÈúÊóáóì ÇáÑøóÌõáõ Úóáóì ÍóÓóÈö Ïöíäöåö¡ İóÅöäú ßóÇäó İöí Ïöíäöåö ÕóáóÇÈóÉñ ÒöíÏó áóåõ İöí ÇáúÈóáóÇÁ»</div><br>  (The people most severly tested are the Prophets, then the righteous, then the next best and the next best.

And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÍóÓöÈúÊõãú Ãóä ÊóÏúÎõáõæÇú ÇáúÌóäøóÉó æóáóãøóÇ íóÃúÊößõã ãøóËóáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÎóáóæúÇú ãöä ŞóÈúáößõã ãøóÓøóÊúåõãõ ÇáúÈóÃúÓóÂÁõ æóÇáÖøóÑøóÂÁõ æóÒõáúÒöáõæÇú ÍóÊøóì íóŞõæáó ÇáÑøóÓõæáõ æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ãóÚóåõ ãóÊóì äóÕúÑõ Çááøóåö ÃóáÇó Åöäøó äóÕúÑó Çááøóåö ŞóÑöíÈñ </div><br>  (Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, "When (will come) the help of Allah'' Yes!

Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, knows what has happened in the past and what is yet to come, and He knows how that which will not happen would have happened if it were to happen. All the Imams of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah are agreed on this. This is the view of Ibn `Abbas and others concerning phrases such as the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó áöäóÚúáóãó</div><br>  (only that We know) (2:143). Meaning, only to see -- because seeing has to do with what is there, but knowledge is broader than seeing, since it includes what is not present as well as what is. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Evildoers cannot escape from Allah Allah said:</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÍóÓöÈó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÚúãóáõæäó ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÇÊö Ãóä íóÓúÈöŞõæäóÇ ÓóÂÁó ãóÇ íóÍúßõãõæäó </div><br>  (Or think those who do evil deeds that they can outstrip Us Evil is that which they judge!) means, those who are not believers should not think that they will escape such trials and tests, for ahead of them lies a greater and more severe punishment.
