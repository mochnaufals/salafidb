Next, Allah refutes the false accusations that the liars and sinners accused the Prophet of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞóßøöÑú İóãóÂ ÃóäÊó ÈöäöÚúãóÉö ÑóÈøößó ÈößóÜåöäò æóáÇó ãóÌúäõæäò </div><br>  (Therefore, remind. By the grace of Allah, you are neither a Kahin nor a madman.) Allah says, `by the grace of Allah, you, O Muhammad, are not a Kahin, as the ignorant Quraysh idolators claim.' A Kahin is the soothsayer who receives information from the Jinns that the Jinns are able to eavesdrop on news from heaven,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ãóÌúäõæäò</div><br>  (nor a madman) whom Shaytan has possessed with insanity. Allah the Exalted said, while chastising the pagans for uttering false statements about the Prophet ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú íóŞõæáõæäó ÔóÇÚöÑñ äøóÊóÑóÈøóÕõ Èöåö ÑóíúÈó Çáúãóäõæäö </div><br>  (Or do they say: "A poet! We await for him some calamity by time!'') They said, `We await a disaster to strike him, for example, death. We will be patient with him until death comes to him and we, thus, get rid of his bother and from his Message.' Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÊóÑóÈøóÕõæÇú İóÅöäøöì ãóÚóßõãú ãøöäó ÇáúãõÊóÑóÈøöÕöíäó </div><br>  (Say: "Wait! I am with you among those who wait!'') `wait and I too will wait with you, and you will come to know to whom the good end and triumph shall be granted in this life and the Hereafter.' Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that `Abdullah bin Abi Najih said that Mujahid said that Ibn `Abbas said, "When the Quraysh gathered in the Dar An-Nadwah (their meeting place) to discuss the matter of the Prophet, one of them said, `Jail him in chains. Then we will wait and in time, a calamity will strike him; he will die just as the poets before him died, such as Zuhayr and An-Nabighah, for he is a poet just like them.' Allah the Exalted said in response to their statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú íóŞõæáõæäó ÔóÇÚöÑñ äøóÊóÑóÈøóÕõ Èöåö ÑóíúÈó Çáúãóäõæäö </div><br>  (Or do they say: "A poet! We await for him some calamity by time!'')'' Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÊóÃúãõÑõåõãú ÃóÍúáóÜãõåõãú ÈöåóÜĞóÂ</div><br>  (Or do their minds command them this), `do their minds command them to tell these lies against you (O Muhammad), even though they know in their hearts that they are untrue and false,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú åõãú Şóæúãñ ØóÇÛõæäó</div><br>  (or are they people transgressing all bounds) `surely, they are misguided, stubborn and unjust people, and this is why they say what they say about you (O Muhammad). ' Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú íóŞõæáõæäó ÊóŞóæøóáóåõ</div><br>  (Or do they say: "He has forged it'') They said, `he has forged this Qur'an and brought it from his own.' Allah the Exalted responded to them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóá áÇøó íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (Nay! They believe not!), meaning, their disbelief drives them to utter these statements,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáúíóÃúÊõæÇú ÈöÍóÏöíËò ãøöËúáöåö Åöä ßóÇäõæÇú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó </div><br>  (Let them then produce a recitation like unto it if they are truthful.) meaning, if they are truthful in their statement that Muhammad has forged this Qur'an and brought it of his own, then let them produce something similar to what he has brought forth, as in this Qur'an! And even if they combine their strength to that of the people of the earth, Jinns and mankind alike, they will never produce something like the Qur'an, or ten Surahs like it, or even one Surah!  </div></body></html>
