I do not ask such things of my Lord. I only follow what He reveals and commands me. Therefore, if Allah sends a miracle, I will accept it. Otherwise, I will not ask for it unless He allows me. Certainly, Allah is Most Wise, the All-Knower. Allah next directs the servants to the fact that this Qur'an is the most powerful miracle, clearest evidence and most true proof and explanation, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ ÈóÕóÂÆöÑõ ãöä ÑøóÈøößõãú æóåõÏğì æóÑóÍúãóÉğ áøöŞóæúãò íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (This (the Qur'an) is nothing but evidences from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.)  </div></body></html>
