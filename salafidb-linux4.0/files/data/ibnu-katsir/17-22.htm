Imam Ahmad reported that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said: "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóÕóÇÈóÊúåõ İóÇŞóÉñ İóÃóäúÒóáóåóÇ ÈöÇáäøóÇÓö áóãú ÊõÓóÏøó İóÇŞóÊõåõ¡ æóãóäú ÃóäúÒóáóåóÇ ÈöÇááåö ÃóÑúÓóáó Çááåõ áóåõ ÈöÇáúÛöäóì ÅöãøóÇ ÂÌöáğÇ æóÅöãøóÇ Ûöäìğ ÚóÇÌöáğÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever is afflicted with poverty and goes and asks people for help, will never get rid of his poverty, but if he asks Allah for help, then Allah will grant him the means of independence sooner or later.) This was also recorded by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who said, "Hasan Sahih Gharib''.  </div></body></html>
