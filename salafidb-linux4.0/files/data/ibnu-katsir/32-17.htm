Their leader in this world and the Hereafter is the Messenger of Allah . Imam Ahmad recorded that Mu`adh bin Jabal said, "I was with the Messenger of Allah on a journey one morning, walking near him. I said, `O Prophet of Allah, tell me of a deed that will grant me admittance to Paradise and keep me away from Hell.' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóŞóÏú ÓóÃóáúÊó Úóäú ÚóÙöíãò æóÅöäøóåó áóíóÓöíÑñ Úóáóì ãóäú íóÓøóÑóåõ Çááåõ Úóáóíúåö¡ ÊóÚúÈõÏõ Çááåó æóáóÇ ÊõÔúÑößõ Èöåö ÔóíúÆğÇ¡ æóÊõŞöíãõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó æóÊõÄúÊöí ÇáÒøóßóÇÉó¡ æóÊóÕõæãõ ÑóãóÖóÇäó¡ æóÊóÍõÌøõ ÇáúÈóíúÊ»</div><br>  (You have asked about something great, and it is easy for the one for whom Allah makes it easy.

Will the people be thrown into Hell -- (or he said) on their faces -- except because of what their tongues say) It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah in their Sunans. At-Tirmidhi said, "It is Hasan Sahih.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóÚúáóãõ äóİúÓñ ãøóÂ ÃõÎúİöìó áóåõã ãøöä ŞõÑøóÉö ÃóÚúíõäò</div><br>  (No person knows what is kept hidden for them of delights of eyes) means, no one knows the vastness of what Allah has concealed for them of everlasting joy in Paradise and delights such as no one has ever seen. Because they conceal their good deeds, Allah conceals the reward for them, a fitting reward which will suit their deeds. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "If people conceal their good deeds, Allah will conceal for them what no eye has seen and what has never crossed the mind of man. It was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Al-Bukhari quoted the Ayah: d   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóÚúáóãõ äóİúÓñ ãøóÂ ÃõÎúİöìó áóåõã ãøöä ŞõÑøóÉö ÃóÚúíõäò</div><br>  (No person knows what is kept hidden for them of delights of eyes) Then he recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÇáó Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáì: ÃóÚúÏóÏúÊõ áöÚöÈóÇÏöí ÇáÕøóÇáöÍöíäó ãóÇ áóÇ Úóíúäñ ÑóÃóÊú¡ æóáóÇ ÃõĞõäñ ÓóãöÚóÊú¡ æóáóÇ ÎóØóÑó Úóáì ŞóáúÈö ÈóÔóÑ»</div><br>  (Allah says: "I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and it has never crossed the mind of man.'') Abu Hurayrah said: "Recite, if you wish:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóÚúáóãõ äóİúÓñ ãøóÂ ÃõÎúİöìó áóåõã ãøöä ŞõÑøóÉö ÃóÚúíõäò</div><br>  (No person knows what is kept hidden for them of delights of eyes.) It was also recorded by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi. At-Tirmidhi said, "It is Hasan Sahih.''  In another version of Al-Bukhari:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóáóÇ ÎóØóÑó Úóáóì ŞóáúÈö ÈóÔóÑò¡ ĞõÎúÑğÇ ãöäú Èóáúåö ãóÇ ÃõØúáöÚúÊõãú Úóáóíúå»</div><br>  ("and no body has ever even imagined of. All that is reserved, besides which, all that you have seen is nothing.'') It was also reported from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú íóÏúÎõáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉó íóäúÚóãú áóÇ íóÈúÃóÓú¡ áóÇ ÊóÈúáóì ËöíóÇÈõåõ¡ æóáóÇ íóİúäóì ÔóÈóÇÈõåõ¡ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ãóÇ áóÇ Úóíúäñ ÑóÃóÊú¡ æóáóÇ ÃõĞõäñ ÓóãöÚóÊú¡ æóáóÇ ÎóØóÑó Úóáì ŞóáúÈö ÈóÔóÑ»</div><br>  (Whoever enters Paradise, will enjoy a life of luxury and never feel deprivation, his clothes will never wear out, his youth will never fade. In Paradise there is what no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and has never crossed the mind of man.) This was recorded by Muslim.  </div></body></html>
