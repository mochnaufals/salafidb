A parable has been made,) meaning, a parable of that which is worshipped by those who are ignorant of Allah and who join others as partners with Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÓúÊóãöÚõæÇú áóåõ</div><br>  (so listen to it) pay attention and understand.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóÏúÚõæäó ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö áóä íóÎúáõŞõæÇú ĞõÈóÇÈÇğ æóáóæö ÇÌúÊóãóÚõæÇú áóåõ</div><br>  (Verily, those on whom you call besides Allah, cannot create a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose.) Even if all the idols and false gods whom you worship were to come together to create a single fly, they would not be able to do that. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah recorded the Marfu` report:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóãóäú ÃóÙúáóãõ ãöãøóäú ÎóáóŞó (ÎóáúŞğÇ) ßóÎóáúŞöí¡ İóáúíóÎúáõŞõæÇ ãöËúáó ÎóáúŞöí ĞóÑøóÉğ Ãóæú ĞõÈóÇÈóÉğ Ãóæú ÍóÈøóÉ»</div><br>  ("Who does more wrong than one who tries to create something like My creation Let them create an ant or a fly or a seed like My creation!'') This was also recorded by the authors of the Two Sahihs via `Umarah from Abu Zur`ah from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Prophet said: a   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÇáó Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó æóãóäú ÃóÙúáóãõ ãöãøóäú ĞóåóÈó íóÎúáõŞõ ßóÎóáúŞöí¡ İóáúíóÎúáõŞõæÇ ĞóÑøóÉğ¡ İóáúíóÎúáõŞõæÇ ÔóÚöíÑóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah says: "Who does more wrong than one who tries to create (something) like My creation Let them create an ant, let them create a grain of barley.'') Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä íóÓúáõÈúåõãõ ÇáĞøõÈóÇÈõ ÔóíúÆÇğ áÇøó íóÓúÊóäŞöĞõæåõ ãöäúåõ</div><br>  (And if the fly snatches away a thing from them, they will have no power to release it from the fly.) They are unable to create a single fly and, moreover, they are unable to resist it or take revenge against it if it were to take anything from the good and perfumed thing on which it lands. If they wanted to recover that, they would not be able to, even though the fly is the weakest and most insignificant of Allah's creatures. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÖóÚõİó ÇáØøóÇáöÈõ æóÇáúãóØúáõæÈõ</div><br>  (So weak are the seeker and the sought.) Ibn `Abbas said, "The seeker is the idol and the sought is the fly.'' This was the view favored by Ibn Jarir, and it is what is apparent from the context. As-Suddi and others said, "The seeker is the worshipper, and the sought is the idol.'' Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ŞóÏóÑõæÇú Çááøóåó ÍóŞøó ŞóÏúÑöåö</div><br>  (They have not regarded Allah with His rightful esteem.) meaning, they have not recognized the might and power of Allah when they wor- ship alongside Him those who cannot even ward off a fly, because they are so weak and incapable.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó áóŞóæöìøñ ÚóÒöíÒñ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.) means, He is the All-Strong Who, by His might and power, created all things.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íóÈúÏóÃõ ÇáúÎóáúŞó Ëõãøó íõÚöíÏõåõ æóåõæó Ãóåúæóäõ Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him) 30:27   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÈóØúÔó ÑóÈøößó áóÔóÏöíÏñ - Åöäøóåõ åõæó íõÈúÏöìÁõ æóíõÚöíÏõ </div><br>  (Verily, the punishment of your Lord is severe and painful.
