(62. They assign to Allah that which they dislike (for themselves), and their tongues assert the lie that the better things will be theirs.

If He were to punish them for what they have done, there would be no living creature left on the face of the earth, i.e., He would have destroyed every animal on earth after destroying the sons of Adam. But the Lord - magnificent is His glory - is forbearing and He covers people's faults. He waits until the appointed time, i.e., He does not rush to punish them. If He did, then there would be no one left. Ibn Jarir reported that Abu Salamah said: "Abu Hurayrah heard a man saying, `The wrongdoer harms no one but himself.' He turned to him and said, `That is not true, by Allah! Even the buzzard dies in its nest because of the sins of the wrongdoer.''' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>They attribute to Allah what They Themselves dislike</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÌúÚóáõæäó áöáøóåö ãóÇ íóßúÑóåõæäó</div><br>  (They assign to Allah that which they dislike (for themselves),) meaning, daughters, and partners, who are merely His servants, yet none of them would like to have someone sharing in his wealth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÕöİõ ÃóáúÓöäóÊõåõãõ ÇáúßóĞöÈó Ãóäøó áóåõãõ ÇáúÍõÓúäóì</div><br>  (and their tongues assert the lie that the better things will be theirs.) This is a denunciation of their claims that better things will be theirs in this world, and in the Hereafter.

But if I am brought back to my Lord, then , with Him, there will surely be the best for me.'' Then, We will certainly show the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste severe torment.)

(19:77)  Allah tells us about one of the two men:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏóÎóáóÌóäøóÊóåõ æóåõæó ÙóÇáöãñ áøöäóİúÓöåö ŞóÇáó ãóÂ ÃóÙõäøõ Ãóä ÊóÈöíÏó åóÜĞöåö ÃóÈóÏÇğæóãóÂ ÃóÙõäøõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉó ŞóÇÆöãóÉğ æóáóÆöä ÑøõÏöÏÊøõ Åöáóì ÑóÈøöì áÃóÌöÏóäøó ÎóíúÑÇğ ãøöäúåóÇ ãõäúŞóáóÈÇğ </div><br>  (He went into his garden while wronging himself. He said: "I do not think that this will ever perish. And I do not think that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back to my Lord, (on the Day of Resurrection), then surely, I shall find better than this when I return to Him.'') (18:35-36) These people combined bad deeds with the false hopes of being rewarded with good for those bad deeds, which is impossible. Thus Allah refuted their false hopes, when He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÌóÑóãó</div><br>  (No doubt), meaning, truly it is inevitable that   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøó áóåõãõ ÇáúäøóÇÑó</div><br>  (for them is the Fire), meaning, on the Day of Resurrection.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõãú ãøõİúÑóØõæäó</div><br>  (and they will be forsaken). Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and others said: "This means they will be forgotten and neglected there.'' This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇáúíóæúãó äóäÓóÜåõãú ßóãóÇ äóÓõæÇú áöŞóÂÁó íóæúãöåöãú åóÜĞóÇ</div><br>  (So today We forget them just as they forgot meeting on this day of theirs.) (7:51). It was also reported from Qatadah that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõİúÑóØõæäó</div><br>  (they will be forsaken) means `they are hastened into the Fire.' There is no contradiction between the two, because they will be hastened into the Fire on the Day of Resurrection, then they will be forgotten there, i.e., left to dwell there for eternity.  </div></body></html>
