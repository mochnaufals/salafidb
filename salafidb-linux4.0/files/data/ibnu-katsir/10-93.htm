Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÈóæøóÃó ÕöÏúŞò</div><br>  (honorable dwelling place) means in Egypt and Syria, around Jerusalem, as it was said by some. When Allah destroyed Fir`awn and his soldiers, the Mosaic State took control of all of Egypt as Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóæúÑóËúäóÇ ÇáúŞóæúãó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóÇäõæÇú íõÓúÊóÖúÚóİõæäó ãóÔóÜÑöŞó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóãóÛóÜÑöÈóåóÇ ÇáøóÊöì ÈóÇÑóßúäóÇ İöíåóÇ æóÊóãøóÊú ßóáöãóÊõ ÑóÈøößó ÇáúÍõÓúäóì Úóáóì Èóäöì ÅöÓúÑÁöíáó ÈöãóÇ ÕóÈóÑõæÇú æóÏóãøóÑúäóÇ ãóÇ ßóÇäó íóÕúäóÚõ İöÑúÚóæúäõ æóŞóæúãõåõ æóãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúÑöÔõæäó </div><br>  (And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed. And the fair Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because of their endurance. And We destroyed completely all the great works and buildings which Fir`awn and his people erected.)(7:137) He said in other Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÎúÑóÌúäóÜåõãú ãøöä ÌóäøóÜÊò æóÚõíõæäò - æóßõäõæÒò æóãóŞóÇãò ßóÑöíãò - ßóĞóáößó æóÃóæúÑóËúäóÜåóÇ Èóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó </div><br>  (So, We expelled them from gardens and springs. Treasures, and every kind of honorable place. Thus, and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.)(26:57 -59) He also said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóãú ÊóÑóßõæÇú ãöä ÌóäøóÜÊò æóÚõíõæäò </div><br>  (How many of gardens and springs that they left behind. ..) (44:25-27) They then continued with Musa, to seek Jerusalem -- the land of Ibrahim, the friend of Allah. There were giant people in Jerusalem. The Children of Israel refrained from fighting them. So Allah expelled them into the wilderness for forty years. During this time in the wilderness, first Harun died and then Musa. Yusha` bin Nun led after them. Allah supported them to conquer Jerusalem and rule it for a period of time. His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÒóŞúäóÇåõãú ãøöäó ÇáØøóíøöÈóÇÊö</div><br>  (and provided them with good things) means from the lawful, pure and useful provision that is good in nature and in Law. Then Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇú ÍóÊøóì ÌóÂÁóåõãõ ÇáúÚöáúãõ</div><br>  (and they differed not until the knowledge came to them.) There should be no reason for them to have any disputes among them since Allah has sent them knowledge and explained different matters and issues to them. It has been mentioned in a Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáúíóåõæÏó ÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇ Úóáóì ÅöÍúÏóì æóÓóÈúÚöíäó İöÑúŞóÉğ¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáäøóÕóÇÑóì ÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇ Úóáóì ÇËúäóÊóíúäö æóÓóÈúÚöíäó İöÑúŞóÉğ¡ æóÓóÊóİúÊóÑöŞõ åóĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉõ Úóáóì ËóáóÇËò æóÓóÈúÚöíäó İöÑúŞóÉğ¡ ãöäúåóÇ æóÇÍöÏóÉñ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóÇËúäóÊóÇäö æóÓóÈúÚõæäó İöí ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (The Jews separated into seventy-one sects, and the Christians separated into seventy-two sects, and this Ummah will separate into seventy-three sects, one of which is in Paradise, seventy-two in the Fire.) They asked, "Who are they O Messenger of Allah!'' He replied;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÃóäóÇ Úóáóíúåö æóÃóÕúÍóÇÈöí»</div><br>  (Those upon what I and my Companions are upon. ) It was recorded by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak with this wording. So here Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÑóÈøóßó íóŞúÖöì Èóíúäóåõã</div><br>  (Verily your Lord will judge between them) Here the meaning is, to distinguish between them   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö İöíãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú İöíåö íóÎúÊóáöİõæäó</div><br>  (the Day of Resurrection in that which they used to differ.)  </div></body></html>
