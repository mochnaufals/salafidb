In the year of the victory of Makkah he wrote to the Quraysh alerting them that the Messenger of Allah intended to march towards them. Allah informed His Messenger of this, and he sent a Companion to retrieve the letter that Hatib sent, and then he summoned him. He admitted to what he did. `Umar bin Al-Khattab stood up and said, "O Allah's Messenger! Should I cut off his head, for he has betrayed Allah, His Messenger and the believers'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÏóÚúåõ İóÅöäøóåõ ŞóÏú ÔóåöÏó ÈóÏúÑğÇ¡ æóãóÇ íõÏúÑöíßó áóÚóáøó Çááåó ÇØøóáóÚó Úóáóì Ãóåúáö ÈóÏúÑò İóŞóÇáó: ÇÚúãóáõæÇ ãóÇ ÔöÆúÊõãú İóŞóÏú ÛóİóÑúÊõ áóßõã»</div><br>  (Leave him! He participated in Badr. How do you know that Allah has not looked at those who participated in Badr and said, Do whatever you want, for I have forgiven you.)  However, it appears that this Ayah is more general, even if it was revealed about a specific incident. Such rulings are dealt with by their indications, not the specific reasons behind revealing them, according to the majority of scholars.  Betrayal includes both minor and major sins, as well those that affect others. `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÎõæäõæÇú ÃóãóÜäóÜÊößõãú</div><br>  (nor betray your Amanat) "The Amanah refers to the actions that Allah has entrusted the servants with, such as and including what He ordained. Therefore, Allah says here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊóÎõæäõæÇú</div><br>  (nor betray...), `do not abandon the obligations.''' `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd commented, "Allah forbade you from betraying Him and His Messenger, as hypocrites do.''  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÚúáóãõæÇú ÃóäøóãóÂ Ãóãúæóáõßõãú æóÃóæúáóÜÏõßõãú İöÊúäóÉñ</div><br>  (And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial.) from Him to you. He grants these to you so that He knows which of you will be grateful and obedient to Him, or become busy with and dedicated to them instead of Him. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÂ Ãóãúæóáõßõãú æóÃóæúáóÜÏõßõãú İöÊúäóÉñ æóÇááøóåõ ÚöäúÏóåõ ÃóÌúÑñ ÚóÙöíãñ </div><br>  (Your wealth and your children are only a trial, whereas Allah! With Him is a great reward.) 64:15,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÈúáõæßõã ÈöÇáÔøóÑøö æóÇáúÎóíúÑö İöÊúäóÉğ</div><br>  (And We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good.) 21:35,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó Êõáúåößõãú Ãóãúæóáõßõãú æóáÇó ÃóæúáóÜÏõßõãú Úóä ĞößúÑö Çááøóåö æóãóä íóİúÚóáú Ğóáößó İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÎóÜÓöÑõæäó </div><br>  (O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And whosoever does that, then they are the losers.)63:9, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú Åöäøó ãöäú ÃóÒúæóÌößõãú æóÃóæúáÜÏößõãú ÚóÏõæøÇğ áøóßõãú İóÇÍúĞóÑõæåõãú</div><br>  (O you who believe! Verily, among your wives and your children there are enemies for you (who may stop you from the obedience of Allah); therefore beware of them!) 64:14 Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó Çááøóåó ÚöäÏóåõ ÃóÌúÑñ ÚóÙöíãñ</div><br>  (And that surely with Allah is a mighty reward.) Therefore, Allah's reward, favor and Paradise are better for you than wealth and children. Certainly, among the wealth and children there might be enemies for you and much of them avail nothing. With Allah alone is the decision and sovereignty in this life and the Hereafter, and He gives tremendous rewards on the Day of Resurrection. In the Sahih, there is a Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ËóáóÇËñ ãóäú ßõäøó İöíåö¡ æóÌóÏó Èöåöäøó ÍóáóÇæóÉó ÇáúÅöíãóÇäö: ãóäú ßóÇäó Çááåõ æóÑóÓõæáõåõ ÃóÍóÈøó Åöáóíúåö ãöãøóÇ ÓöæóÇåõãóÇ¡ æóãóäú ßóÇäó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúãóÑúÁó áóÇ íõÍöÈøõåõ ÅöáøóÇ ááåö¡ æóãóäú ßóÇäó Ãóäú íõáúŞóì İöí ÇáäøóÇÑö ÃóÍóÈøó Åöáóíúåö ãöäú Ãóäú íóÑúÌöÚó Åöáóì ÇáúßõİúÑö ÈóÚúÏó ÅöĞú ÃóäúŞóĞóåõ Çááåõ ãöäúå»</div><br>  (There are three qualities for which whomever has them, he will have tasted the sweetness of faith. (They are:) whoever Allah and His Messenger are dearer to him than anyone else, whoever loves a person for Allah's sake alone, and whoever prefers to be thrown in fire rather than revert to disbelief, after Allah has saved him from it.)  Therefore, loving the Messenger of Allah comes before loving children, wealth and oneself. In the Sahih, it is confirmed that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö áóÇ íõÄúãöäõ ÃóÍóÏõßõãú ÍóÊøóì Ãóßõæäó ÃóÍóÈøó Åöáóíúåö ãöäú äóİúÓöåö æóÃóåúáöåö æóãóÇáöåö æóÇáäøóÇÓö ÃóÌúãóÚöíä»</div><br>  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! None of you will have faith unless I become dearer to him than himself, his family, his wealth and all people.)  </div></body></html>
