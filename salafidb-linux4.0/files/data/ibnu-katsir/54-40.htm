This is why Allah destroyed them with a type of torment that He never inflicted upon any nation before them. Allah the Exalted commanded Jibril, peace be upon him, to raise their cities to the sky and then turn them upside down over them, followed by stones made of marked Sijjil. So He said here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ÍóÜÕöÈÇğ ÅöáÇøó Âáó áõæØò äøóÌøóíúäóÜåõã ÈöÓóÍóÑò </div><br>  (Verily, We sent against them Hasib (a violent storm of stones) except the family of Lut, them We saved in the last hour of the night.) They left the city in the last part of the night and were saved from the torment that struck their people, none of whom believed in Lut. And even Lut's wife suffered the same end as her people. Allah's Prophet Lut left Sodom with his daughters in safety, unharmed. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó äóÌúÒöì ãóä ÔóßóÑóæóáóŞóÏú ÃóäĞóÑóåõãú ÈóØúÔóÊóäóÇ</div><br>  (Thus do We reward him who gives thanks. And he indeed had warned them of Our punishment,) meaning, before the torment struck his people, he warned them of Allah's torment and punishment. They did not heed the warning, nor listen to Lut, but instead doubted and disputed the warning.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÑóÇæóÏõæåõ Úóä Öóíúİöåö</div><br>  (And they indeed sought to shame his guests) that is the night the angels Jibril, Mika'il and Israfil came to him in the shape of handsome young men, as a test from Allah for Lut's people. Lut hosted his guests, while his wife, the evil old one, sent a message to her people informing them of Lut's guests. They came to him in haste from every direction, and Lut had to close the door in their faces. They came during the night and tried to break the door; Lut tried to fend them off, while shielding his guests from them, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜÄõáÂÁö ÈóäóÇÊöì Åöä ßõäúÊõãú İóÜÚöáöíäó</div><br>  (These are my daughters, if you must act (so).) (15:71), in reference to their women,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú áóŞóÏú ÚóáöãúÊó ãóÇ áóäóÇ İöì ÈóäóÇÊößó ãöäú ÍóŞøò</div><br>  (They said: "Surely, you know that we have neither any desire nor need of your daughters!'')(11:79), meaning, `we do not have any desire for women,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóßó áóÊóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ äõÑöíÏõ</div><br>  (and indeed you know well what we want!)(11:79) When the situation became serious and they insisted on coming in, Jibril went out to them and struck their eyes with the tip of his wing, causing them to lose their sight. They went back feeling for the walls to guide them, threatening Lut with what would befall him in the morning. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÕóÈøóÍóåõã ÈõßúÑóÉğ ÚóĞóÇÈñ ãøõÓúÊóŞöÑøñ </div><br>  (And verily, an abiding torment seized them early in the morning.) meaning, a torment that they had no way of escaping or avoiding,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞõæŞõæÇú ÚóĞóÇÈöì æóäõĞõÑö æóáóŞóÏú íóÓøóÑúäóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäó áöáĞøößúÑö İóåóáú ãöä ãøõÏøóßöÑò </div><br>  (Then taste you My torment and My warnings.
