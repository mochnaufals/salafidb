Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "The Christians of Najran and Jewish rabbis gathered before the Messenger of Allah and disputed in front of him. The rabbis said, `Ibrahim was certainly Jewish.' The Christians said, `Certainly, Ibrahim was Christian.' So Allah sent down,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóåúáó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö áöãó ÊõÍóÂÌøõæäó İöì ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó</div><br>  (O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim,) meaning, `How is it that you, Jews, claim that Ibrahim was Jew, although he lived before Allah sent down the Tawrah to Musa How is it that you, Christians, claim that Ibrahim was Christian, although Christianity came after his time'' This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó ÊóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (Have you then no sense)  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åÃóäÊõãú åóÜÄõáÇÁö ÍóÜÌóÌúÊõãú İöíãóÇ áóßõã Èöåö Úöáãñ İóáöãó ÊõÍóÂÌøõæäó İöíãóÇ áóíúÓó áóßõãú Èöåö Úöáúãñ</div><br>  c(Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge)  This Ayah criticizes those who argue and dispute without knowledge, just as the Jews and Christians did concerning Ibrahim. Had they disputed about their religions, which they had knowledge of, and about the Law that was legislated for them until Muhammad was sent, it would have been better for them. Rather, they disputed about what they had no knowledge of, so Allah criticized them for this behavior. Allah commanded them to refer what they have no knowledge of to He Who knows the seen and unseen matters and Who knows the true reality of all things. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóÚúáóãõ æóÃóäÊõãú áÇó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.)

This Ayah means, "The people who have the most right to be followers of Ibrahim are those who followed his religion and this Prophet, Muhammad , and his Companions from the Muhajirin, Ansar and those who followed their lead.'' Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó áößõáøö äóÈöíó æõáóÇÉğ ãöäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó¡ æóÅöäøó æóáöíøöí ãöäúåõãú ÃóÈöí æóÎóáöíáõ ÑóÈøöí ÚóÒøó æóÌóá»</div><br>  (Every Prophet had a Wali (supporter, best friend) from among the Prophets.
