It was reported in the Two Sahihs through more than one chain of narration that the Messenger of Allah , who is the leader of the sons of Adam and the greatest intercessor before Allah, will go to stand in Al-Maqam Al-Mahmud (the praised position) to intercede for all of mankind when their Lord comes to pass judgement upon them.

This also refers to the great degree of His might and power. When He speaks words of revelation, the inhabitants of the heavens hear what He says, and they tremble with fear (of Allah) so much that they swoon. This was the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Masruq and others.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ İõÒøöÚó Úóä ŞõáõæÈöåöãú</div><br>  (So much so that when fear is banished from their hearts,) means, when the fear leaves their hearts. Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Abu `Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami, Ash-Sha`bi, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dhahhak, Al-Hasan and Qatadah said concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ İõÒøöÚó Úóä ŞõáõæÈöåöãú ŞóÇáõæÇú ãóÇĞóÇ ŞóÇáó ÑóÈøõßõãú ŞóÇáõæÇú ÇáúÍóŞøó</div><br>  (So much so that when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: "What is it that your Lord has said'' They say the truth.) "When the fear is lifted from their hearts.'' When this happens, some of them say to others, "What did your Lord say'' Those (angels) who are carrying the Throne tell those who are next to them, then they in turn pass it on to those who are next to them, and so on, until the news reaches the inhabitants of the lowest heaven. Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú ÇáúÍóŞøó</div><br>  They say the truth. meaning, they report what He said, without adding or taking away anything.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáúÚóáöìøõ ÇáúßóÈöíÑõ</div><br>  (And He is the Most High, the Most Great.)

When the fear is banished from their hearts, they say, "What is it that your Lord has said'' They say the truth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great. Then the one who is listening out hears that, and those who are listening out are standing one above the other) -- Sufyan one of the narrators demonstrated with his hand, holding it vertically with the fingers outspread. (So he hears what is said and passes it on to the one below him, and that one passes it to the one who is below him, and so on until it reaches the lips of the soothsayer or fortune-teller. Maybe a meteor will hit him before he can pass anything on, or maybe he will pass it on before he is hit. He tells a hundred lies alongside it, but it will be said, "Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such and such would happen'' So they believe him because of the one thing which was heard from heaven.)'' This was recorded by Al-Bukhari, not by Muslim. Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also recorded it. And Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
