He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íŞóæúãö ÇÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇÑúÌõæÇú Çáúíóæúãó ÇáÇøñÎöÑó</div><br>  (O my people! Worship Allah and hope for the last Day,) Ibn Jarir said: "Some of them said that this meant: Fear the Last Day.'' This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöãóä ßóÇäó íóÑúÌõæ Çááøóåó æóÇáúíóæúãó ÇáÇøñÎöÑó</div><br>  (for those who look forward to (meeting with) Allah and the Last Day) (60:6).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÚúËóæúÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ãõİúÓöÏöíäó</div><br>  (and commit no mischief on the earth as mischief-makers.) This is forbidding them to make mischief on earth by spreading corruption, which means going around doing evil to people. They used to cheat in weights and measures, and ambush people on the road; this is in addition to their disbelief in Allah and His Messenger. So Allah destroyed them with a mighty earthquake that convulsed their land, and the Sayhah (shout) which tore their hearts from their bodies, and the torment of the Day of Shade, when their souls were taken. This was the torment of a great day. We have already examined their story in detail in Surat Al-A`raf, Surat Hud and Surat Ash-Shu`ara'.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÕúÈóÍõæÇú İöí ÏóÇÑöåöãú ÌóÜËöãöíäó</div><br>  (and they lay, prostrate in their dwellings.) Qatadah said, "They were dead.'' Others said that they were thrown on top of one another.  </div></body></html>
