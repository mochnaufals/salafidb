Ibn `Abbas, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others said, "Az-Zabur is that which was revealed to Dawud, and Adh-Dhikr is the Tawrah.'' Mujahid said: "Az-Zabur means the Books which came after Adh-Dhikr, and Adh-Dhikr is the Mother of the Book (Umm Al-Kitab) which is with Allah.''

And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness in their ears, and it is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away.'') 41:44 Muslim reports in his Sahih: Ibn Abi `Umar told us, Marwan Al-Fazari told us, from Yazid bin Kisan, from Ibn Abi Hazim that Abu Hurayrah said that it was said, "O Messenger of Allah, pray against the idolators.'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí áóãú ÃõÈúÚóËú áóÚøóÇäğÇ¡ æóÅöäøóãóÇ ÈõÚöËúÊõ ÑóÍúãóÉ»</div><br>  (I was not sent as a curse, rather I was sent as a mercy.) This was recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Abi Qurrah Al-Kindi said: "Hudhayfah was in Al-Mada'in and he was mentioning things that the Messenger of Allah had said. Hudhayfah came to Salman and Salman said: `O Hudhayfah, the Messenger of Allah would sometimes be angry and would speak accordingly, and would sometimes be pleased and would speak accordingly. I know that the Messenger of Allah  addressed us and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóíøõãóÇ ÑóÌõáò ãöäú ÃõãøóÊöí ÓóÈóÈúÊõåõ (ÓóÈøóÉğ) İöí ÛóÖóÈöí Ãóæú áóÚóäúÊõåõ áóÚúäóÉğ¡ İóÅöäøóãóÇ ÃóäóÇ ÑóÌõáñ ãöäú æóáóÏö ÂÏóãó ÃóÛúÖóÈõ ßóãóÇ ÊóÛúÖóÈõæäó¡ ÅöäøóãóÇ ÈóÚóËóäöí Çááåõ ÑóÍúãóÉğ áöáúÚóÇáóãöíäó İóÇÌúÚóáúåóÇ ÕóáóÇÉğ Úóáóíúåö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (Any man of my Ummah whom I have insulted or cursed when I was angry -- for I am a man from among the sons of Adam, and I get angry just as you do. But Allah has sent me as a Mercy to the Worlds, so I will make that my anger into blessings for him on the Day of Resurrection.'') This was also recorded by Abu Dawud from Ahmad bin Yunus from Za'idah. It may be asked: what kind of mercy do those who disbelieve in him get The answer is what Abu Ja`far bin Jarir recorded from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÜßó ÅöáÇøó ÑóÍúãóÉğ áøöáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (And We have sent you not but as a mercy for the `Alamin. ) He said, "Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, mercy will be decreed for him in this world and in the Hereafter; whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, will be protected from that which happened to the nations of earthquakes and stoning.''  </div></body></html>
