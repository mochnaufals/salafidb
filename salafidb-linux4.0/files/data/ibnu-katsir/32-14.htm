They will say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÈúÕóÑúäóÇ æóÓóãöÚúäóÇ</div><br>  (Our Lord! We have now seen and heard,) meaning, `now we hear what You say and we will obey You.' This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÓúãöÚú Èöåöãú æóÃóÈúÕöÑú íóæúãó íóÃúÊõæäóäóÇ</div><br>  (How clearly will they see and hear, the Day when they will appear before Us!) (19:38). And they will blame themselves when they enter the Fire, and will say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú ßõäøóÇ äóÓúãóÚõ Ãóæú äóÚúŞöáõ ãóÇ ßõäøóÇ İöì ÃóÕúÍóÜÈö ÇáÓøóÚöíÑö</div><br>  ("Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!'') 67:10 Similarly, here they are described as saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÈúÕóÑúäóÇ æóÓóãöÚúäóÇ İóÇÑúÌöÚúäóÇ</div><br>  (Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back) to the world,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÚúãóáú ÕóÜáöÍÇğ ÅöäøóÇ ãõæŞöäõæäó</div><br>  (that we will do righteous good deeds. Verily, we now believe with certainty.) means, `now we are sure and we believe that Your promise is true and that the meeting with You is true.' But the Lord, may He be exalted, knows that if He were to send them back to this world, they would behave as they did previously, and they would reject and disbelieve in the signs of Allah and would go against His Messengers, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÊóÑóì ÅöĞú æõŞöİõæÇú Úóáóì ÇáäøóÇÑö İóŞóÇáõæÇú íáóíúÊóäóÇ äõÑóÏøõ æóáÇó äõßóĞøöÈó ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊö ÑóÈøöäóÇ</div><br>  (If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: "Would that we were but sent back! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord,'') (6: 27) And Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÔöÆúäóÇ áÇøÊóíúäóÇ ßõáøó äóİúÓò åõÏóÇåóÇ</div><br>  (And if We had willed, surely We would have given every person his guidance,) This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó ÑóÈøõßó áÂãóäó ãóä İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ßõáøõåõãú ÌóãöíÚğÇ</div><br>  (And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together) (10:99).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöäú ÍóŞøó ÇáúŞóæúáõ ãöäúì áÇøãúáÃóäøó Ìóåóäøóãó ãöäó ÇáúÌöäøóÉö æóÇáäøóÇÓö ÃóÌúãóÚöíäó</div><br>  (but the Word from Me took effect, that I will fill Hell with Jinn and mankind together.) i.e., from both classes, so their abode will be Hell and they will have no escape from it and no way out. We seek refuge with Allah and in His perfect Words from that.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞõæŞõæÇú ÈöãóÇ äóÓöíÊõãú áöŞóÂÁó íóæúãößõãú åóÜĞóÂ</div><br>  (Then taste because of your forgetting the meeting of this Day of yours.) means, it will be said to the people of Hell by way of rebuke: `taste this punishment because you denied it and believed that it would never happen; you tried to forget about it and acted as if you had forgotten it.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ äóÓöíäóÜßõãú</div><br>  (Surely, We too will forget you,) means, `We will deal with you as if We have forgotten you,' but nothing escapes Allah's attention, and He makes the punishment fit the crime, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çáúíóæúãó äóäÓóÇßõãú ßóãóÇ äóÓöíÊõãú áöŞóÂÁó íóæúãößõãú åóÜĞóÇ</div><br>  (This Day We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours) (45:34).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóĞõæŞõÜæÇú ÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáúÎõáúÏö ÈöãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (so taste you the abiding torment for what you used to do.) i.e., because of your disbelief and rejection, as Allah says in another Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóĞõæŞõæäó İöíåóÇ ÈóÑúÏÇğ æóáÇó ÔóÑóÇÈÇğ - ÅöáÇøó ÍóãöíãÇğ æóÛóÓøóÇŞÇğ </div><br>  (Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink. Except Hamim, and Ghassaq) until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóä äøóÒöíÏóßõãú ÅöáÇøó ÚóĞóÇÈÇğ</div><br>  (No increase shall We give you, except in torment) (78:24-30).  </div></body></html>
