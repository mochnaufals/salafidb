He also warns them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä äøóØúãöÓó æõÌõæåÇğ İóäóÑõÏøóåóÇ Úóáóì ÃóÏúÈóÜÑöåóÂ</div><br>  (before We efface faces and turn them backwards) Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said that `effacing' here refers to blindness,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóäóÑõÏøóåóÇ Úóáóì ÃóÏúÈóÜÑöåóÂ</div><br>  (and turn them backwards) meaning, We put their faces on their backs, and make them walk backwards, since their eyes will be in their backs. Similar was said by Qatadah and `Atiyah Al-`Awfi. This makes the punishment even more severe, and it is a parable that Allah set for ignoring the truth, preferring the wrong way and turning away from the plain path for the paths of misguidance. Therefore, such people walk backwards.  Similarly, some said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöì ÃóÚúäÜŞöåöãú ÃóÛúáóÜáÇğ İóåöìó Åöáóì ÇáÇøñĞúŞóÜäö İóåõã ãøõŞúãóÍõæäó æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ãöä Èóíúäö ÃóíúÏöíåöãú ÓóÏøÇğ</div><br>  (Verily, We have put on their necks iron collars reaching to the chins, so that their heads are raised up. And We have put a barrier before them) that is a parable that Allah gave for their deviation and hindrance from guidance. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Ka`b Al-Ahbar Embraces Islam Upon Hearing this Ayah [4:47]</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  It was reported that Ka`b Al-Ahbar became Muslim when he heard this Ayah 4:47. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Isa bin Al-Mughirah said: We were with Ibrahim when we talked about the time when Ka`b became Muslim. He said, `Ka`b became Muslim during the reign of `Umar, for he passed by Al-Madinah intending to visit Jerusalem, and `Umar said to him, "Embrace Islam, O Ka`b.' Ka`b said, `Do you not read in your Book,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóËóáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÍõãøöáõæÇú ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉó</div><br>  (The likeness of those who were entrusted with the Tawrah...) 62:5 until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÓúİóÇÑÇğ</div><br>  (Books) I am among those who were entrusted with the Tawrah.' `Umar left him alone and Ka`b went on to Hims (in Syria) and heard one of its inhabitants recite this Ayah while feeling sad,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÂ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ÁóÇãöäõæÇú ÈöãóÇ äóÒøóáúäóÇ ãõÕóÏøöŞÇğ áøöãóÇ ãóÚóßõãú ãøöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä äøóØúãöÓó æõÌõæåÇğ İóäóÑõÏøóåóÇ Úóáóì ÃóÏúÈóÜÑöåóÂ</div><br>  (O you who have been given the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Believe in what We have revealed confirming what is with you, before We efface faces and turn them backwards). Ka`b said, `I believe, O Lord! I embraced Islam, O Lord!' for He feared that this might be struck by this threat. He then went back to his family in Yemen and returned with them all as Muslims.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú äóáúÚóäóåõãú ßóãóÇ áóÚóäøóÂ ÃóÕúÍóÜÈó ÇáÓøóÈúÊö</div><br>  (or curse them as We cursed the people of the Sabbath.) refers to those who breached the sanctity of the Sabbath, using deceit, for the purpose of doing more work. Allah changed these people into apes and swine, as we will come to know in the explanation of Surat Al-A`raf (7). Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÃóãúÑõ Çááøóåö ãóİúÚõæáÇğ</div><br>  (And the commandment of Allah is always executed.) means, when He commands something, then no one can dispute or resist His command. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah Does not Forgive Shirk, Except After Repenting From it</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said that He,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÛúİöÑõ Ãóä íõÔúÑóßó Èöåö</div><br>  (forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship),) meaning, He does not forgive a servant if he meets Him while he is associating partners with Him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÛúİöÑõ ãóÇ Ïõæäó Ğóáößó</div><br>  (but He forgives except that) of sins,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (to whom He wills) of His servants. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó íóŞõæáõ: íóÇ ÚóÈúÏöí ãóÇ ÚóÈóÏúÊóäöí æóÑóÌóæúÊóäöí¡ İóÅöäøöí ÛóÇİöÑñ áóßó Úóáì ãóÇ ßóÇäó İöíßó¡ íóÇ ÚóÈúÏöí Åöäøóßó Åöäú áóŞöíÊóäöí ÈöŞõÑóÇÈö ÇáúÃóÑúÖö ÎóØöíÆóÉğ ãóÇ áóãú ÊõÔúÑößú Èöí¡ áóŞöíÊõßó ÈöŞõÑóÇÈöåóÇ ãóÛúİöÑóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah said, "O My servant! As long as you worship and beg Me, I will forgive you, no matter your shortcomings. O My servant! If you meet Me with the earth's fill of sin, yet you do not associate any partners with Me, I will meet you with its fill of forgiveness.'') Only Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said, "I came to the Messenger of Allah and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú ÚóÈúÏò ŞóÇáó: áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ Ëõãøó ãóÇÊó Úóáóì Ğóáößó¡ ÅöáøóÇ ÏóÎóáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  ŞáÊ:æÅä Òäì æÅä ÓÑŞ¿ ŞÇá:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÅöäú Òóäóì æóÅöäú ÓóÑóŞ»</div><br>  .

I said, "Even if he committed adultery and theft'' He said, "Even if he committed adultery and theft.'' I asked again, "Even if he committed adultery and theft'' He said, "Even if he committed adultery and theft.'' The fourth time, he said, "Even if Abu Dharr's nose was put in the dust.'') Abu Dharr departed while pulling his Izar and saying, "Even if Abu Dharr's nose was put in the dust.'' Ever since that happened, Abu Dharr used to narrate the Hadith and then comment, "Even if Abu Dharr's nose was put in dust.'' The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith Al-Bazzar recorded that Ibn `Umar said, "We used to refrain from begging (Allah) for forgiveness for those who commit major sins until we heard our Prophet reciting,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íóÛúİöÑõ Ãóä íõÔúÑóßó Èöåö æóíóÛúİöÑõ ãóÇ Ïõæäó Ğóáößó áöãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills;), and his saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÎøóÑúÊõ ÔóİóÇÚóÊöí áöÃóåúáö ÇáúßóÈóÇÆöÑö ãöäú ÃõãøóÊöí íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (I have reserved my intercession on the Day of Resurrection for those among my Ummah who commit major sins.)''
