This means that He, the Exalted, created the human being while he was nothing. So can he not repeat this creation after the human had actually become something Similalry Allah says;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íóÈúÏóÃõ ÇáúÎóáúŞó Ëõãøó íõÚöíÏõåõ æóåõæó Ãóåúæóäõ Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) 30:27 In the Sahih it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì: ßóĞøóÈóäöí ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó æóáóãú íóßõäú áóåõ Ãóäú íõßóĞøöÈóäöí¡ æóÂĞóÇäöí ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó æóáóãú íóßõäú áóåõ Ãóäú íõÄúĞöíóäöí¡ ÃóãøóÇ ÊóßúĞöíÈõåõ ÅöíøóÇíó İóŞóæúáõåõ áóäú íõÚöíÏóäöí ßóãóÇ ÈóÏóÃóäöí¡ æóáóíúÓó Ãóæøóáõ ÇáúÎóáúŞö ÈöÃóåúæóäó Úóáóíøó ãöäú ÂÎöÑöåö¡ æóÃóãøóÇ ÃóĞóÇåõ ÅöíøóÇíó İóŞóæúáõåõ Åöäøó áöí æóáóÏğÇ æóÃóäóÇ ÇáúÃóÍóÏõ ÇáÕøóãóÏõ ÇáøóĞöí áóãú íóáöÏú æóáóãú íõæáóÏú æóáóãú íóßõäú áóåõ ßõİõæğÇ ÃóÍóÏ»</div><br>  (Allah, the Exalted said, "The son of Adam denies Me and he has no right to deny Me.

Yet, the second creation is not more difficult upon Me than the first. His harming Me is his statement that I have a son. Yet, I am One Alone, the Self-Sufficient Whom all creatures need. He Who does not beget children, nor was He born and there is none coequal or comparable unto Him.'') Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóæóÑóÈøößó áóäóÍúÔõÑóäøóåõãú æóÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäó</div><br>  (So by your Lord, surely We shall gather them together, and the Shayatin,) The Lord, Blessed be He the Most High, swears by His Noble Self that He will definitely gather all of those who worshipped other than Allah and their devils as well.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó áóäõÍúÖöÑóäøóåõãú Íóæúáó Ìóåóäøóãó ÌöËöíøÇğ</div><br>  (then We shall bring them round Hell, Jithiyya.) Al-`Awfi related that Ibn `Abbas said, "This means sitting and it is similar to His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóì ßõáøó ÃõãøóÉò ÌóÇËöíóÉğ</div><br>  (And you will see each nation Jathiyah.)'' 45:28 As-Suddi commented on the word Jithiyya, "It means standing.'' It has been reported from Murrah that Ibn Mas`ud said the same.

Ath-Thawri reported from `Ali bin Al-Aqmar, from Abu Al-Ahwas, from Ibn Mas`ud that he said, "The first of them will be bound to the last of them until their number is complete. Then, they will be brought all together. Then, Allah will begin with the greatest of them in crime and continue in succession. That is Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó áóäóäÒöÚóäøó ãöä ßõáøö ÔöíÚóÉò Ãóíøõåõãú ÃóÔóÏøõ Úóáóì ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÚöÊöíøÇğ </div><br>  (Then indeed We shall drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against the Most Gracious.)

Until His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóßúÓöÈõæäó</div><br>  (For what you used to earn.) 7:38-39 The first of them will say to the last of them: "Your were not better than us, so taste the torment for what you used to earn.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó áóäóÍúäõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú Ãóæúáóì ÈöåóÇ ÕöáöíøÇğ </div><br>  (Then, verily, We know best those who are most worthy of being burnt therein.) Then, at this point Allah attaches one piece of information to another. The meaning here is that Allah best knows which of His creatures deserve to be burned in the fire of Hell and remain there forever and who deserves to have his punishment doubled. This is as He says in the Ayah that was previously mentioned,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó áößõáøò ÖöÚúİñ æóáóÜßöä áÇøó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (He will say: "For each one there is double (torment), but you know not.'') 7:38  </div></body></html>
