And out of the date-palm and its sprouts come forth clusters of dates hanging low and near, and gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranates, each similar, yet different. Look at their fruits when they begin to bear, and Yan`ih. Verily! In these things there are signs for people who believe.)

They, or most of them, also said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãõÓúÊóæúÏóÚñ</div><br>  (And Mustawda`,) means, `in your father's loins'. Ibn Mas`ud and several others said that, Mustaqar, means residence in this life, while, Mustawda`, means the place of storage after death (the grave). Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú İóÕøóáúäóÇ ÇáÇøñíóÜÊö áöŞóæúãò íóİúŞóåõæäó</div><br>  (Indeed, We have explained in detail Our revelations for people who understand.) refers to those who comprehend and understand Allah's Words and its meanings. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÃóäÒóáó ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ãóÂÁğ</div><br>  (It is He Who sends down water (rain) from the sky) in due measure, as a blessing and provision for the servants, relief and means of survival for the creatures and mercy from Allah for His creation. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÎúÑóÌúäóÇ Èöåö äóÈóÇÊó ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (And with it We bring forth vegetation of all kinds,) is similar to,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ãöäó ÇáúãóÂÁö ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò Íóìøò</div><br>  (And We have made from water every living thing.) 21:30   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÎúÑóÌúäóÇ ãöäúåõ ÎóÖöÑÇğ</div><br>  (and out of it We bring forth green stalks,) green produce and trees, on which We grow seeds and fruits.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äøõÎúÑöÌõ ãöäúåõ ÍóÈøÇğ ãøõÊóÑóÇßöÈÇğ</div><br>  (from which We bring forth thick clustered grain.) lined on top of each other in clusters, like an ear or spike of grain.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÎúáö ãöä ØóáúÚöåóÇ Şöäúæóäñ</div><br>  (And out of the date-palm and its sprouts come forth clusters) of dates   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏóÇäöíóÉñ</div><br>  (hanging low) Within reach and easy to pick. `Ali bin Abi Talhah Al-Walibi said that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şöäúæóäñ ÏóÇäöíóÉñ</div><br>  (clusters hanging low) refers to short date trees whose branches hang low, close to the ground. This was recorded by Ibn Jarir. Allah's statement   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóäøóÜÊò ãøöäú ÃóÚúäóÜÈò</div><br>  (and gardens of grapes,) means, We bring forth gardens of grapes. Grapes and dates are the most precious fruits to the people of Al-Hijaz (Western Arabia), and perhaps both are the best fruits in this world. Allah has reminded His servants of His favor in making these two fruits for them, when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ËóãóÑóÊö ÇáäøóÎöíáö æóÇáÇøñÚúäóÜÈö ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæäó ãöäúåõ ÓóßóÑğÇ æóÑöÒúŞğÇ ÍóÓóäğÇ</div><br>  (And from the fruits of date-palms and grapes, you derive strong drink and a goodly provision.) 16:67 before intoxicating drinks were prohibited, and;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöíåóÇ ÌóäøóÜÊò ãøöä äøóÎöíáò æóÃóÚúäóÜÈò</div><br>  (And We have made therein gardens of date-palms and grapes.) 36:34. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÒøóíúÊõæäó æóÇáÑøõãøóÇäó ãõÔúÊóÈöåÇğ æóÛóíúÑó ãõÊóÔóÜÈöåò</div><br>  (olives and pomegranates, each similar yet different.) The leaves are similar in shape and appearence, yet different in the shape, and taste. And the kind of fruit each plant produces is different, according to the explanation of Qatadah and several others. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇäúÙõÑõæÇú Åöáöì ËóãóÑöåö ÅöĞóÂ ÃóËúãóÑó æóíóäúÚöåö</div><br>  (Look at their fruits when they begin to bear, and Yan`ih.) means, when the fruits become ripe, according to Al-Bara' bin `Azib, Ibn `Abbas, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi, Qatadah and others. This Ayah means, contemplate the ability of the Creator of these fruits, Who brought them into existence after they were dry wood, and they later became grapes and dates; and similar is the case with the various colors, shapes, tastes and fragrance of whatever Allah created. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ŞöØóÚñ ãøõÊóÌóÜæöÑóÊñ æóÌóäøóÜÊñ ãøöäú ÃóÚúäóÜÈò æóÒóÑúÚñ æóäóÎöíáñ Õöäúæóäñ æóÛóíúÑõ Õöäúæóäò íõÓúŞóì ÈöãóÂÁò æóÍöÏò æóäõİóÖøöáõ ÈóÚúÖóåóÇ Úóáóì ÈóÚúÖò İöì ÇáÇøòßõáö</div><br>  (And in the earth are neighbouring tracts, and gardens of vines, and green crops, and date-palms, growing out, two or three from a single stem root, or otherwise, watered with the same water, yet some of them We make better than others to eat.) 13:4 This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğáößõãú</div><br>  (In these things there are...) O people,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøíóÜÊò</div><br>  (signs...) and proofs that testify to the perfect ability, wisdom and mercy of He Who created these things,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöŞóæúãò íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (for people who believe. ) in Allah and obey His Messengers.  </div></body></html>
