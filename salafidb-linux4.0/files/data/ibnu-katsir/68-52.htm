Various things happened to him, such as riding on a ship at sea, being swallowed by a (large) fish, the fish carrying him off into the ocean, being in the darkness and depth of the sea and hearing the sea's and its dwellers glorification of the Most High, the Most Able (Allah). For He (Allah) is the One Whose execution of divine decree cannot be resisted. After all of this, he (Yunus) called out from the layers of darkness,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä áÇøó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó ÃóäÊó ÓõÈúÍóÜäóßó Åöäøöì ßõäÊõ ãöäó ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  ("That none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah), Glorified (and Exalted) are You!

(21:87) Then Allah said concerning him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÓúÊóÌóÈúäóÇ áóåõ æóäóÌøóíúäóÜåõ ãöäó ÇáúÛóãøö æóßóĞáößó äõäÌöÜì ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (So We answered his call, and delivered him from the distress. And thus We do deliver the believers.)

(37:143,144) So here (in this Surah), Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú äóÇÏóì æóåõæó ãóßúÙõæãñ</div><br>  (when he cried out (to Us) while he was Makzum.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and As-Suddi, all said, "while he was distressed.'' Then Allah goes on to say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÌúÊóÈóÜåõ ÑóÈøõåõ İóÌóÚóáóåõ ãöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó </div><br>  (Then his Lord chose him and made him of the righteous.)

Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith and it is in the Two Sahihs reported from Abu Hurayrah. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä íóßóÇÏõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú áóíõÒúáöŞõæäóßó ÈöÃóÈúÕóÜÑöåöãú</div><br>  (And verily, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others have said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíõÒúáöŞõæäóßó</div><br>  (would make you slip) "In order to have some effect on you.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÃóÈúÕóÜÑöåöãú</div><br>  (with their eyes) meaning, `they will affect you by looking at you with their eyes (i.e., the evil eye).' This means `they are jealous of you due to their hatred of you, and were it not for Allah's protection of you, defending you against them (then their evil eye would harm you).' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Effect of the Evil Eye is Real</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  In this Ayah is a proof that the effect of the evil eye and its affliction by the command of Allah is real. Many Hadiths have been reported concerning this through numerous routes of transmission. The Hadith of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb Abu `Abdullah bin Majah recorded from Buraydah bin Al-Husayb that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÑõŞúíóÉó ÅöáøóÇ ãöäú Úóíúäò Ãóæú ÍõãóÉ»</div><br>  (There is no Ruqyah except to cure the evil eye and the sting.) This is how Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith. Imam Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih on the authority of Buraydah himself, but he did not attribute it to the Prophet . There is a story concerning this incident (as reported by Buraydah in Sahih Muslim), and At-Tirmidhi recorded the Hadith in this manner (like Muslim's version). This Hadith has also been recorded by Imam Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi on the authority of `Imran bin Husayn, however, he did not attribute it to the Prophet . `Imran's wording is,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÑõŞúíóÉó ÅöáøóÇ ãöäú Úóíúäò Ãóæú ÍõãóÉ»</div><br>  (There is no Ruqyah except to cure the evil eye and the sting.)'' Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ibn `Abbas that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÚóíúäõ ÍóŞøñ æóáóæú ßóÇäó ÔóíúÁñ ÓóÇÈóŞó ÇáúŞóÏóÑó ÓóÈóŞóÊö ÇáúÚóíúäõ æóÅöĞóÇ ÇÓúÊõÛúÓöáúÊõãú İóÇÛúÓöáõæÇ»</div><br>  (The evil eye is real. If anything were to overtake the divine decree (and change it), then it would be the evil eye. And if you perform Ghusl (to remove the evil eye) then wash well.) Muslim was alone in recording this Hadith, as Al-Bukhari did not mention it. It is reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "The Messenger of Allah used to invoke Allah's protection for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn (his grandsons) by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃõÚöíĞõßõãóÇ ÈößóáöãóÇÊö Çááåö ÇáÊøóÇãøóÉö ãöäú ßõáøö ÔóíúØóÇäò æóåóÇãøóÉò¡ æóãöäú ßõáøö Úóíúäò áóÇãøóÉ»</div><br>  (I seek protection for you two by the perfect Words of Allah from every Shaytan, and dangerous creature, and from every eye that is evil.) Then he would say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóßóĞóÇ ßóÇäó ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãõ íõÚóæøöĞõ ÅöÓúÍóÇŞó æóÅöÓúãóÇÚöíáó ÚóáóíúåöãóÇ ÇáÓøóáóÇã»</div><br>  (Thus, did Ibrahim used to seek protection for Ishaq and Isma`il (his sons).)'' This Hadith was recorded by Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Hadith of Abu Umamah As`ad bin Sahl bin Hunayf</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ibn Majah recorded from Abu Umamah As`ad bin Sahl bin Hunayf that `Amir bin Rabi`ah passed by Sahl bin Hunayf while he was bathing and he said, "I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today (i.e., commenting on how nice Sahl's skin was).'' So he did not leave before he (Sahl) fell down on the ground. So he was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him (the Prophet ) that Sahl had been afflicted by a seizure. The Prophet then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÊóÊøóåöãõæäó Èöåö¿»</div><br>  (Who do you blame (or hold responsible) for this) The people replied, ""Amir bin Rabi`ah.'' Then the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÚóáóÇãó íóŞúÊõáõ ÃóÍóÏõßõãú ÃóÎóÇåõ¿ ÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóì ÃóÍóÏõßõãú ãöäú ÃóÎöíåö ãóÇ íõÚúÌöÈõåõ İóáúíóÏúÚõ áóåõ ÈöÇáúÈóÑóßóÉ»</div><br>  (Would one of you knowingly kill his brother If one of you sees something of his brother that he likes, then let him supplicate for blessings for him.) Then the Prophet called for some water and he commanded `Amir to perform Wudu' with the water. So he washed his face, his hands up to his two elbows, his two knees, and the inside of his Izar. Then the Prophet commanded him to pour the water over Sahl. Sufyan said that Ma`mar related from Az-Zuhri that he said, "The Prophet ordered him to turn the water pot over (empty its contents over) him (Sahl) from behind him.'' An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith through different routes from Abu Umamah with the wording, "And he turned the pot over pouring its contents over him (Sahl) from behind him.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Hadith of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, "The Messenger of Allah used to seek refuge from the evil eye of the Jinns and the evil eye of humans. Then when the Mu`awwidhatan were revealed, he used them (for seeking protection) and abandoned everything else. This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Hadith from Abu Sa`id Imam</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, "O Muhammad, are you suffering from any ailment'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóã»</div><br>  (Yes).'' Then Jibril said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈöÇÓúãö Çááåö ÃóÑúŞöíßó ãöäú ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò íõÄúĞöíßó¡ æóãöäú ÔóÑøö ßõáøö äóİúÓò æóÚóíúäò ÊóÔúäöíßó¡ æóÇááåõ íóÔúİöíßó¡ ÈöÇÓúãö Çááåö ÃóÑúŞöíß»</div><br>  ("In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from the evil of every soul and every evil eye that hates you, may Allah cure you, in the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing.'') This Hadith has been recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers except for Abu Dawud. Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa`id or Jabir bin `Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah was bothered by some illness, and Jibril came to him and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈöÇÓúãö Çááåö ÃóÑúŞöíßó ãöäú ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò íõÄúĞöíßó¡ ãöäú ßõáøö ÍóÇÓöÏò æóÚóíúäò¡ Çááåõ íóÔúİöíß»</div><br>  (In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from every envious person and evil eye, may Allah cure you.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Hadith from Abu Sa`id</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, "O Muhammad, are you suffering from any ailment'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóã»</div><br>  (Yes).''

This Hadith has been recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers except for Abu Dawud. Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa`id or Jabir bin `Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah was bothered by some illness, and Jibril came to him and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈöÇÓúãö Çááåö ÃóÑúŞöíßó ãöäú ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò íõÄúĞöíßó¡ ãöäú ßõáøö ÍóÇÓöÏò æóÚóíúäò¡ Çááåõ íóÔúİöíß»</div><br>  (In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing (Ruqyah), from everything that bothers you, from every envious person and evil eye, may Allah cure you.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Hadith of Asma' bint `Umays</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded from `Ubayd bin Rifa`ah Az-Zuraqi that Asma' said, "O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Bani Ja`far are afflicted with the evil eye; should I seek to have Ruqyah '' The Prophet replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú İóáóæú ßóÇäó ÔóíúÁñ íóÓúÈöŞõ ÇáúŞóÏóÑó áóÓóÈóŞóÊúåõ ÇáúÚóíúä»</div><br>  (Yes, for if anything could overcome the divine decree, it would be the evil eye.) This Hadith has been recorded like this by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said concerning it, "Hasan Sahih.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Hadith of `A'ishah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ibn Majah recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Messenger of Allah ordered her to have Ruqyah performed as a cure against the evil eye. This was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. The Hadith of Sahl bin Hunayf Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunayf that his father informed him that the Messenger of Allah went out on a journey in the direction of Makkah and they (the Companions) accompanied him until they came to the valley of Kharrar from Al-Juhfah. They stopped there and Sahl took a bath. He (Sahl) was a white man, with a handsome body and nice skin. So the brother of Bani `Adi bin Ka`b, `Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at Sahl while he bathed and he said, "I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today.'' Then Sahl suddenly had a seizure and fell to the ground. So he (Sahl) was brought to the Messenger of Allah and it was said to him, "O Messenger of Allah! Can you do anything for Sahl By Allah, he has not lifted his head nor has he regained consciousness.'' The Prophet then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóáú ÊóÊøóåöãõæäó İöíåö ãöäú ÃóÍóÏò¿»</div><br>  (Do you all blame (or hold responsible) anyone for what has happened to him) They said, "`Amir bin Rabi`ah looked at him.'' So the Prophet called `Amir and he was very angry with him. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÚóáóÇãó íóŞúÊõáõ ÃóÍóÏõßõãú ÃóÎóÇåõ¡ åóáøóÇ ÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóíúÊó ãóÇ íõÚúÌöÈõßó ÈóÑøóßúÊó¿»</div><br>  (Would one of you knowingly kill his brother Why don't you ask Allah to bless your brother when you see something (of him) that you like) Then the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÛúÊóÓöáú áóå»</div><br>  (Bathe for him.) So he (`Amir) washed his face, his hands, his elbows, his knees, his feet and the inside of his Izar (waist wrapper) in a drinking vessel. Then that water was poured over him (Sahl). A man poured it over Sahl's head and his back from behind him, then the container was turned upside down and emptied behind him. This was done, and afterwards Sahl recovered and left with the people having nothing wrong with him.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Hadith of `Amir bin Rabi`ah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that `Ubaydullah bin `Amir said, "`Amir bin Rabi`ah and Sahl bin Hanayf went off together intending to bathe. So they went about their business using coverings (to cover their nakedness). So `Amir removed a cloak of wool that he (Sahl) was using to conceal himself. He (`Amir) said, `I looked at him and my eye fell upon him while he was pouring water on himself bathing. Then I heard a loud splash in the water coming from where he was. So I went to him, and I called him three times, but he did not answer me. So I went to the Prophet and informed him. Then, the Prophet came walking, and he was wading in the water. I can still picture the whiteness of his shins. When he came to Sahl (who was unconscious), he hit him on his chest with his hand and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó ÇÕúÑöİú Úóäúåõ ÍóÑøóåóÇ æóÈóÑúÏóåóÇ æóæóÕóÈóåóÇ»</div><br>  (O Allah! Remove from him its heat, its cold and its pain.) He (Sahl) then stood up, and Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóì ÃóÍóÏõßõãú ãöäú ÃóÎöíåö¡ Ãóæú ãöäú äóİúÓöåö¡ Ãóæú ãöäú ãóÇáöåö ãóÇ íõÚúÌöÈõåõ¡ İóáúíõÈóÑøößú İóÅöäøó ÇáúÚóíúäó ÍóŞ»</div><br>  (If one of you sees in his brother, or himself, or his wealth that which pleases him, then he should ask Allah to bless it, for verily, the evil eye is real.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Accusation of the Disbelievers and the Reply to Them</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæäó Åöäøóåõ áóãóÌúäõæäñ</div><br>  (and they say: "Verily, he is a madman!'') meaning, they cut at him with their eyes and attack him with their tongues saying, "Verily, he is a madman.'' They say this because he came with the Qur'an. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ åõæó ÅöáÇøó ĞößúÑñ áøöáúÚóÇáóãöíäó </div><br>  (But it is nothing else but a Reminder to all the creatures (`Alamin).)
