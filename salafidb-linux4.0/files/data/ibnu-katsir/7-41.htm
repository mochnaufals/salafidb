Ath-Thawri narrated that, Layth said that `Ata' narrated this from Ibn `Abbas. It was also said that the meaning here is that the doors of the heavens will not be opened for the disbelievers' souls, according to Ad-Dahhak who reported this from Ibn `Abbas. As-Suddi and several others mentioned this meaning. What further supports this meaning, is the report from Ibn Jarir that Al-Bara' said that the Messenger of Allah mentioned capturing the soul of the `Fajir' (wicked sinner or disbeliever), and that his or her soul will be ascended to heaven. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóíóÕúÚóÏõæäó ÈöåóÇ¡ İóáóÇ ÊóãõÑøõ Úóáóì ãóáóÃò ãöäó ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉö ÅöáøóÇ ŞóÇáõæÇ ãóÇ åóĞöåö ÇáÑøõæÍõ ÇáúÎóÈöíËóÉõ¿ İóíóŞõæáõæäó: İõáóÇäñ ÈöÃóŞúÈóÍö ÃóÓúãóÇÆöåö ÇáøóÊöí ßóÇäó íõÏúÚóì ÈöåóÇ İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ ÍóÊøóì íóäúÊóåóæÇ ÈöåóÇ Åöáóì ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö İóíóÓúÊóİúÊóÍõæäó ÈóÇÈóåóÇ áóåõ İóáóÇ íóİúÊóÍõ áóå»</div><br>  (So they (angels) ascend it and it will not pass by a gathering of the angels, but they will ask, who's wicked soul is this' They will reply, `The soul of so-and-so,' calling him by the worst names he was called in this life. When they reach the (lower) heaven, they will ask that its door be opened for the soul, but it will not be opened for it.) The Prophet then recited,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊõİóÊøóÍõ áóåõãú ÃóÈúæóÈõ ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö</div><br>  (For them the gates of heaven will not be opened). This is a part of a long Hadith which was also recorded by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. Ibn Jurayj commented on the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊõİóÊøóÍõ áóåõãú ÃóÈúæóÈõ ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö</div><br>  (for them the gates of heaven will not be opened,) "(The gates of heaven) will not be opened for their deeds or souls.'' This explanation combines the two meanings we gave above, and Allah knows best. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÏúÎõáõæäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ÍóÊøóì íóáöÌó ÇáúÌóãóáõ İöì Óóãøö ÇáúÎöíóÇØö</div><br>  (and they will not enter Paradise until the Jamal goes through the eye of the needle.) refers to the male camel. Ibn Mas`ud said it is a male camel from the she camel. In another narration it refers to the spouse of the she camel. Mujahid and `Ikrimah said that Ibn `Abbas used to recite this Ayah this way, "Until the Jummal goes through the eye of the needle'', whereas `Jummal' is a thick rope. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõã ãøöä Ìóåóäøóãó ãöåóÇÏñ</div><br>  (Theirs will be Mihad from the Fire) means, beds, while;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä İóæúŞöåöãú ÛóæóÇÔò</div><br>  (and over them Ghawash), means, coverings, according to Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. Similar was said by Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim and As-Suddi. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞóáößó äóÌúÒöì ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.)  </div></body></html>
