Mujahid said, "As-Samiri threw what was in his hand onto the jewelry of the Children of Israel and it became molded into the body of a calf, which made a light moaning sound. The wind that blew into it was the cause of its sound.'' Thus, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóäóÈóĞúÊõåóÇ</div><br>  (and I threw it.)
