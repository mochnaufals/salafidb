Now, it is good to fight (defending you) O Leader of the Faithful!' He said, `O Abu Hurayrah!

Saving life in this case occurs by not killing a soul that Allah has forbidden. So this is the meaning of saving the life of all mankind, for whoever forbids killing a soul without justification, the lives of all people will be saved from him.'' Similar was said by Mujahid;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäú ÃóÍúíóÜåóÇ</div><br>  (And if anyone saved a life...) means, he refrains from killing a soul. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóÃóäøóãóÇ ŞóÊóáó ÇáäøóÇÓó ÌóãöíÚÇğ</div><br>  (it would be as if he killed all mankind. .) means, "Whoever kills one soul that Allah has forbidden killing, is just like he who kills all mankind.'' Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "He who allows himself to shed the blood of a Muslim, is like he who allows shedding the blood of all people. He who forbids shedding the blood of one Muslim, is like he who forbids shedding the blood of all people.''

This Ayah chastises and criticizes those who commit the prohibitions, after knowing that they are prohibited from indulging in them. The Jews of Al-Madinah, such as Banu Qurayzah, An-Nadir and Qaynuqa`, used to fight along with either Khazraj or Aws, when war would erupt between them during the time of Jahiliyyah. When these wars would end, the Jews would ransom those who were captured and pay the blood money for those who were killed.

Mischief in the land refers to various types of evil. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Ikrimah and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that the Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÌóÒóÂÁõ ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÍóÇÑöÈõæäó Çááøóåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ</div><br>  (The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger) until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (Allah is Of-Forgiving, Most Merciful,) "Were revealed about the idolators. Therefore, the Ayah decrees that, whoever among them repents before you apprehend them, then you have no right to punish them. This Ayah does not save a Muslim from punishment if he kills, causes mischief in the land or wages war against Allah and His Messenger and then joins rank with the disbelievers, before the Muslims are able to catch him. He will still be liable for punishment for the crimes he committed.'' Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i recorded that `Ikrimah said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÌóÒóÂÁõ ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÍóÇÑöÈõæäó Çááøóåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ æóíóÓúÚóæúäó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö İóÓóÇÏÇğ</div><br>  (The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land...) "Was revealed concerning the idolators, those among them who repent before being apprehended, they will still be liable for punishment for the crimes they committed.'' The correct opinion is that this Ayah is general in meaning and includes the idolators and all others who commit the types of crimes the Ayah mentioned. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Qilabah `Abdullah bin Zayd Al-Jarmi, said that Anas bin Malik said, "Eight people of the `Ukl tribe came to the Messenger of Allah and gave him their pledge to follow Islam. Al-Madinah's climate did not suit them and they became sick and complained to Allah's Messenger . So he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ÊóÎúÑõÌõæäó ãóÚó ÑóÇÚöíäóÇ İöí ÅöÈöáöåö¡ İóÊõÕöíÈõæÇ ãöäú ÃóÈúæóÇáöåóÇ æóÃóáúÈóÇäöåóÇ»</div><br>  (Go with our shephard to be treated by the milk and urine of his camels.) So they went as directed, and after they drank from the camels' milk and urine, they became healthy, and they killed the shepherd and drove away all the camels. The news reached the Prophet and he sent (men) in their pursuit and they were captured. He then ordered that their hands and feet be cut off (and it was done), and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron. Next, they were put in the sun until they died.'' This is the wording of Muslim. In another narration for this Hadith, it was mentioned that these people were from the tribes of `Ukl or `Uraynah. Another narration reported that these people were put in the Harrah area (of Al-Madinah), and when they asked for water, no water was given to them. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä íõŞóÊøóáõæÇú Ãóæú íõÕóáøóÈõæÇú Ãóæú ÊõŞóØøóÚó ÃóíúÏöíåöãú æóÃóÑúÌõáõåõã ãøöäú ÎöáóÜİò Ãóæú íõäİóæúÇú ãöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah, `He who takes up arms in Muslim land and spreads fear in the fairways and is captured, the Muslim Leader has the choice to either have him killed, crucified or cut off his hands and feet.'' Similar was said by Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Mujahid, `Ata', Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Ad-Dahhak, as Abu Ja`far Ibn Jarir recorded. This view is supported by the fact that the word Aw (or), indicates a choice. As Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÌóÒóÂÁñ ãøöËúáõ ãóÇ ŞóÊóáó ãöäó ÇáäøóÚóãö íóÍúßõãõ Èöåö ĞóæóÇ ÚóÏúáò ãøöäúßõãú åóÏúíÇğ ÈóÜáöÛó ÇáúßóÚúÈóÉö Ãóæú ßóİøóÇÑóÉñ ØóÚóÇãõ ãóÓóÜßöíäó Ãóæ ÚóÏúáõ Ğáößó ÕöíóÇãÇğ</div><br>  (The penalty is an offering, brought to the Ka`bah, of an eatable animal equivalent to the one he killed, as adjudged by two just men among you; or, for expiation, he should feed the poor, or its equivalent in fasting.)5:95 Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä ßóÇäó ãöäßõã ãøóÑöíÖğÇ Ãóæú Èöåö ÃóĞğì ãøöä ÑøóÃúÓöåö İóİöÏúíóÉñ ãøöä ÕöíóÇãò Ãóæú ÕóÏóŞóÉò Ãóæú äõÓõßò</div><br>  (And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a ransom of either fasting or giving charity or offering a sacrifice.) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóİøóÇÑóÊõåõ ÅöØúÚóÇãõ ÚóÔóÑóÉö ãóÓóÜßöíäó ãöäú ÃóæúÓóØö ãóÇ ÊõØúÚöãõæäó Ãóåúáöíßõãú Ãóæú ßöÓúæóÊõåõãú Ãóæú ÊóÍúÑöíÑõ ÑóŞóÈóÉò</div><br>  (...for its expiation feed ten of the poor, on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them, or free a slave.) All of these Ayat offer a choice, just as the Ayah above. As for Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú íõäİóæúÇú ãöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (or be exiled from the land.) some said that it means, he is actively pursued until he is captured, and thus receives his prescribed punishment, or otherwise he escapes from the land of Islam, as Ibn Jarir recorded from Ibn `Abbas, Anas bin Malik, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Az-Zuhri, Al-Layth bin Sa`d and Malik bin Anas. Some said that the Ayah means these people are expelled to another land, or to another state by the Muslims authorities. Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Ash-Sha`tha', Al-Hasan, Az-Zuhri, Ad-Dahhak and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that he is expelled, but not outside of the land of Islam, while others said that he is to be imprisoned. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó áóåõãú ÎöÒúìñ İöì ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóáóåõãú İöì ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö ÚóĞóÇÈñ ÚóÙöíãñ</div><br>  (That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.) means, the punishment We prescribed, killing these aggressors, crucifying them, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or expelling them from the land is a disgrace for them among mankind in this life, along with the tremendous torment Allah has prepared for them in the Hereafter. This view supports the opinion that these Ayat were revealed about the idolators. As for Muslims, in his Sahih, Muslim recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said, "The Messenger of Allah took the same pledge from us that he also took from women: That we do not associate anything with Allah in worship, we do not steal, commit adultery, or kill our children, and that we do not spread falsehood about each other. He said that he who keeps this pledge, then his reward will be with Allah. He who falls into shortcomings and was punished, then this will be his expiation. And those whose errors were covered by Allah, then their matter is for Allah: If He wills, He will punish them and If He wills, He will pardon them.'' `Ali narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóĞúäóÈó ĞóäúÈğÇ İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ İóÚõæŞöÈó Èöåö¡ İóÇááåõ ÃóÚúÏóáõ ãöäú Ãóäú íõËóäøöíó ÚõŞõæÈóÊóåõ Úóáì ÚóÈúÏöåö¡ æóãóäú ÃóĞúäóÈó ĞóäúÈğÇ İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ İóÓóÊóÑåõ Çááåõ Úóáóíúåö æóÚóİóÇ Úóäúåõ¡ İóÇááåõ ÃóßúÑóãõ ãöäú Ãóäú íóÚõæÏó Úóáóíúåö İöí ÔóíúÁò ŞóÏú ÚóİóÇ Úóäúå»</div><br>  (He who sins in this life and was punished for it, then Allah is far more just than to combine two punishments on His servant.

This Ayah is clear in its indication that it applies to the idolators. As for the Muslims who commit this crime and repent before they are apprehended, the punishment of killing, crucifixion and cutting the limbs will be waved. The practice of the Companions in this regard is that all of the punishments prescribed in this case will be waved, as is apparent from the wording of the Ayah. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ash-Sha`bi said, "Harithah bin Badr At-Tamimi was living in Al-Basrah, and he committed the crime of mischief in the land. So he talked to some men from Quraysh, such as Al-Hasan bin `Ali, Ibn `Abbas and `Abdullah bin Ja`far, and they talked to `Ali about him so that he would grant him safety, but `Ali refused. So Harithah went to Sa`id bin Qays Al-Hamadani who kept him in his house and went to `Ali, saying, `O Leader of the Faithful! What about those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and cause mischief in the land' So he recited the Ayah until he reached,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóÇÈõæÇú ãöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä ÊóŞúÏöÑõæÇú Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (Except for those who (having fled away and them) came back cas Muslims) with repentance before they fall into your power. ) So `Ali wrote a document that granted safety, and Sa`id bin Qays said, `This is for Harithah bin Badr.''' Ibn Jarir recorded this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, "A man from Murad came to Abu Musa, while he was the governor of Al-Kufah during the reign of `Uthman, and said to him after he offered the obligatory prayer, `O Abu Musa! I seek your help. I am so-and-so from Murad and I waged war against Allah and His Messenger and caused mischief in the land. I repented before you had any authority over me.' Abu Musa proclaimed, `This is so-and-so, who had waged war against Allah and His Messenger and caused mischief in the land, and he repented before we had authority over him. Therefore, anyone who meets him, should deal with him in a better way. If he is saying the truth, then this is the path of those who say the truth. If he is saying a lie, his sins will destroy him. So the man remained idle for as long as Allah willed, but he later rose against the leaders, and Allah punished him for his sins and he was killed.'' Ibn Jarir recorded that Musa bin Ishaq Al-Madani said that `Ali Al-Asadi waged war, blocked the roads, shed blood and plundered wealth. The leaders and the people alike, sought to capture him, but they could not do that until he came after he repented, after he heard a man reciting the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÚöÈóÇÏöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÓúÑóİõæÇú Úóáóì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú áÇó ÊóŞúäóØõæÇú ãöä ÑøóÍúãóÉö Çááøóåö Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóÛúİöÑõ ÇáĞøõäõæÈó ÌóãöíÚÇğ Åöäøóåõ åõæó ÇáúÛóİõæÑõ ÇáÑøóÍöíãõ</div><br>  (O My servants who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) So he said to that man, "O servant of Allah! Recite it again.'' So he recited it again, and `Ali put down his sword and went to Al-Madinah in repentance, arriving during the night. He washed up and went to the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah and prayed the dawn prayer. He sat next to Abu Hurayrah amidst his companions. In the morning, the people recognized him and went after him. He said, "You have no way against me. I came in repentance before you had any authority over me.'' Abu Hurayrah said, "He has said the truth,'' and he held his hand and went to Marwan bin Al-Hakam, who was the governor of Al-Madinah during the reign of Mu`awiyah. Abu Hurayrah said, "This is `Ali and he came in repentance and you do not have a way against him, nor can you have him killed.'' So `Ali was absolved of punishment and remained on his repentance and went to the sea to perform Jihad in Allah's cause. The Muslims met the Romans in battle, and the Muslims brought the ship `Ali was in to one of the Roman ships, and `Ali crossed to that ship and the Romans escaped from him to the other side of the ship, and the ship capsized and they all drowned.''  </div></body></html>
