Hatib was among the Early Emigrants and participated in the battle of Badr. Hatib had children and wealth in Makkah, but he was not from the tribe of Quraysh. Rather, he was an ally of `Uthman. When the Messenger of Allah decided to conquer Makkah, after its people broke the peace treaty between them, he ordered the Muslims to mobilize their forces to attack Makkah, and then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó Úóãøö Úóáóíúåöãú ÎóÈóÑóäóÇ»</div><br>  (O Allah! Keep our news concealed from them.) Hatib wrote a letter and sent it to the people of Makkah, with a woman from the tribe of Quraysh, informing them of the Messenger's intent to attack them. He wanted them to be indebted to him so that they would grant safety to his family in Makkah. Allah the Exalted conveyed this matter to His Messenger , because He accepted the Prophet's invocation to Him to conceal the news of the attack. The Prophet sent someone after the woman and retrieved the letter. This story is collected in the Two Sahihs. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hasan bin Muhammad bin `Ali said that `Abdullah bin Abu Rafi` -- or Ubaydullah bin Abu Rafi` -- said that he heard `Ali say, "Allah's Messenger sent me, Zubayr and Al-Miqdad saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇäúØóáöŞõæÇ ÍóÊúì ÊóÃúÊõæÇ ÑóæúÖóÉó ÎóÇÎò İóÅöäøó ÈöåóÇ ÙóÚöíäóÉğ ãóÚóåóÇ ßöÊóÇÈñ İóÎõĞõæåõ ãöäúåóÇ»</div><br>  (Proceed until you reach Rawdat Khakh, where there is a lady carrying a letter. Take that letter from her.) So we proceeded on our way, with our horses galloping, until we reached the Rawdah. There we found the lady and said to her, `Take out the letter.' She said, `I am not carrying a letter.' We said, `Take out the letter, or else we will take off your clothes.' So she took it out of her braid, and we brought the letter to Allah's Messenger . The letter was addressed from Hatib bin Abu Balta`ah to some pagans of Makkah, telling them about what Allah's Messenger intended to do. Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÍóÇØöÈõ¡ ãóÇ åóĞóÇ¿»</div><br>  (O Hatib! What is this) Hatib replied, `O Allah's Messenger! Do not make a hasty decision about me. I was a person not belonging to Quraysh, but I was an ally to them. All the Emigrants who were with you have kinsmen (in Makkah) who can protect their families. So I wanted to do them a favor, so they might protect my relatives, as I have no blood relation with them. I did not do this out of disbelief or to renegade from my religion, nor did I do it to choose disbelief after Islam.' Allah's Messenger said to his Companions,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóåõ ÕóÏóŞóßõã»</div><br>  (Regarding him, he has told you the truth.) `Umar said, `O Allah's Messenger! Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite!' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóåõ ŞóÏú ÔóåöÏó ÈóÏúÑğÇ¡ æóãóÇ íõÏúÑöíßó áóÚóáøó Çááåó ÇØøóáóÚó Åöáóì Ãóåúáö ÈóÏúÑò İóŞóÇáó:ÇÚúãóáõæÇ ãóÇ ÔöÆúÊõãú İóŞóÏú ÛóİóÑúÊõ áóßõã»</div><br>  (He attended Badr. What can I tell you, perhaps Allah looked at those who attended Badr and said, "O the people of Badr, do what you like, for I have forgiven you.'')'' The Group with the exception of Ibn Majah, collected this Hadith using various chains of narration that included Sufyan bin `Uyaynah. Al-Bukhari added in his narration in the chapter on the Prophet's battles, "Then Allah revealed the Surah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÚóÏõæøöì æóÚóÏõæøóßõãú ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó</div><br>  (O you who believe! Take not my enemies and your enemies as protecting friends...) '' Al-Bukhari said in another part of his Sahih, `Amr (one of the narrators of the Hadith) said, "This Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÚóÏõæøöì æóÚóÏõæøóßõãú ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó</div><br>  (O you who believe! Take not my enemies and your enemies as protecting friends'...) was revealed about Hatib, but I do not know if the Ayah was mentioned in the Hadith (or was added as an explanation by one of the narrators).'' Al-Bukhari also said that `Ali bin Al-Madini said that Sufyan bin `Uyaynah was asked, "Is this why this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÚóÏõæøöì æóÚóÏõæøóßõãú ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó</div><br>  (O you who believe! Take not my enemies and your enemies as protecting friends.) was revealed'' Sufyan said, "This is the narration that I collected from `Amr, I did not leave a letter out of it. I do not know if anyone else memorized the same words for it.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to have Enmity towards the Disbelievers and to abandon supporting Them</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÚóÏõæøöì æóÚóÏõæøóßõãú ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó ÊõáúŞõæäó Åöáóíúåöãú ÈöÇáúãóæóÏøóÉö æóŞóÏú ßóİóÑõæÇú ÈöãóÇ ÌóÂÁóßõãú ãøöäó ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (O you who believe!

It is they whom Allah has decided should be our enemies and should be fought. Allah has forbidden the believers to take them as friends, supporters or companions. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÇáúíóåõæÏó æóÇáäøóÕóÜÑóì ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó ÈóÚúÖõåõãú ÃóæúáöíóÂÁõ ÈóÚúÖò æóãóä íóÊóæóáøóåõãú ãøöäßõãú İóÅöäøóåõ ãöäúåõãú</div><br>  (O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as protecting friends, they are but protecting friends of each other. And if any among you takes them (as such), then surely, he is one of them.) (5:51) This Ayah contains a stern warning and a sure threat. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÊøóÎóĞõæÇú Ïöíäóßõãú åõÒõæÇğ æóáóÚöÈÇğ ãøöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ãöä ŞóÈúáößõãú æóÇáúßõİøóÇÑó ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó Åöä ßõäÊõã ãøõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (O you who believe!

And Allah warns you against Himself (His punishment).) (3:28) This is why Allah's Messenger accepted Hatib's excuse when he said that he only wanted to have a favor on the Quraysh, because of the property and family members he left behind in Makkah. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÎúÑöÌõæäó ÇáÑøóÓõæáó æóÅöíøóÜßõãú</div><br>  (and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves ( from your homeland)) follows His encouragement to fight against them and to avoid being their supporters. This is because they expelled the Messenger and his Companions on account of their hatred for Tawhid and worshipping Allah alone in sincerity. This is why Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä ÊõÄúãöäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö ÑóÈøößõãú</div><br>  (because you believe in Allah, your Lord!) meaning, `your only fault is that you believed in Allah, Lord of all that exists.'

Your relations will not benefit you if you please them with what angers Allah.' Those who agree with their family being disbelievers in order to please them will have earned loss and failure and their deeds will be rendered invalid. Their relation will not benefit them with Allah, even if their relation was with a Prophet. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that a man said, "O Allah's Messenger!
