Whoever does righteous deeds - whether male or female - while he (or she) is a believer; then We will certainly give them a good life, and We will certainly grant them their rewards in proportion to the best of what they used to do.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Righteous Deeds and their Reward</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  This is a promise from Allah to those Children of Adam, male or female, who do righteous deeds - deeds in accordance with the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet , with a heart that believes in Allah and His Messenger , while believing that these deeds are commanded and enjoined by Allah. Allah promises that He will give them a good life in this world and that He will reward them according to the best of their deeds in the Hereafter. The good life includes feeling tranquillity in all aspects of life. It has been reported that Ibn `Abbas and a group (of scholars) interpreted it to mean good, lawful provisions. It was reported that `Ali bin Abi Talib interpreted as contentment. This was also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and Wahb bin Munabbih. `Ali bin Abi Talhah recorded from Ibn `Abbas that it meant happiness. Al-Hasan, Mujahid and Qatadah said: "None gets this good life mentioned except in Paradise.'' Ad-Dahhak said: "It means lawful provisions and worship in this life''. Ad-Dahhak also said: "It means working to obey Allah and finding joy in that.'' The correct view is that a good life includes all of these things. as found in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÏú ÃóİúáóÍó ãóäú ÃóÓúáóãó¡ æóÑõÒöŞó ßóİóÇİğÇ¡ æóŞóäøóÚóåõ Çááåõ ÈöãóÇ ÂÊóÇå»</div><br>  (He who submits becomes a Muslim has succeeded, is given sufficient provisions, and is content with Allah for what he is given.)
