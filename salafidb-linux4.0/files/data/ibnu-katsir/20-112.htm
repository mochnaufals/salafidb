Then, I will be inspired to make praises (of Allah) that I am not able to recall them now. Allah will leave me in this condition as long as He wishes. Then, He will say, "O Muhammad, raise your head. Speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.'' Then, a designated group will be allowed for me (to intercede on their behalf). Allah will then enter them into Paradise and I will return (to repeat the process again). ) The Prophet mentioned doing this four times. May Allah's blessings and peace be upon him and the rest of the Prophets as well. In another Hadith it also mentions that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ ÊóÚóÇáóì: ÃóÎúÑöÌõæÇ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö ãóäú ßóÇäó İöí ŞóáúÈöåö ãöËúŞóÇáõ ÍóÈøóÉò ãöäú ÅöíãóÇäò¡ İóíõÎúÑöÌõæäó ÎóáúŞğÇ ßóËöíÑğÇ¡ Ëõãøó íóŞõæáõ: ÃóÎúÑöÌõæÇ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö ãóäú ßóÇäó İöí ŞóáúÈöåö äöÕúİõ ãöËúŞóÇáò ãöäú ÅöíãóÇäò¡ ÃóÎúÑöÌõæÇ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö ãóäú ßóÇäó İöí ŞóáúÈöåö ãóÇ íóÒöäõ ĞóÑøóÉğ¡ ãóäú ßóÇäó İöí ŞóáúÈöåö ÃóÏúäóì ÃóÏúäóì ãöËúŞóÇáö ĞóÑøóÉò ãöäú ÅöíãóÇä»</div><br>  (Allah, the Exalted, will say, "Bring out of the Fire whoever has a seed's weight of faith in his heart.'' So a large number of people will be brought out. Then He will say, "Bring out of the Fire whoever has a half of a seed's weight of faith in his heart. Bring out whoever has the weight of a speck of dust in his heart. Bring out whoever has the weight of the smallest and tiniest particle of dust of faith in his heart.'') And the Hadith continues. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ Èóíúäó ÃóíúÏöíåöãú æóãóÇ Îóáúİóåõãú</div><br>  (He knows what happens to them and what will happen to them,) He encompasses all creation with His knowledge.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõÍöíØõæäó Èöåö ÚöáúãÇğ</div><br>  (but they will never encompass anything of His knowledge.) This is like His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõÍöíØõæäó ÈöÔóíúÁò ãøöäú Úöáúãöåö ÅöáÇøó ÈöãóÇ ÔóÂÁó</div><br>  (And they will never encompass anything of His knowledge except that which He wills. ) 2:255 Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóäóÊö ÇáúæõÌõæåõ áöáúÍóìøö ÇáúŞóíøõæãö</div><br>  (And (all) faces shall be humbled before the Ever Living, the Sustainer.) Ibn `Abbas and others said, "This means that the creatures will be humbled, submissive and compliant to their Compeller, the Ever Living, Who does not die, the Sustainer of all, Who does not sleep.'' He is the maintainer of everything. He determines the affairs of everything and preserves everything. He is perfect in His Self. He is the One Whom everything is in need of and whom nothing could survive without. Concerning His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÏú ÎóÇÈó ãóäú Íóãóáó ÙõáúãÇğ</div><br>  (And he who carried wrongdoing, will be indeed a complete failure.) meaning on the Day of Resurrection. For verily, Allah will give every due right to the one who deserved it. Even the ram who lost its horn will be given revenge against the one who had horns. In the Sahih, it is recorded that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöíøóÇßõãú æóÇáÙøõáúãó¡ İóÅöäøó ÇáÙøõáúãó ÙõáõãóÇÊñ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (Beware of wrongdoing (or oppression), for verily, wrongdoing will be darknesses on the Day of Resurrection.) And the true failure is for whoever meets Allah while associating partners with Him. Allah the Exalted says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáÔøöÑúßó áóÙõáúãñ ÚóÙöíãñ</div><br>  ("Verily, associating partners with Me is the great wrongdoing.'') Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÚúãóáú ãöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö æóåõæó ãõÄúãöäñ İóáÇó íóÎóÇİõ ÙõáúãÇğ æóáÇó åóÖúãÇğ </div><br>  (And he who works deeds of righteousness, while he is a believer, then he will have no fear of injustice, nor of any curtailment.) After Allah mentions the wrongdoers and their threat, He then commends the pious people and mentions the judgement they receive. Their judgement is that they will not be wronged nor oppressed. This means that their evils will not be increased and their good deeds will not be decreased. This was stated by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others. Zulm means an increase that comes from the sins of others being placed upon the person, and Hadm means a decrease.  </div></body></html>
