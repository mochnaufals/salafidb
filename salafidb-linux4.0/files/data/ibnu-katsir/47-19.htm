They used to sit before Allah's Messenger and listen to his words without understanding anything. Then when they left from his presence,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú áöáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúÚöáúãó</div><br>  (they say to those who have received knowledge) from the Companions   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇĞóÇ ŞóÇáó ÁóÇäöİÇğ</div><br>  ("What is it that he has said just now'') meaning, at this moment. They did not understand what he said, nor did they care about it. Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÇáøóĞöíäó ØóÈóÚó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú æóÇÊøóÈóÚõæÇú ÃóåúæóÂÁóåõãú</div><br>  (Such are the men whose hearts Allah has sealed because they followed their lusts.) which means that they had neither sound understanding nor correct intentions. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÇåúÊóÏóæúÇú ÒóÇÏóåõãú åõÏğì</div><br>  (And as for those who accept guidance, He increases them in guidance) which means that those who seek guidance, Allah facilitates it for them; He guides them to it, makes them firm on it, and gives them more of it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóÜåõãú ÊóŞõæóÇåõãú</div><br>  (and bestows on them their Taqwa. ) meaning, He inspires them to their righteous guidance. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóáú íóäÙõÑõæäó ÅöáÇøó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉó Ãóä ÊóÃúÊöíóåõãú ÈóÛúÊóÉğ</div><br>  (Do they then await except that the Hour should come upon them suddenly) meaning, while they are unaware of it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁó ÃóÔúÑóÇØõåóÇ</div><br>  (But already there have come (some of) its portents;) meaning, the signs of its approach. This is similar to Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ äóĞöíÑñ ãøöäó ÇáäøõĞõÑö ÇáÇøòæúáóì - ÃóÒöİóÊö ÇáÇøñÒöİóÉõ </div><br>  (This is a warner of the warners of old. The approaching Day has drawn near.) (53:56-57) And His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÊóÑóÈóÊö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ æóÇäÔóŞøó ÇáúŞóãóÑõ </div><br>  (The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has split.) (54:1) And His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊóì ÃóãúÑõ Çááøóåö İóáÇó ÊóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõæåõ</div><br>  (The command of Allah is coming, so do not be impatient for it.) (16:1) And His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÊóÑóÈó áöáäøóÇÓö ÍöÓóÜÈõåõãú æóåõãú İöì ÛóİúáóÉò ãøõÚúÑöÖõæäó </div><br>  (The people's Day of Reckoning has approached while they turn away in heedlessness.) (21:1) Thus, the Messenger's advent is one of the signs of the Hour, because he is the Finality of the Messengers. With him, Allah has completed the religion and established the evidence against all people in a way that was never done by a previous Prophet. Allah's Messenger has most clearly informed about the signs and indications of the Hour, as we have discussed elsewhere.  Al-Bukhari recorded from Sahl bin Sa`d, may Allah be pleased with him, that he saw Allah's Messenger bring his index and middle fingers together while he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈõÚöËúÊõ ÃóäóÇ æóÇáÓøóÇÚóÉó ßóåóÇÊóíúä»</div><br>  (I have been sent before the Hour as these two (fingers).) Allah continues,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóäøóì áóåõãú ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ĞößúÑóÇåõãú</div><br>  (and when it (actually) is on them, how can they benefit then by their reminder) meaning, how would remembering benefit the disbelievers when the Hour comes upon them This is similar to Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãóÆöĞò íóÊóĞóßøóÑõ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ æóÃóäøóì áóåõ ÇáĞøößúÑóì</div><br>  (On that Day will the human being remember, but what would that remembrance avail him then) (89:23) And His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Èöåö æóÃóäøóì áóåõãõ ÇáÊøóäóÇæõÔõ ãöä ãøóßóÇäö ÈóÚöíÏò </div><br>  (They will say (in the Hereafter): "Now we believe in it!'' But how could they claim belief from such a far place) (34:52) Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúáóãú Ãóäøóåõ áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÃÇááøóåö</div><br>  (So know that La ilaha illallah) This is a declaration that there is no true God except Allah. It is not something that is easy for him to command the people to have knowledge of. That is why Allah connected it with,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúÊóÛúİöÑú áöĞóäÈößó æóáöáúãõÄúãöäöíäó æóÇáúãõÄúãöäóÜÊö</div><br>  (and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and women.) In the Sahih, it is recorded that Allah's Messenger used to say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó ÇÛúİöÑú áöí ÎóØöíÆóÊöí æóÌóåúáöí æóÅöÓúÑóÇİöí İöí ÃóãúÑöí æóãóÇ ÃóäúÊó ÃóÚúáóãõ Èöåö ãöäøöí¡ Çááúåõãøó ÇÛúİöÑú áöí åóÒúáöí æóÌöÏøöí¡ æóÎóØóÆöí æóÚóãúÏöí¡ æóßõáøõ Ğáößó ÚöäúÏöí»</div><br>  (O Allah, forgive my sin, my ignorance, my immoderation in my affairs, and all that You know better about my (faults) than myself. O Allah, forgive for me my joking, my seriousness, my unintended error, and my deliberate (mistakes) -- and I have done of all that.) It is also reported in the Sahih that he used to say at the end of the prayer,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó ÇÛúİöÑú áöí ãóÇ ŞóÏøóãúÊõ æóãóÇ ÃóÎøóÑúÊõ¡ æóãóÇ ÃóÓúÑóÑúÊõ æóãóÇ ÃóÚúáóäúÊõ¡ æóãóÇ ÃóÓúÑóİúÊõ¡ æóãóÇ ÃóäúÊó ÃóÚúáóãõ Èöåö ãöäøöí¡ ÃóäúÊó Åöáåöí áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ ÃóäúÊ»</div><br>  (O Allah, forgive for me what I have previously done, what I may commit in future, what I have committed secretly, what I have committed openly, what I have done excessively, and all sins that You know better than me. You are my God. There is no (true) God except You.) It is also recorded in the Sahih that he used to say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÊõæÈõæÇ Åöáóì ÑóÈøößõãú¡ İóÅöäøöí ÃóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõ Çááåó æóÃóÊõæÈõ Åöáóíúåö İöí Çáúíóæúãö ÃóßúËóÑó ãöäú ÓóÈúÚöíäó ãóÑøóÉ»</div><br>  (O people! Repent to your Lord! Verily, I ask Allah for forgiveness and repent to Him more than seventy times every day.) Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóÚúáóãõ ãõÊóŞóáøóÈóßõãú æóãóËúæóÇßõãú</div><br>  (And Allah knows well your moving about, and your place of rest.) means, He knows how you behave during the day, and where you settle at night. This is similar to His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íóÊóæóİøóÜßõã ÈöÇáøóíúáö æóíóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ ÌóÑóÍúÊõã ÈöÇáäøóåóÇÑö</div><br>  (It is He Who takes your souls by night and knows all that you do by day.)(6:60) And He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ãöä ÏóÂÈøóÉò İöí ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöáÇøó Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÑöÒúŞõåóÇ æóíóÚúáóãõ ãõÓúÊóŞóÑøóåóÇ æóãõÓúÊóæúÏóÚóåóÇ ßõáøñ İöì ßöÊóÇÈò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  (And there is no moving creature on earth but its provision is up to Allah, and He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (before birth and after death) -- all is in a clear register.)
