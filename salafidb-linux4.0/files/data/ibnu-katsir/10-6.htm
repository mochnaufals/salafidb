He made the rays that come forth from the bright sun as the source of light, and made the beams that come forth from the moon as light. He made them of two different natures so they would not be confused with one another. Allah made the dominion of the sun in the daytime and the moon in the night. He ordained phases for the moon, where it starts small then its light increases until it completes a full moon. Then it begins to decrease until it returns to its first phase at the conclusion of the month. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúŞóãóÑó ŞóÏøóÑúäóÜåõ ãóäóÇÒöáó ÍóÊøóì ÚóÇÏó ßóÇáÚõÑÌõæäö ÇáúŞóÏöíãö - áÇó ÇáÔøóãúÓõ íóäÈóÛöì áóåóÂ Ãóä ÊÏúÑößó ÇáŞóãóÑó æóáÇó Çáøóíúáõ ÓóÇÈöŞõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑö æóßõáøñ İöì İóáóßò íóÓúÈóÍõæäó </div><br>  (And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk. It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit.) (36:39-40) And He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÔøóãúÓó æóÇáúŞóãóÑó ÍõÓúÈóÇäÇğ</div><br>  (And the sun and the moon for counting) And in this Ayah He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÏøóÑóåõ</div><br>  (and measured) that is the moon, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóäóÇÒöáó áöÊóÚúáóãõæÇú ÚóÏóÏó ÇáÓøöäöíäó æóÇáúÍöÓóÇÈó</div><br>  (And measured out for it stages that you might know the number of years and the reckoning. '') The days are revealed by the action of the sun, and the months and the years by the moon. Allah then stated   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ÎóáóŞó Çááøóåõ Ğóáößó ÅöáÇøó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (Allah did not create this but in truth.) He didn't create that for amusement but with great wisdom and perfect reasoning. With a similar meaning, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÂÁó æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó æóãóÇ ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ ÈóÜØöáÇğ Ğóáößó Ùóäøõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú İóæóíúáñ áøöáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö </div><br>  (And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) (38:27) He also said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÍóÓöÈúÊõãú ÃóäøóãóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÜßõãú ÚóÈóËÇğ æóÃóäøóßõãú ÅöáóíúäóÇ áÇó ÊõÑúÌóÚõæäó - İóÊóÚóÜáóì Çááøóåõ Çáúãóáößõ ÇáúÍóŞøõ áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚóÑúÔö ÇáúßóÑöíãö </div><br>  ("Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us'' So Exalted be Allah, the True King: None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) 23:115-116 Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõİóÕøöáõ ÇáÂíóÜÊö áöŞóæúãò íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (He explains the Ayat in detail for people who have knowledge.) In other words, He explained the signs and proofs for people who know. Allah further stated:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì ÇÎúÊöáóÜİö Çáøóíúáö æóÇáäøóåóÇÑö</div><br>  (Verily, in the alternation of the night and the day) The day and the night alternate, when one arrives, the other goes, and so on, with no errors. This is similar to the meaning indicated in the following Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÛúÔöì Çáøóíúáó ÇáäøóåóÇÑó íóØúáõÈõåõ ÍóËöíËğÇ</div><br>  (He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly...).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÇáÔøóãúÓõ íóäÈóÛöì áóåóÂ Ãóä ÊÏúÑößó ÇáŞóãóÑó</div><br>  (It is not for the sun to overtake the moon.) 36:40, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇáöŞõ ÇáÅöÕúÈóÇÍö æóÌóÚóáó Çáøóíúáó ÓóßóäÇğ</div><br>  ((He is the) Cleaver of the daybreak.
