Therefore, Allah revealed this verse.'' Al-Bukhari recorded by way of Ibn Jurayj, who reported from Muhammad bin `Abbad bin Ja`far who said, "Ibn `Abbas recited, (ÃóáóÇ Åöäøóåõãú ÊóËúäóæäöí ÕõÏõæÑõåõãú) "Behold their breasts did fold up.'' So I said: `O Abu Al-`Abbas! What does -their breasts did fold up- mean' He said, `The man used to have sex with his woman, but he would be shy, or he used to have answering the call of nature (in an open space) but, he would be shy. Therefore, this verse,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇ Åöäøóåõãú íóËúäõæäó ÕõÏõæÑóåõãú</div><br>  (No doubt! They did fold up their breasts,) was revealed.''' In another wording of this narration, Ibn `Abbas said, "There were people who used to be shy to remove their clothes while answering the call of nature in an open space and thus be naked exposed to the sky. They were also ashamed of having sexual relations with their women due to fear of being exposed towards the sky. Thus, this was revealed concerning them.'' Al-Bukhari reported that Ibn `Abbas said that   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÊóÛúÔõæäó</div><br>  (they cover themselves) means that they cover their heads.  </div></body></html>
