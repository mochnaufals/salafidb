The Masjids are His houses where He Alone is worshipped. So Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÈõíõæÊò ÃóĞöäó Çááøóåõ Ãóä ÊõÑúİóÚó</div><br>  (In houses which Allah has ordered to be raised,) meaning, Allah has commanded that they be established and that they be kept clean of any filth, idle talk or words or deeds that are inappropriate. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning this Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÈõíõæÊò ÃóĞöäó Çááøóåõ Ãóä ÊõÑúİóÚó</div><br>  (In houses which Allah has ordered to be raised,) he said; "Allah forbade idle talk in them.'' This was also the view of `Ikrimah, Abu Salih, Ad-Dahhak, Nafi` bin Jubayr, Abu Bakr bin Sulayman bin Abi Hathamah, Sufyan bin Husayn and others among the scholars of Tafsir. Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the construction of Masjids, honoring them, respecting them, and perfuming them with incense etc. This has been discussed in more detail elsewhere, and I have written a book dealing with this topic on its own, praise and blessings be to Allah. With Allah's help we will mention here a few of these Hadiths, if Allah wills. In Allah we put our trust and reliance. `Uthman bin `Affan, the Commander of the faithful, may Allah be pleased with him, said; "I heard the Messenger of Allah say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Èóäóì ãóÓúÌöÏğÇ íóÈúÊóÛöí Èöåö æóÌúåó Çááåö Èóäóì Çááåõ áóåõ ãöËúáóåõ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö»</div><br>  (Whoever builds a Masjid seeking the Face of Allah, Allah will build for him something similar to it in Paradise.) It was narrated in the Two Sahihs. Ibn Majah narrated that `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said; "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Èóäóì ãóÓúÌöÏğÇ íõĞúßóÑõ İöíåö ÇÓúãõ Çááåö Èóäóì Çááåõ áóåõ ÈóíúÊğÇ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö»</div><br>  (Whoever builds a Masjid in which the Name of Allah is remembered, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise.) An-Nasa'i mentioned something similar. There are very many Hadiths which say this. `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of Allah commanded us to build Masjids among the houses, and to clean them and perfume them.'' This was recorded by Ahmad and the Sunan compilers with the exception of An-Nasa'i. Ahmad and Abu Dawud recorded a similar report from Samurah bin Jundub.Al-Bukhari said: "`Umar said: `Build for the people a place to worship Allah, and beware of using red or yellow for adornment and decoration and distracting the people thereby.''' Abu Dawud narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÃõãöÑúÊõ ÈöÊóÔúíöíÏö ÇáúãóÓóÇÌöÏö»</div><br>  (I was not commanded to Tashyid the Masjids.) Ibn `Abbas said, "Decorating them as the Jews and Christians did.'' Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóŞõæãõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ÍóÊøóì íóÊóÈóÇåóì ÇáäøóÇÓõ İöí ÇáúãóÓóÇÌöÏö»</div><br>  (The Hour will not come until people show off in building Masjids.) It was recorded by Ahmad and the compilers of the Sunan, with the exception of At-Tirmidhi.Buraydah narrated that a man called out in the Masjid and said, "Has any body said anything about a red camel'' The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ¡ æóÌóÏúÊó¡ ÅöäøóãóÇ ÈõäöíóÊö ÇáúãóÓóÇÌöÏõ áöãóÇ ÈõäöíóÊú áóåõ»</div><br>  (May you never find it! The Masjids were built only for what they were built for.) This was narrated by Muslim. Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóíúÊõãú ãóäú íóÈöíÚõ Ãóæú íóÈúÊóÇÚõ İöí ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏö¡ İóŞõæáõæÇ: áóÇ ÃóÑúÈóÍó Çááåõ ÊöÌóÇÑóÊóßó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóíúÊõãú ãóäú íóäúÔõÏõ ÖóÇáøóÉğ İöí ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏö İóŞõæáõæÇ: áóÇ ÑóÏøóåóÇ Çááåõ Úóáóíúßó»</div><br>  (If you see someone buying or selling in the Masjid, say to him, "May Allah never make your business profitable!'' And if you see someone calling out about lost property, say, "May Allah never return it to you!'') This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said: "Hasan Gharib.'' Al-Bukhari recorded that As-Sa'ib bin Yazid Al-Kindi said, "I was standing in the Masjid and a man threw pebbles at me, so I looked and saw `Umar bin Al-Khattab who said, `Go and bring me these two men.' I went and brought them to him, and he said, `Who are you' Or, `Where do you come from' They said, `We are from At-Ta'if.' `Umar said, `If you had been from this town I would have hit you, for you are raising your voices in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah .''' An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibrahim bin `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: "`Umar heard the voice of a man in the Masjid and said: `Do you know where you are''' This is also Sahih. Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Musili recorded from Ibn `Umar that `Umar used to burn incense in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah every Friday. Its chain of narration is Hasan and there is nothing wrong with it, Allah knows best. It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáÑøóÌõáö İöí ÇáúÌóãóÇÚóÉö ÊõÖóÚøóİõ Úóáóì ÕóáóÇÊöåö İöí ÈóíúÊöåö æóİöí ÓõæŞöåö ÎóãúÓğÇ æóÚöÔúÑöíäó ÖöÚúİğÇæóĞóáößó Ãóäøóåõ ÅóĞóÇ ÊóæóÖøóÃó İóÃóÍúÓóäó æõÖõæÁóåõ Ëõãøó ÎóÑóÌó Åöáóì ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏö áóÇ íõÎúÑöÌõåõ ÅöáøóÇ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉõ áóãú íóÎúØõ ÎóØúæóÉğ ÅöáøóÇ ÑõİöÚó áóåõ ÈöåóÇ ÏóÑóÌóÉñ æóÍõØøó Úóäúåõ ÈöåóÇ ÎóØöíÆóÉñ.

That is because if he performs Wudu' and does it well, then he goes out to go to the Masjid, and for no other purpose than to pray, he does not take one step but he increases in one level in status and one sin is removed. When he prays, the angels continue sending blessings on him as long as he is in the place where he prays, they say, "O Allah, send blessings on him, O Allah, have mercy on him.'' And he will remain in a state of prayer as long as he is waiting for the prayer.) The following is recorded in the Sunan:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóÔøöÑö ÇáúãóÔøóÇÆöíäó Åöáóì ÇáúãóÓóÇÌöÏö İöí ÇáÙøõáóãö ÈöÇáäøõæÑö ÇáÊøóÇãøö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö»</div><br>  (Those who walk to the Masjids when it is dark, give them the glad tidings of complete Light on the Day of Resurrection.) When entering the Masjid, it is recommended to enter with one's right foot, and to say the supplication recorded in Sahih Al-Bukhari, where it is narrated from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah used to say, when he entered the Masjid:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÚõæĞõ ÈöÇááåö ÇáúÚóÙöíãö æóÈöæóÌúåöåö ÇáúßóÑöíãö¡ æóÓõáúØóÇäöåö ÇáúŞóÏöíãö¡ ãöäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäö ÇáÑøóÌöíãö»</div><br>  (I seek refuge with Allah Almighty and with His Noble Face, and with His Eternal Domain, from the accursed Shaytan.) He (one of the narrators) asked, `Is that all' He answered, `Yes'. If he says this, the Shaytan says: "He will be protected from me all day long.'' Muslim recorded that Abu Humayd or Abu Usayd said: The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÏóÎóáó ÃóÍóÏõßõãõ ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏó İóáúíóŞõáú: Çááøóåõãøó ÇİúÊóÍú áöí ÃóÈúæóÇÈó ÑóÍúãóÊößó.æóÅöĞóÇ ÎóÑóÌó İóáúíóŞõáú: Çááøóåõãøó Åöäøöí ÃóÓúÃóáõßó ãöäú İóÖúáößó»</div><br>  (When anyone of you enters the Masjid, let him say: "O Allah, open the gates of Your mercy for me. And when he comes out, let him say: "O Allah, I ask You of Your bounty.'') An-Nasa'i also recorded this from them from the Prophet . Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÏóÎóáó ÃóÍóÏõßõãõ ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏó İóáúíõÓóáøöãú Úóáóì ÇáäøóÈöíøö. æóáúíóŞõáö: Çááøóåõãøó ÇİúÊóÍú áöí ÃóÈúæóÇÈó ÑóÍúãóÊößó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÎóÑóÌó İóáúíõÓóáøöãú Úóáóì ÇáäøóÈöíøö æóáúíóŞõáö: Çááøóåõãøó ÇÚúÕöãúäöí ãöäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäö ÇáÑøóÌöíãö»</div><br>  (When anyone of you enters the Masjid, let him invoke blessings on the Prophet then let him say: "O Allah, open the gates of Your mercy for me.'' When he comes out, let him invoke blessings on the Prophet and say, "O Allah, protect me from the accursed Shaytan.'')

When the call is proclaimed for the Salah on Friday, hasten earnestly to the remembrance of Allah and leave off business.) 62:9 Allah says that this world and its adornments, attractions and marketplaces should not distract them from remembering their Lord Who created them and sustains them, those who know that what is with Him is better for them than what they themselves possess, because what they have is transient but that which is with Allah is eternal. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó Êõáúåöíåöãú ÊöÌóÜÑóÉñ æóáÇó ÈóíúÚñ Úóä ĞößúÑö Çááøóåö æóÅöŞóÇãö ÇáÕøóáóæÉö æóÅöíÊóÂÁö ÇáÒøóßóÜæÉö</div><br>  (Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah nor from performing the Salah nor from giving the Zakah). meaning, they give priority to obeying Allah and doing what He wants and what pleases Him over doing what they want and what pleases them. It was reported from Salim from `Abdullah bin `Umar that he was in the marketplace when the Iqamah for prayer was called, so they closed their stores and entered the Masjid. Ibn `Umar said: "Concerning them the Ayah was revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑöÌóÇáñ áÇøó Êõáúåöíåöãú ÊöÌóÜÑóÉñ æóáÇó ÈóíúÚñ Úóä ĞößúÑö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Men whom neither trade nor business diverts from the remembrance of Allah).''

This was also the view of Muqatil bin Hayyan and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. As-Suddi said: "From prayer in congregation.'' Muqatil bin Hayyan said, "That does not distract them from attending the prayer and establishing it as Allah commanded them, and from doing the prayers at the prescribed times and doing all that Allah has enjoined upon them in the prayer.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÎóÜİõæäó íóæúãÇğ ÊóÊóŞóáøóÈõ İöíåö ÇáúŞõáõæÈõ æóÇáÇøñÈúÕóÜÑõ</div><br>  (They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned.) means, the Day of Resurrection when people's hearts and eyes will be overturned, because of the intensity of the fear and terror of that Day.
