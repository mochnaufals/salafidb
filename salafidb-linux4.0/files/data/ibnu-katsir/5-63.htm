Therefore, the meaning of this part of the Ayah is: we also believe that most of you are rebellious and deviated from the straight path. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The People of the Scriptures Deserve the Worst Torment on the Day of Resurrection</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åóáú ÃõäóÈøöÆõßõãú ÈöÔóÑøò ãøöä Ğáößó ãóËõæÈóÉğ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Say: "Shall I inform you of something worse than that, regarding the recompense from Allah") The Ayah commands the Prophet to say: Shall I inform you about a worse people with Allah on the Day of Resurrection than what you think of us They are you, with these characteristics,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä áøóÚóäóåõ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (those who incurred the curse of Allah) were expelled from His mercy,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÛóÖöÈó Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (and who incurred His wrath) and anger, after which He will never be pleased with them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáó ãöäúåõãõ ÇáúŞöÑóÏóÉó æóÇáúÎóäóÇÒöíÑó</div><br>  (those of whom He transformed into monkeys and swine,) as we mentioned in Surat Al-Baqarah (2) and as we will mention in Surat Al-A`raf (7).

The monkeys and swine existed before that.)'' This was also recorded by Muslim. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóÈóÏó ÇáØøóÜÛõæÊó</div><br>  (Those who worshipped Taghut...) and served them, becoming their servants. The meaning of this Ayah is: you, O People of the Scriptures, who mock our religion, which consists of Allah's Tawhid, and singling Him out in worship without others, how can you mock us while these are your characteristics This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÔóÑøñ ãøóßóÇäÇğ</div><br>  (such are worse in rank...) than what you -- People of the Scriptures -- think of us Muslims,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÖóáøõ Úóä ÓóæóÂÁö ÇáÓøóÈöíáö</div><br>  (and far more astray from the straight path.) `More' in the Ayah does not mean that the other party is `less' astray, but it means that the People of the Scriptures are far astray. In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö íóæúãóÆöĞò ÎóíúÑñ ãøõÓúÊóŞóÑøÇğ æóÃóÍúÓóäõ ãóŞöíáÇğ </div><br>  (The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Hypocrites Pretend to be Believers but Hide their Kufr</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁõæßõãú ŞóÇáõæÇú ÁóÇãóäøóÇ æóŞóÏú ÏøóÎóáõæÇú ÈöÇáúßõİúÑö æóåõãú ŞóÏú ÎóÑóÌõæÇú Èöåö</div><br>  (When they come to you, they say, "We believe.'' But in fact they enter with (an intention of) disbelief and they go out with the same.) This is the description of the hypocrites, for they pretend to be believers while their hearts hide Kufr. So Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÏú ÏøóÎóáõæÇú</div><br>  (But in fact they enter) on you, O Muhammad,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÇáúßõİúÑö</div><br>  (with disbelief) in their hearts and they depart with Kufr, and this is why they do not benefit from the knowledge they hear from you, nor does the advice and reminder move them. So,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú ŞóÏú ÎóÑóÌõæÇú Èöåö</div><br>  (and they go out with the same) meaning, they alone,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóßúÊõãõæäó</div><br>  (and Allah knows all that they were hiding.) Allah knows their secrets and what their hearts conceal, even if they pretend otherwise with His creatures, thus pretending to be what they are not. Allah, Who has perfect knowledge of the seen and unseen, has more knowledge about the hypocrites than any of His creatures do and He will recompense them accordingly. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóì ßóËöíÑÇğ ãøöäúåõãú íõÓóÜÑöÚõæäó İöì ÇáÅöËúãö æóÇáúÚõÏúæóÇäö æóÃóßúáöåöãõ ÇáÓøõÍúÊó</div><br>  (And you see many of them (Jews) hurrying for sin and transgression, and eating illegal things.)

Indeed, horrible is that which they used to do and the transgression that they committed. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Criticizing Rabbis and Learned Religious Men for Giving up on Forbidding Evil</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæúáÇó íóäúåóÜåõãõ ÇáÑøóÈøóÜäöíøõæäó æóÇáÇøñÍúÈóÇÑõ Úóä Şóæúáöåöãõ ÇáÅöËúãó æóÃóßúáöåöãõ ÇáÓøõÍúÊó áóÈöÆúÓó ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÕúäóÚõæäó </div><br>  (Why do not the Rabbaniyyun and the Ahbar forbid them from uttering sinful words and from eating illegal things.

Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "There is no Ayah in the Qur'an that has more severe admonition than this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæúáÇó íóäúåóÜåõãõ ÇáÑøóÈøóÜäöíøõæäó æóÇáÇøñÍúÈóÇÑõ Úóä Şóæúáöåöãõ ÇáÅöËúãó æóÃóßúáöåöãõ ÇáÓøõÍúÊó áóÈöÆúÓó ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÕúäóÚõæäó </div><br>  (Why do not the Rabbaniyyun and the Ahbar forbid them from uttering sinful words and from eating illegal things. Evil indeed is that which they have been performing.)'' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Yahya bin Ya`mar said, " `Ali bin Abi Talib once gave a speech, which he started by praising Allah and thanking Him. He then said, `O people! Those who were before you were destroyed because they committed sins and the Rabbaniyyun and Ahbar did not forbid them from evil. When they persisted in sin, they were overcome by punishment. Therefore, enjoin righteousness and forbid evil before what they suffered also strikes you. Know that enjoining righteousness and forbidding evil does not reduce the provision or shorten the term of life.'' Imam Ahmad recorded that Jarir said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú Şóæúãò íóßõæäõ Èóíúäó ÃóÙúåõÑöåöãú ãóäú íóÚúãóáõ ÈöÇáúãóÚóÇÕöí åõãú ÃóÚóÒøõ ãöäúåõ æóÃóãúäóÚõ¡ æóáóãú íõÛóíøöÑõæÇ ÅöáøóÇ ÃóÕóÇÈóåõãõ Çááåõ ãöäúåõ ÈöÚóĞóÇÈ»</div><br>  (There is no people among whom there are those who commit sins, while the rest are more powerful and mightier than the sinners, yet they do not stop them, but Allah will send a punishment upon them.) Ahmad was alone with this wording. Abu Dawud recorded it, but in his narration Jarir said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú ÑóÌõáò íóßõæäõ İöí Şóæúãò íõÚúãóáõ İöíåöãú ÈöÇáúãóÚóÇÕöí¡ íóŞúÏöÑõæäó Ãóäú íõÛóíøöÑõæÇ Úóáóíúåö¡ İóáóÇ íõÛóíøöÑõæÇ ÅöáøóÇ ÃóÕóÇÈóåõãõ Çááåõ ÈöÚöŞóÇÈò ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú íóãõæÊõæÇ»</div><br>  (There is no one who resides among people commiting evil among them, and they do not stop him though they are able to do so, but Allah will punish them all before they die.)''  Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith.  </div></body></html>
