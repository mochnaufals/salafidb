Also, Abu Hurayrah, Abu Wa'il, `Ata', and Al-Hasan said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÍóÜØóÊú Èöåö ÎóØöíÜóÜÊõåõ</div><br>  (And his sin has surrounded him) means, "His Shirk (polytheism) has surrounded him.''

As-Suddi and Abu Razin said similarly. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÍóÜØóÊú Èöåö ÎóØöíÜóÜÊõåõ</div><br>  (And his sin has surrounded him) refers to major sins. All of these statements carry similar meanings, and Allah knows best. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>When Small Sins gather, They bring about Destruction</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Here we should mention the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded, in which `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöíøóÇßõãú æóãõÍóŞøóÑóÇÊö ÇáĞøõäõæÈö İóÅöäøóåõäøó íóÌúÊóãöÚúäó Úóáóì ÇáÑøóÌõáö ÍóÊøì íõåúáößúäóå»</div><br>  (Beware of the belittled sins, because they gather on a person until they destroy him.)
