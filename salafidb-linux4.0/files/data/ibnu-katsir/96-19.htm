A servant when he prays) This was revealed about Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him. He threatened the Prophet for performing Salah at the Ka`bah. Thus, Allah firstly admonished him with that which was better by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÑóÁóíúÊó Åöä ßóÇäó Úóáóì ÇáúåõÏóì </div><br>  (Have you seen if he is on the guidance.) meaning, `do you think this man whom you are preventing is upon the straight path in his action, or   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÃóãóÑó ÈöÇáÊøóŞúæóì </div><br>  (Or enjoins Taqwa) in his statements Yet, you rebuke him and threaten him due to his prayer.' Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú íóÚúáóã ÈöÃóäøó Çááøóåó íóÑóì </div><br>  (Knows he not that Allah sees) meaning, doesn't this person who is preventing this man who is following correct guidance know that Allah sees him and hears his words, and He will compensate him in full for what he has done Then Allah says by way of warning and threatening,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó áóÆöä áøóãú íóäÊóåö</div><br>  (Nay!

This is so that he may know who will win -- Our group or his group' Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "Abu Jahl said, `If I see Muhammad praying at the Ka`bah, I will stomp on his neck.' So this reached the Prophet , who said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÆöäú İóÚóáó áóÃóÎóĞóÊúåõ ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉ»</div><br>  (If he does, he will be seized by the angels.)'' This Hadith was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in their Books of Tafsir. Likewise, it has been recorded by Ibn Jarir. Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Jarir, all recorded it from Ibn `Abbas with the following wording: "The Messenger of Allah was praying at the Maqam (prayer station of Ibrahim) when Abu Jahl bin Hisham passed by him and said, `O Muhammad! Haven't I prevented you from this' He threatened the Prophet and thus, the Messenger of Allah became angry with him and reprimanded him. Then he said, `O Muhammad! What can you threaten me with By Allah, I have the most kinsmen of this valley with me in the large.' Then Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáúíóÏúÚõ äóÇÏöíóåõ - ÓóäóÏúÚõ ÇáÒøóÈóÇäöíóÉó </div><br>  (Then let him call upon his council. We will call out the guards of Hell!)'' Ibn `Abbas then said, "If he had called his people, the angels of torment would have seized him at that very instant.'' At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih.''  Ibn Jarir recorded from Abu Hurayrah that Abu Jahl said, "Does Muhammad cover his face with dust (i.e., from prostration) while he is among you all'' They (the people) replied, "Yes.'' Then he said, "By Al-Lat and Al-`Uzza, if I see him praying like this, I will stomp on his neck, and I will certainly put his face in the dust.'' So the Messenger of Allah came and he began praying, which made it possible for Abu Jahl to stomp on his neck. Then the people became surprised at him (Abu Jahl) because he began retreating on his heels and covering himself with his hands. Then it was said to him, "What's the matter with you'' He replied, "Verily, between me and him is a ditch of fire, monsters and wings.'' Then the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú ÏóäóÇ ãöäøöí áóÇÎúÊóØóİóÊúåõ ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉõ ÚõÖúæğÇ ÚõÖúæğÇ»</div><br>  (If he had come near me, the angels would have snatched him limb by limb.) The narrator added; "Allah revealed an Ayah, but I do not know whether it is concerning the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah or not:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó Åöäøó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó áóíóØúÛóì </div><br>  (Nay! Verily, man does transgress.) to the end of the Surah.'' Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, Muslim, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Abi Hatim all recorded this Hadith. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Amusement for the Prophet</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó áÇó ÊõØöÚúåõ</div><br>  (Nay! Do not obey him.) meaning, `O Muhammad! Do not obey him in what he is forbidding from such as steadfastness in worship and performing worship in abundance. Pray wherever you wish and do not worry about him. For indeed Allah will protect you and help you, and He will defend you against the people.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúÌõÏú æóÇŞúÊóÑöÈ</div><br>  (Fall prostrate and draw near (to Allah)!) This is just like what has been confirmed in the Sahih of Muslim on the authority of Abu Salih who reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóŞúÑóÈõ ãóÇ íóßõæäõ ÇáúÚóÈúÏõ ãöäú ÑóÈøöåö æóåõæó ÓóÇÌöÏñ¡ İóÃóßúËöÑõæÇ ÇáÏøõÚóÇÁ»</div><br>  (The closest that a servant can be to his Lord is when he is in prostration. Therefore, make abundant supplications (i.e., while prostrating).)'' It has also been mentioned previously that the Messenger of Allah used to prostrate when he recited   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÂÁõ ÇäÔóŞøóÊú </div><br>  (When the heaven is split asunder.) (84:1) and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÑóÃú ÈöÇÓúãö ÑóÈøößó ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó </div><br>  (Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created.) (96:1) This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Iqra' (Surat Al-`Alaq). Unto Allah is due all praise and thanks, and He is the Giver of success and protection against error.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
