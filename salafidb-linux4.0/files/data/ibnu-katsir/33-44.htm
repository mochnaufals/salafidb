Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Busr said: "Two bedouins came to the Messenger of Allah and one of them said: `O Messenger of Allah, which of the people is best' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ØóÇáó ÚõãúÑõåõ æóÍóÓõäó Úóãóáõå»</div><br>  (The one whose life is long and whose deeds are good.) The other one said: `O Messenger of Allah, the laws of Islam are too much for us. Teach me something that I can adhere to.' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇíóÒóÇáõ áöÓóÇäõßó ÑóØúÈğÇ ÈöĞößúÑö Çááåö ÊóÚóÇáóì»</div><br>  (Keep your tongue moist with the remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted.) At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah recorded the second part of this report. At-Tirmidhi said, "This Hadith is Hasan Gharib''. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú Şóæúãò ÌóáóÓõæÇ ãóÌúáöÓğÇ áóãú íóĞúßõÑõæÇ Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì İöíåö ÅöáøóÇ ÑóÃóæúåõ ÍóÓúÑóÉğ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (No people sit together without mentioning Allah, but they will see that as regret on the Day of Resurrection.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇĞúßõÑõæÇú Çááøóåó ĞößúÑÇğ ßóËöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (Remember Allah with much remembrance. ) "Allah did not enjoin any duty upon His servants without setting known limits and accepting the excuses of those who have a valid excuse -- apart from Dhikr, for Allah has not set any limits for it, and no one has any excuse for not remembering Allah unless he is oppressed and forced to neglect it. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú Çááøóåó ŞöíóÜãÇğ æóŞõÚõæÏÇğ æóÚóáóì ÌõäõæÈößõãú</div><br>  (Remember Allah standing, sitting down, and (lying down) on your sides) (4:103). By night and by day, on land and on sea, when traveling and when staying home, in richness and in poverty, in sickness and in health, in secret and openly, in all situations and circumstances. And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÈøöÍõæåõ ÈõßúÑóÉğ æóÃóÕöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And glorify His praises morning and Asila.) If you do this, He and His angels will send blessings upon you.'' There are very many Ayat, Hadiths and reports which encourage the remembrance of Allah, and this Ayah urges us to remember Him much. People such as An-Nasa'i and Al-Ma`mari and others have written books about the Adhkar to be recited at different times of the night and day.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÈøöÍõæåõ ÈõßúÑóÉğ æóÃóÕöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And glorify His praises morning and Asila) in the morning and in the evening. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓõÈúÍóÇäó Çááøóåö Íöíäó ÊõãúÓõæäó æóÍöíäó ÊõÕúÈöÍõæäó - æóáóåõ ÇáúÍóãúÏõ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÚóÔöíøÇğ æóÍöíäó ÊõÙúåöÑõæäó </div><br>  (So glorify Allah, when you come up to the evening, and when you enter the morning. And His are all the praises and thanks in the heavens and the earth; and in the afternoon and when you come up to the time, when the day begins to decline.) (30:17-18).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöì íõÕóáøöì Úóáóíúßõãú æóãóáóÜÆößóÊõåõ</div><br>  (He it is Who sends Salah on you, and His angels too,) This is encouragement to remember Allah, i.e., He will remember you, so remember Him. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ İöíßõãú ÑóÓõæáÇğ ãøöäúßõãú íóÊúáõæÇú Úóáóíúßõãú ÂíóÜÊöäóÇ æóíõÒóßøöíßõãú æóíõÚóáøöãõßõãõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó æóÇáúÍößúãóÉó æóíõÚóáøöãõßõã ãøóÇ áóãú ÊóßõæäõæÇú ÊóÚúáóãõæäó - İóÇĞúßõÑõæäöì ÃóĞúßõÑúßõãú æóÇÔúßõÑõæÇú áöí æóáÇó ÊóßúİõÑõæäö </div><br>  (Similarly, We have sent among you a Messenger of your own, reciting to you Our Ayat and purifying you, and teaching you the Book and the Hikmah, and teaching you that which you used not to know. Therefore remember Me. I will remember you, and be grateful to Me and never be ungrateful to Me) (2:151-152) The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì: ãóäú ĞóßóÑóäöí İöí äóİúÓöåö ĞóßóÑúÊõåõ İöííóäİúÓöí¡ æóãóäú ĞóßóÑóäöí İöí ãóáóÅò ĞóßóÑúÊõåõ İöí ãóáóÅò ÎóíúÑò ãöäúå»</div><br>  (Allah says: "Whoever remembers Me to himself, I will remember him to Myself, and whoever remembers Me in a gathering, I will remember him in a better gathering.'') <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of Salah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's Salah means that He praises His servant before the angels, as Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Al-`Aliyah. This was recorded by Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi from Ar-Rabi` bin Anas from Anas. Others said: "Allah's Salah means mercy.'' It may be said that there is no contradiction between these two views. And Allah knows best. Salah from the angels means their supplication and seeking forgiveness for people, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÍúãöáõæäó ÇáúÚóÑúÔó æóãóäú Íóæúáóåõ íõÓóÈøöÍõæäó ÈöÍóãúÏö ÑóÈøöåöãú æóíõÄúãöäõæäó Èöåö æóíóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõæäó áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÓöÚúÊó ßõÜáøó ÔóìúÁò ÑøóÍúãóÉğ æóÚöáúãÇğ İóÇÛúİöÑú áöáøóĞöíäó ÊóÇÈõæÇú æóÇÊøóÈóÚõæÇú ÓóÈöíáóßó æóŞöåöãú ÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáúÌóÍöíãö - ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÃóÏúÎöáúåõãú ÌóäøóÜÊö ÚóÏúäò ÇáøóÊöì æóÚóÏúÊøóåõãú æóãóä ÕóÜáóÍó ãöäú ÁóÇÈóÂÆöåöãú æóÃóÒúæóÌöåöãú æóĞõÑøöíøóÜÊöåöãú Åöäøóßó ÃóäÊó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÍóßöíãõ </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞöåöãõ ÇáÓøóíøÆóÜÊö</div><br>  (Those who bear the Throne and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (saying): "Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire! Our Lord! And make them enter the `Adn Garden which you have promised them -- and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring! Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. And save them from the sins.'') (40:7-9) t   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíõÎúÑöÌóßõãú ãøöäó ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö Åöáóì ÇáäøõæÑö</div><br>  (that He may bring you out from darkness into light. ) means, by means of His mercy towards you, His praise of you and the supplication of His angels for you, He brings you forth from the darkness of ignorance and misguidance into the light of guidance and certain faith.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÈöÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÑóÍöíãÇğ</div><br>  (And He is Ever Most Merciful to the believers.) means, in this world and in the Hereafter: in this world He guides them to the truth of which others are ignorant, and He shows them the path from which others have gone astray, those who call for disbelief and innovation, and their followers among the wrongdoers. His mercy towards them in the Hereafter means that He will save them from the greater terror (of the Day of Resurrection) and will command His angels to greet them with the glad tidings of Paradise and salvation from the Fire, which will only be because of His love for them and His kindness towards them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "The Messenger of Allah and a group of his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, passed by a young child in the road. When his mother saw the people, she feared that her child may be crushed by the crowd, so she rushed forward, crying, `My son, my son!' She ran and picked him up, and the people said, `O Messenger of Allah, she would never throw her child in the Fire.' The Messenger of Allah convincingly said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ¡ æóÇááåö áóÇíõáúŞöí ÍóÈöíÈóåõ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (No, and Allah will not throw His beloved in the Fire.) Its chain of narrators meets the conditions of the Two Sahihs, although none of the authors of the Six Books recorded it. But in Sahih Al-Bukhari it is recorded from the Commander of the faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah saw a woman among the prisoners of war picking up her child, clasping the child to her breast and nursing him. The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊõÑóæúäó åóĞöåö ÊõáúŞöí æóáóÏóåóÇ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑö æóåöíó ÊóŞúÏöÑõ Úóáóì Ğóáößó¿»</div><br>  (Do you think that this woman would throw her child into the Fire even though she is (physically) able to do so) They said, "No.'' The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóæóÇááåö ááåõ ÃóÑúÍóãõ ÈöÚöÈóÇÏöåö ãöäú åóĞöåö ÈöæóáóÏöåóÇ»</div><br>  (By Allah, Allah is more merciful towards His servants than this woman is to her child.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÍöíøóÊõåõãú íóæúãó íóáúŞóæúäóåõ ÓóáóÜãñ</div><br>  (Their greeting on the Day they shall meet Him will be "Salam!'') The apparent meaning -- and Allah knows best -- is that their greeting, from Allah on the Day that they meet Him, will be Salam, i.e., He will greet them with Salam, as He says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóáÇóãñ ŞóæúáÇğ ãøöä ÑøóÈøò ÑøóÍöíãò </div><br>  ((It will be said to them): Salam -- a Word from the Lord, Most Merciful.) (36:58) Qatadah claimed that the meaning was that they would greet one another with Salam on the Day when they meet Allah in the Hereafter. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏóÚúæóåõãú İöíåóÇ ÓõÈúÍóÜäóßó Çááøóåõãøó æóÊóÍöíøóÊõåõãú İöíåóÇ ÓóáÇóãñ æóÁóÇÎöÑõ ÏóÚúæóÇåõãú Ãóäö ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (Their way of request therein will be `Glory to You, O Allah,' and `Salam' will be their greetings therein! and the close of their request will be `All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all that exits.') (10:10)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÚóÏøó áóåõãú ÃóÌúÑÇğ ßóÑöíãÇğ</div><br>  (And He has prepared for them a generous reward.) means Paradise and everything in it of food, drink, clothing, dwellings, physical pleasure, luxuries and delightful scenes, such as no eye has seen, no ear has heard and has never entered the mind of man.  </div></body></html>
