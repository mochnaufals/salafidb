Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÂÁó æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó æóãóÇ ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ ÈóÜØöáÇğ Ğóáößó Ùóäøõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve!) meaning, those who do not think that the resurrection and the place of return will occur, but they think that there is nothing after this world.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóæóíúáñ áøöáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö</div><br>  (Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) means, woe to them on the Day when they will be resurrected, from the Fire that is prepared for them. Then Allah explains that because of His justice and wisdom, He does not treat the believers and the disbelievers equally. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú äóÌúÚóáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö ßóÇáúãõİúÓöÏöíäó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö Ãóãú äóÌúÚóáõ ÇáúãõÊøóŞöíäó ßóÇáúİõÌøóÇÑö </div><br>  (Shall We treat those who believe and do righteous good deeds as those who do mischief on the earth Or shall We treat Those who have Taqwa as the evildoers) meaning, `We shall not do that.' They are not equal before Allah, and since this is the case, there must inevitably be another realm in which those who obey Allah will be rewarded and the wicked will be punished. This teaching indicates to those of a sound mind and upright nature that there must inevitably be a resurrection and recompense. We see evildoers and criminals are prospering and increasing in wealth, children and luxury, until they die in that state. We see oppressed believers dying of grief and distress, so by the wisdom of the All-Wise, All-Knowing, All-Just who does not do even a speck of dust's weight of injustice, there should be a time when the rights of the oppressed are restored with due justice. If this does not happen in this world, there must be another realm where recompense may be made and consolation may be found. The Qur'an teaches sound aims based on a rational way of thinking, so Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßöÊóÜÈñ ÃóäÒóáúäóÜåõ Åöáóíúßó ãõÈóÜÑóßñ áøöíóÏøóÈøóÑõæÇú ÁóÇíóÜÊöåö æóáöíóÊóĞóßøóÑó Ãõæúáõæ ÇáÇøñáúÈóÜÈö </div><br>  ((This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Ayat, and that men of understanding may remember.) meaning, those who are possessed of wisdom and reason.  </div></body></html>
