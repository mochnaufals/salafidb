According to the Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãõãøóßó æóÃóÈóÇßó¡ Ëõãøó ÃóÏúäóÇßó ÃóÏúäóÇß»</div><br>  æİí ÑæÇíÉ   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ëõãøó ÇáúÃóŞúÑóÈó İóÇáúÃóŞúÑóÈ»</div><br>  (Your mother and your father, then your closest relatives and the next closest.)  According to another Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóÍóÈøó Ãóäú íõÈúÓóØó áóåõ İöí ÑöÒúŞöåö æóíõäúÓóÃó áóåõ İöí ÃóÌóáöåö¡ İóáúíóÕöáú ÑóÍöãóå»</div><br>  (Whoever would like to see his provision expanded and his life extended, let him maintain his ties of kinship.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊõÈóĞøöÑú ÊóÈúĞöíÑğÇ</div><br>  (But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.) When Allah commands spending, He forbids extravagance. Spending should be moderate, as stated in another Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÂ ÃóäİóŞõæÇú áóãú íõÓúÑöİõæÇú æóáóãú íóŞúÊõÑõæÇú</div><br>  (And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy). 25:67  Then He says, to discourage extravagance:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõÈóĞÑöíäó ßóÇäõæÇú ÅöÎúæóäó ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäö</div><br>  (Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayatin,) They have this trait in common. Ibn Mas`ud said: "This refers spending extravagantly when it is not appropriate.'' Ibn `Abbas said likewise. Mujahid said: "If a man spends all his wealth on appropriate things, then he is not a spendthrift, but if he spends a little inappropriately, then he is a spendthrift.'' Qatadah said: "Extravagance means spending money on sin in disobeying Allah, and on wrongful and corrupt things.'' Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said: "A man came from Banu Tamim to the Messenger of Allah and said: `O Messenger of Allah, I have a lot of wealth, I have a family, children, and the refinements of city life, so tell me how I should spend and what I should do.' The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊõÎúÑöÌõ ÇáÒøóßóÇÉó ãöäú ãóÇáößó Åöäú ßóÇäó¡ İóÅöäøóåóÇ ØõåúÑóÉñ ÊõØóåøöÑõßó¡ æóÊóÕöáõ ÃóŞúÑöÈóÇÁóßó¡ æóÊóÚúÑöİõ ÍóŞøó ÇáÓøóÇÆöáö æóÇáúÌóÇÑö æóÇáúãöÓúßöíä»</div><br>  (Pay the Zakah on your wealth if any is due, for it is purification that will make you pure, maintain your ties of kinship, pay attention to the rights of beggars, neighbors and the poor.) He said: `O Messenger of Allah, make it less for me.' He recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊö ĞóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÈóì ÍóŞøóåõ æóÇáúãöÓúßöíäó æóÇÈúäó ÇáÓøóÈöíáö æóáÇó ÊõÈóĞøöÑú ÊóÈúĞöíÑğÇ </div><br>  (And give to the kinsman his due, and to the Miskin (poor) and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully in the manner of a spendthrift.) The man said, `That is enough for me, O Messenger of Allah. If I pay Zakah to your messenger, will I be absolved of that duty before Allah and His Messenger' The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú¡ ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÏøóíúÊóåóÇ Åöáóì ÑóÓõæáöí İóŞóÏú ÈóÑöÆúÊó ãöäúåóÇ æóáóßó ÃóÌúÑõåóÇ¡ æóÅöËúãõåóÇ Úóáóì ãóäú ÈóÏøóáóåóÇ»</div><br>  (Yes, if you give it to my messenger, you will have fulfilled it, and you will have the reward for it, and the sin is on the one who changes it.)''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõÈóĞÑöíäó ßóÇäõæÇú ÅöÎúæóäó ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäö</div><br>  (Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayatin,) meaning, they are their brothers in extravagance, foolishness, failing to obey Allah and committing sin. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ áöÑóÈøöåö ßóİõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (and the Shaytan is ever ungrateful to his Lord.) meaning, he is an ingrate, because he denied the blessings of Allah and did not obey Him, turning instead to disobedience and rebellion.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöãøóÇ ÊõÚúÑöÖóäøó Úóäúåõãõ ÇÈúÊöÛóÂÁó ÑóÍúãóÉò ãøöä ÑøóÈøößó</div><br>  (And if you turn away from them and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord) `If your relatives and those to whom We have commanded you to give, ask you for something, and you do not have anything, and you turn away from them because you have nothing to give,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞõá áøóåõãú ŞóæúáÇğ ãøóíúÓõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (then, speak unto them a soft, kind word.) meaning, with a promise. This was the opinion of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others.  </div></body></html>
