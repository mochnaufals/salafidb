It is also called, Umm Al-Kitab (the Mother of the Book), according to  the majority of the scholars. In an authentic Hadith recorded by At-Tirmidhi,  who graded it Sahih, Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah  said,   <br><div id="arabic" dir=rtl>«ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááåö ÑóÈó ÇáúÚóÇáóãöíäó Ãõãøõ ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö æóÃõãøõ ÇáúßöÊóÇÈö æóÇáÓøóÈúÚõ  ÇáúãóËóÇäöí æóÇáúŞõÑúÂäõ ÇáúÚóÙöíãõ»</div><br>  (Al-Hamdu lillahi Rabbil-`Alamin is the Mother of the Qur'an,  the Mother of the Book, and the seven repeated Ayat of the Glorious Qur'an.)  It is also called Al-Hamd and As-Salah, because the Prophet said that his  Lord said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÓóãúÊõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó Èóíúäöí æóÈóíúäó ÚóÈúÏöí äöÕúİóíúäö¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ŞóÇáó ÇáúÚóÈúÏõ:ÇáúÍóãúÏõÏöááå  ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÇáóãöíäó¡ ŞóÇáó Çááåõ: ÍóãöÏóäöí ÚóÈúÏöí»</div><br>  (`The prayer (i.e., Al-Fatihah) is divided into two halves between Me and  My servants.' When the servant says, `All praise is due to Allah, the Lord  of existence,' Allah says, 'My servant has praised Me.')  Al-Fatihah was called the Salah, because reciting it is a condition  for the correctness of Salah - the prayer. Al-Fatihah was also called  Ash-Shifa' (the Cure).  It is also called Ar-Ruqyah (remedy), since in the Sahih, there is the  narration of Abu Sa`id telling the the story of the Companion who used  Al-Fatihah as a remedy for the tribal chief who was poisoned. Later, the  Messenger of Allah said to a Companion,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóãóÇ íõÏúÑöíßó ÃóäøóåóÇ ÑõŞúíóÉñ»</div><br>  (How did you know that it is a Ruqyah)  Al-Fatihah was revealed in Makkah as Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and  Abu Al-`Aliyah stated.

Allah knows  best. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>How many Ayat does Al-Fatihah contain</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  There is no disagreement over the view that Al-Fatihah contains seven Ayat. According to the majority of the reciters of Al-Kufah, a group of the Companions, the Tabi`in, and a number of scholars from the successive generations, the Bismillah is a separate Ayah in its beginning. We will mention this subject again soon, if Allah wills, and in Him we trust. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Number of Words and Letters in Al-Fatihah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The scholars say that Al-Fatihah consists of twenty-five words, and that it contains one hundred and thirteen letters. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reason it is called Umm Al-Kitab</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  In the beginning of the Book of Tafsir, in his Sahih, Al-Bukhari said; "It is called Umm Al-Kitab, because the Qur'an starts with it and because the prayer is started by reciting it.'' It was also said that it is called Umm Al-Kitab, because it contains the meanings of the entire Qur'an. Ibn Jarir said, "The Arabs call every comprehensive matter that contains several specific areas an Umm. For instance, they call the skin that surrounds the brain, Umm Ar-Ra's. They also call the flag that gathers the ranks of the army an Umm.'' He also said, "Makkah was called Umm Al-Qura, (the Mother of the Villages) because it is the grandest and the leader of all villages. It was also said that the earth was made starting from Makkah.''  Further, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah narrated about Umm Al-Qur'an that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åöíó Ãõãøõ ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö æóåöíó ÇáÓøóÈúÚõ ÇáúãóËóÇäöí æóåöíó ÇáúŞõÑúÂäõ ÇáúÚóÙöíãõ»</div><br>  (It is Umm Al-Qur'an, the seven repeated (verses) and the Glorious Qur'an.)  Also, Abu Ja`far, Muhammad bin Jarir At-Tabari recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Messenger of Allah said about Al-Fatihah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åöíó Ãõãøõ ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö æóåöíó İóÇÊöÍóÉõ ÇáúßöÊóÇÈö æóåöíó ÇáÓøóÈúÚõ ÇáúãóËóÇäöí»</div><br>  (It is Umm Al-Qur'an, Al-Fatihah of the Book (the Opener of the Qur'an) and the seven repeated (verses).) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Virtues of Al-Fatihah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded in the Musnad that Abu Sa`id bin Al-Mu`alla said, "I was praying when the Prophet called me, so I did not answer him until I finished the prayer.

Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also recorded this Hadith.  Also, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, "The Messenger of Allah went out while Ubayy bin Ka`b was praying and said, (O Ubayy!) Ubayy did not answer him. The Prophet said, (O Ubayy!) Ubayy prayed faster then went to the Messenger of Allah saying, `Peace be unto you, O Messenger of Allah!' He said, (Peace be unto you. O Ubayy, what prevented you from answering me when I called you) He said, `O Messenger of Allah! I was praying.'

The Messenger of Allah said, (I hope that I will not leave through this door until you have learned it.) He (Ka`b) said, `The Messenger of Allah held my hand while speaking to me. Meanwhile I was slowing down fearing that he might reach the door before he finished his conversation. When we came close to the door, I said: O Messenger of Allah ! What is the Surah that you have promised to teach me' He said, (What do you read in the prayer.) Ubayy said, `So I recited Umm Al-Qur'an to him.' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö ãóÇ ÃóäúÒóáó Çááåõ İöí ÇáÊøóæÑóÇÉö æóáóÇ İöí ÇáúÅöäúÌöíáö æóáóÇ İöí ÇáÒøóÈõæÑö æóáóÇ İöí ÇáúİõÑúŞóÇäö ãöËúáóåóÇ ÅöäøóåóÇ ÇáÓøóÈúÚõ ÇáúãóËóÇäöí»</div><br>  (By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! Allah has never revealed in the Tawrah, the Injil, the Zabur or the Furqan a Surah like it. It is the seven repeated verses that I was given.)''  Also, At-Tirmidhi recorded this Hadith and in his narration, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöäøóåóÇ ãöäó ÇáÓøóÈúÚö ÇáúãóËóÇäöí æóÇáúŞõÑúÂäö ÇáúÚóÙöíãö ÇáøóĞöí ÃõÚúØöíÊõåõ»</div><br>  (It is the seven repeated verses and the Glorious Qur'an that I was given.) At-Tirmidhi then commented that this Hadith is Hasan Sahih.  There is a similar Hadith on this subject narrated from Anas bin Malik Further, `Abdullah, the son of Imam Ahmad, recorded this Hadith from Abu Hurayrah from Ubayy bin Ka`b, and he mentioned a longer but similar wording for the above Hadith. In addition, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith from Abu Hurayrah from Ubayy bin Ka`b who said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÃóäúÒóá Çááåõ İöí ÇáÊøóæÑóÇÉö æóáóÇ İöí ÇáúÅöäúÌöíáö ãöËúáó Ãõãøö ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö æóåöíó ÇáÓøóÈúÚõ ÇáúãóËóÇäöí æóåöíó ãóŞúÓõæãóÉñ Èóíúäöí æóÈóíúäó ÚóÈúÏöí äöÕúİóíúäö»</div><br>  (Allah has never revealed in the Tawrah or the Injil anything similar to Umm Al-Qur'an.  It is the seven repeated verses and it is divided into two halves between Allah and His servant.)  This is the wording reported by An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib.  Also, Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn Jabir said, "I went to the Messenger of Allah after he had poured water (for purification) and said, `Peace be unto you, O Messenger of Allah!' He did not answer me. So I said again, `Peace be unto you, O Messenger of Allah!' Again, he did not answer me, so I said again, `Peace be unto you, O Messenger of Allah!' Still he did not answer me. The Messenger of Allah went while I was following him, until he arrived at his residence. I went to the Masjid and sat there sad and depressed. The Messenger of Allah came out after he performed his purification and said, (Peace and Allah's mercy be unto you, peace and Allah's mercy be unto you, peace and Allah's mercy be unto you.) He then said, (O `Abdullah bin Jabir! Should I inform you of the best Surah in the Qur'an) I said, `Yes, O Messenger of Allah!' He said, (Read, `All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the existence,' until you finish it.)'' This Hadith has a good chain of narrators.  Some scholars relied on this Hadith as evidence that some Ayat and Surahs have more virtues than others.  Furthermore, in the chapter about the virtues of the Qur'an, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, "Once, we were on a journey when a female servant came and said, `The leader of this area has been poisoned and our people are away. Is there a healer among you' Then a man whose healing expertise did not interest us stood for her, he read a Ruqyah for him, and he was healed. The chief gave him thirty sheep as a gift and some milk. When he came back to us we said to him, `You know of a (new) Ruqyah, or did you do this before' He said, `I only used Umm Al-Kitab as Ruqyah.' We said, `Do not do anything further until we ask the Messenger of Allah.' When we went back to Al-Madinah we mentioned what had happened to the Prophet . The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóãóÇ ßóÇäó íõÏúÑöíåö ÃóäøóåóÇ ÑõŞúíóÉñ ÇŞúÓöãõæÇ æóÇÖúÑöÈõæÇ áöí ÈöÓóåúãò»</div><br>  (Who told him that it is a Ruqyah Divide (the sheep) and reserve a share for me.)''  Also, Muslim recorded in his Sahih, and An-Nasa'i in his Sunan that Ibn `Abbas said, "While Jibril (Gabriel) was with the Messenger of Allah , he heard a noise from above. Jibril lifted his sight to the sky and said, `This is a door in heaven being open, and it has never been opened before now.' An angel descended from that door and came to the Prophet and said, `Receive the glad tidings of two lights that you have been given, which no other Prophet before you was given: the Opening of the Book and the last (three) Ayat of Surat Al-Baqarah. You will not read a letter of them, but will gain its benefit.''' This is the wording collected by An-Nasa'i (Al-Kubra 5:12) and Muslim recorded similar wording (1:554). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Al-Fatihah and the Prayer</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Õóáóì ÕóáóÇÉğ áóãú íóŞúÑóÃú İöíåóÇ Ãõãøó ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö İóåöíó ÎöÏóÇÌñ ËóáóÇËğÇ  ÛóíúÑõ ÊóãóÇãò»</div><br>  (Whoever performs any prayer in which he did not read Umm Al-Qur'an, then  his prayer is incomplete.)

Also, in the last Hadith, Allah said,  "I have divided the prayer between Myself and My servant into two halves, a  half for Me and a half for My servant. My servant shall have what he asked for.''  Allah next explained the division that involves reciting Al-Fatihah,  demonstrating the importance of reciting the Qur'an during the prayer,  which is one of the prayer's greatest pillars. Hence, the word `prayer' was  used here although only a part of it was actually being referred to, that is,  reciting the Qur'an. Similarly, the word `recite' was used where prayer  is meant, as demonstrated by Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõÑúÁóÇäó ÇáúİóÌúÑö Åöäøó ŞõÑúÁóÇäó ÇáúİóÌúÑö ßóÇäó ãóÔúåõæÏğÇ</div><br>  (And recite the Qur'an in the early dawn.Verily, the recitation of the  Qur'an in the early dawn is ever witnessed.) in reference to the Fajr prayer.

The Hadith that we mentioned also testifies to this fact, for the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Õóáøóì ÕóáóÇÉğ áóãú íóŞúÑóÃú İöíåóÇ ÈöÃõãøö ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö İóåöíó ÎöÏóÇÌñ»</div><br>  (Whoever performs any prayer in which he did not recite Umm Al-Qur'an, his prayer is incomplete.)

Also, Ibn Majah recorded that `Ali bin Al-Mundhir said that Ibn Fudayl narrated that `Ata' bin As-Sa'ib said that Abu `Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami said that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó Åöäøöí ÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ãöäó ÇáÔøóíØóÇäö ÇáÑóÌöíãö æóåóãúÒöåö æóäóİúÎöåö æóäóİúËöåö»</div><br>  (O Allah!

An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith in his book, Al-Yawm wal-Laylah.  Al-Bukhari recorded that Sulayman bin Surad said, "Two men disputed in the presence of the Prophet while we were sitting with him. One of them was cursing the other fellow and his face turned red due to anger. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí áóÃóÚúáóãõ ßóáöãóÉğ áóæú ŞóÇáóåóÇ áóĞóåóÈó Úóäúåõ ãóÇ íóÌöÏõ¡ áóæú ŞóÇáó: ÃóÚõæĞõ ÈöÇááåö ãöäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäö ÇáÑøóÌöíãö»</div><br>  (I know of a statement which if he said it, will make what he feels disappear, `I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.') They said to the man, `Do you not hear what the Messenger of Allah is saying' He said, `I am not insane.''' Also, Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith.  There are many other Hadiths about seeking refuge with Allah. One can find this subject in the books on supplication and the virtues of righteous, good deeds. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Is the Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge) required</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The majority of the scholars state that reciting the Isti`adhah (in the prayer and when reciting the Qur'an) is recommended and not required, and therefore, not reciting it does not constitute a sin. However, Ar-Razi recorded that `Ata' bin Abi Rabah said that the Isti`adhah is required in the prayer and when one reads the Qur'an. In support of `Ata's statement, Ar-Razi relied upon the apparent meaning of the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÓúÊóÚöĞú</div><br>  (Then seek refuge.) He said that the Ayah contains a command that requires implementation. Also, the Prophet always said the Isti`adhah. In addition, the Isti`adhah wards off the evil of Satan, which is neccessary, the rule is that the means needed to implement a requirement of the religion is itself also required. And when one says, "I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed devil.'' Then this will suffice. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Virtues of the Isti`adhah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The Isti`adhah cleanses the mouth from the foul speech that it has indulged in. It also purifies the mouth and prepares it to recite the speech of Allah. Further, the Isti`adhah entails seeking Allah's help and acknowledging His ability to do everything. The Isti`adhah also affirms the servant's meekness, weakness and inability to face the enemy of his inner evil, whom Allah alone, Who created this enemy, is able to repel and defeat. This enemy does not accept kindness, unlike the human enemy. There are three Ayat in the Qur'an that affirm this fact. Also, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÚöÈóÇÏöì áóíúÓó áóßó Úóáóíúåöãú ÓõáúØóÜäñ æóßóİóì ÈöÑóÈøößó æóßöíáÇğ </div><br>  (Verily, My servants (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) Ü you have no authority over them. And sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.) (17:65).  We should state here that the believers, whom the human enemies kill, become martyrs, while those who fall victim to the inner enemy - Satan - become bandits. Further, the believers who are defeated by the apparent enemy - disbelievers - gain a reward, while those defeated by the inner enemy earn a sin and become misguided. Since Satan sees man where man cannot see him, it is befitting that the believers seek refuge from Satan with Whom Satan cannot see. The Isti`adhah is a form of drawing closer to Allah and seeking refuge with Him from the evil of every evil creature. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>What does Isti`adhah mean</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Isti`adhah means, "I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs, or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from.'' Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus, only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil. This meaning is reiterated in only three Ayat in the Qur'an. Allah said in Surat Al-A`raf,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎõĞö ÇáúÚóİúæó æóÃúãõÑú ÈöÇáúÚõÑúİö æóÃóÚúÑöÖ Úóäö ÇáúÌóÜåöáöíäó </div><br>  (Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e. don't punish them).) (7:199)  This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöãøóÇ íóäóÒóÛóäøóßó ãöäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö äóÒúÛñ İóÇÓúÊóÚöĞú ÈöÇááøóåö Åöäøóåõ ÓóãöíÚñ Úóáöíãñ </div><br>  (And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing (7: 200).)  Allah also said in Surat Al-Mu'minun,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúİóÚú ÈöÇáøóÊöì åöìó ÃóÍúÓóäõ ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÉó äóÍúäõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöãóÇ íóÕöİõæäó - æóŞõáú ÑøóÈøö ÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ãöäú åóãóÒóÇÊö ÇáÔøóíÜØöíäö - æóÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ÑóÈøö Ãóä íóÍúÖõÑõæäö </div><br>  (Repel evil with that which is better.

And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing) (41:34-36). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Why the Devil is called Shaytan</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  In the Arabic language, Shaytan is derived from Shatana, which means the far thing. Hence, the Shaytan has a different nature than mankind, and his sinful ways are far away from every type of righteousness. It was also said that Shaytan is derived from Shata, (literally `burned'), because it was created from fire. Some scholars said that both meanings are correct, although they state that the first meaning is more plausible. Further, Siybawayh (the renowned Arab linguistic) said, "The Arabs say, `So-and-so has Tashaytan,' when he commits the act of the devils. If Shaytan was derived from Shata, they would have said, Tashayyata (rather than Tashaytan).'' Hence, Shaytan is derived from the word that means, far away. This is why they call those who are rebellious (or mischievous) from among the Jinns and mankind a `Shaytan'. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞóáößó ÌóÚóáúäóÇ áößõáøö äöÈöìøò ÚóÏõæøÇğ ÔóíóÜØöíäó ÇáÅöäúÓö æóÇáúÌöäøö íõæÍöì ÈóÚúÖõåõãú Åöáóì ÈóÚúÖò ÒõÎúÑõİó ÇáúŞóæúáö ÛõÑõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies Ü Shayatin (devils) among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception)) (6:112).

Seek refuge with Allah from the devils of mankind and the Jinns.) Abu Dharr said, "I asked him , `Are there human devils' He said, (Yes.)'' Furthermore, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞúØóÚõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó ÇáúãóÑúÃóÉõ æóÇáúÍöãóÇÑõ æóÇáúßóáúÈõ ÇáúÃóÓúæóÏõ»</div><br>  (The woman, the donkey and the black dog interrupt the prayer (if they pass in front of those who do not pray behind a Sutrah, i.e. a barrier).)

Also, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once rode a Berthawn (huge camel) which started to proceed arrogantly. `Umar kept striking the animal, but the animal kept walking in an arrogant manner. `Umar dismounted the animal and said, "By Allah! You have carried me on a Shaytan. I did not come down from it until after I had felt something strange in my heart.''
