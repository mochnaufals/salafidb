Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú äóÇÏóì ÑóÈøõßó ãõæÓóì Ãóäö ÇÆúÊó ÇáúŞóæúãó ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó - Şóæúãó İöÑúÚóæúäó ÃóáÇ íóÊøóŞõæäó - ŞóÇáó ÑóÈøö Åöäøöì ÃóÎóÇİõ Ãóä íõßóĞøöÈõæäö - æóíóÖöíŞõ ÕóÏúÑöì æóáÇó íóäØóáöŞõ áöÓóÇäöì İóÃóÑúÓöáú Åöáóì åóÜÑõæäó - æóáóåõãú Úóáóìøó ĞóäÈñ İóÃóÎóÇİõ Ãóä íóŞúÊõáõæäö </div><br>  (And when your Lord called Musa: "Go to the people who are wrongdoers.

And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.'') So, Musa asked Allah to remove these difficulties for him, as he said in Surah Ta Ha:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÑóÈøö ÇÔúÑóÍú áöì ÕóÏúÑöì - æóíóÓøöÑú áöì ÃóãúÑöì </div><br>  (Musa said: "O my Lord!

Allah told him: do not be afraid of anything like that.

Meaning, `let them go, free them from your captivity, subjugation and torture, for they are the believing servants of Allah, devoted to Him, and with you they are in a position of humiliating torture.' When Musa said that to him, Fir`awn turned away and ignored him completely, regarding him with scorn and thinking little of him.

So he said to him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÊó ãöäó ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (While you were one of the ingrates.) meaning, one of those who deny favors. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó İóÚóáúÊõåóÂ ÅöĞÇğ</div><br>  ((Musa) said: "I did it then...'') meaning, at that time,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäóÇú ãöäó ÇáÖøóÂáøöíäó</div><br>  (when I was in error.) meaning, `before revelation was sent to me and before Allah made me a Prophet and sent me with this Message.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóİóÑóÑúÊõ ãöäßõãú áóãøóÇ ÎöİúÊõßõãú İóæóåóÈó áöì ÑóÈøöì ÍõßúãÇğ æóÌóÚóáóäöì ãöäó ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíäó </div><br>  (So, I fled from you when I feared you.

Now Allah has sent me to you, and if you obey Him, you will be safe, but if you oppose Him, you will be destroyed.' Then Musa said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊöáúßó äöÚúãóÉñ ÊóãõäøõåóÇ Úóáóìøó Ãóäú ÚóÈøóÏÊøó Èóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó </div><br>  (And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, -- that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.) meaning, `whatever favors you did in bringing me up are offset by the evil you did by enslaving the Children of Israel and using them to do your hard labor. Is there any comparison between your favors to one man among them and the evil you have done to all of them What you have mentioned about me is nothing compared to what you have done to them.'  </div></body></html>
