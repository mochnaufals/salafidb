The people of Islam gather weekly, on every Friday in the major places of worship. It was during Friday when Allah finished the creation, the sixth day, during which Allah created the heavens and earth. During Friday, Allah created Adam, and he was placed in Paradise, and ironically, it was a Friday when he was taken out of Paradise. It will be on a Friday when the Last Hour will commence. There is an hour during Friday, wherein no faithful servant asks Allah for something good, but Allah will give him what he asked for. All of this is based upon Hadiths in the authenic collections. In the ancient language Friday was called, `Arubah. It is a fact that previous nations were informed about Friday, but they were led astray from it. The Jews chose Saturday for their holy day, but Adam was not created on Saturday. The Christians chose Sunday, which is the day the creation was initiated. Allah chose Friday for this Ummah, because it is the day the creation was finished.Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÍúäõ ÇáúÇÎöÑõæäó ÇáÓøóÇÈöŞõæäó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ ÈóíúÏó Ãóäøóåõãú ÃõæÊõæÇ ÇáúßöÊóÇÈó ãöäú ŞóÈúáöäóÇ¡ Ëõãøó Åöäøó åóĞóÇ íóæúãóåõãõ ÇáøóĞöí İóÑóÖó Çááåõ Úóáóíúåöãú İóÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇ İöíåö İóåóÏóÇäóÇ Çááåõ áóåõ¡ İóÇáäøóÇÓõ áóäóÇ İöíåö ÊóÈóÚñ¡ ÇáúíóåõæÏõ ÛóÏğÇ æóÇáäøóÕóÇÑóì ÈóÚúÏó ÛóÏò»</div><br>  (We are the last (to come) but the first on the Day of Resurrection, though the former nations were given the Scriptures before us. And this was their day (Friday) the celebration of which was made compulsory for them, but they differed about it. So, Allah gave us guidance to it, and all other people are coming after us: the Jews tomorrow and the Christians the day after tomorrow.'' This is the wording of Al-Bukhari in another narration of Muslim;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÖóáøó Çááåõ Úóäö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö ãóäú ßóÇäó ŞóÈúáóäóÇ¡ İóßóÇäó áöáúíóåõæÏö íóæúãõ ÇáÓøóÈúÊö¡ æóßóÇäó áöáäøóÕóÇÑóì íóæúãõ ÇáúÃóÍóÏö¡ İóÌóÇÁó Çááåõ ÈöäóÇ İóåóÏóÇäóÇ Çááåõ áöíóæúãö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö¡ İóÌóÚóáó ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉó æóÇáÓøóÈúÊó æóÇáúÃóÍóÏó¡ æóßóĞóáößó åõãú ÊóÈóÚñ áóäóÇ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö äóÍúäõ ÇáúÇÎöÑõæäó ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ æóÇáúÃóæøóáõæäó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÇáúãóŞúÖöíøõ Èóíúäóåõãú ŞóÈúáó ÇáúÎóáóÇÆöŞö»</div><br>  (Allah diverted those who were before us from Friday. For the Jews there was Saturday, and for the Christians there was Sunday. Allah then brought us and guided us to Friday. He made them; Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and it is in this order they will come after us on the Day of Resurrection. We are the last of among the people of this world and the first among the created to be judged on the Day of Resurrection.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Necessity of the Remembrance of Allah on Friday, by attending the Khutbah and the Prayer</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah commanded the believers to gather to worship Him on Friday,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÅöĞóÇ äõæÏöìó áöáÕøóáóæÉö ãöä íóæúãö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö İóÇÓúÚóæúÇú Åöáóì ĞößúÑö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed for the Salah on Al-Jumu`ah (Friday), then hasten (Fas`aw) to the remembrance of Allah) meaning, go to it and head for it. The meaning of Sa`y (hasten) here does not refer to walking quickly. It only refers to the importance of it. `Umar bin Al-Khattab and Ibn Mas`ud - may Allah be pleased with them - recited it; (İóÇãúÖõæÇ Åöáóì ĞößúÑö Çááåö) ("Then proceed to the remembrance of Allah.'') As for walking in haste to the prayer, that was indeed prohibited, since it was recorded in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÓóãöÚúÊõãõ ÇáúÅöŞóÇãóÉó İóÇãúÔõæÇ Åöáóì ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö æóÚóáóíúßõãõ ÇáÓøóßöíäóÉó æóÇáúæóŞóÇÑó æóáóÇ ÊõÓúÑöÚõæÇ¡ İóãóÇ ÃóÏúÑóßúÊõãú İóÕóáøõæÇ æóãóÇ İóÇÊóßõãú İóÃóÊöãøõæÇ»</div><br>  (When you hear the Iqamah, proceed to offer the prayer with calmness and solemnity and do not rush. And pray whatever you catch, and complete whatever you have missed.) This is the wording with Al-Bukhari. Abu Qatadah said, "While we were praying behind the Messenger of Allah he heard commotion. At the end of the prayer, the Prophet said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÔóÃúäõßõãú»</div><br>  (What is the matter with you) They said, `We hastened to the prayer.' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóáóÇ ÊóİúÚóáõæÇ¡ ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÊóíúÊõãõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó İóÇãúÔõæÇ æóÚóáóíúßõãõ ÇáÓøóßöíäóÉó İóãóÇ ÃóÏúÑóßúÊõãú İóÕóáøõæÇ æóãóÇ İóÇÊóßõãú İóÃóÊöãøõæÇ»</div><br>  (Don't do that. When you come for prayer, there should be tranquility upon you. Pray what remains of the prayer and complete what you have missed.)'' The Two Sahihs collected this Hadith. Al-Hasan commented, "By Allah! Hastening to the prayer is not accomplished by the feet. Indeed they were prohibited from coming to prayer without tranquility and dignity. Rather it is about the hearts, the intention, and the submission.'' Qatadah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÓúÚóæúÇú Åöáóì ĞößúÑö Çááøóåö</div><br>  "(then hasten to the remembrance of Allah) means that you have to hasten to the prayer with your heart and actions, and walk to it.'' It is recommended for those coming to the Friday prayer to perform Ghusl (taking bath) before they come. It is collected in the Two Sahihs that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÇÁó ÃóÍóÏõßõãõ ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉó İóáúíóÛúÊóÓöáú»</div><br>  (When one of you comes to the Friday prayer, then let him perform bath.) The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Sa`id said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÛõÓúáõ íóæúãö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö æóÇÌöÈñ Úóáì ßõáøö ãõÍúÊóáöãò»</div><br>  (Ghusl on the day of Jumu`ah is Wajib (required) from every Muhtalim. ) Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÍóŞøñ ááå Úóáì ßõáøö ãõÓúáöãò Ãóäú íóÛúÊóÓöáó İöí ßõáøö ÓóÈúÚóÉö ÃóíøóÇãò¡ íóÛúÓöáõ ÑóÃúÓóåõ æóÌóÓóÏóåõ»</div><br>  (It is Allah's right on every Muslim to bathe during every seven days, by washing his head and body.) Muslim collected this Hadith. Jabir narrated that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Úóáì ßõáøö ÑóÌõáò ãõÓúáöãò İöí ßõáøö ÓóÈúÚóÉö ÃóíøóÇãò ÛõÓúáõ íóæúãò æóåõæó íóæúãõ ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö»</div><br>  (Within every seven days, every Muslim man has the obligation to perform Ghusl at least one day, the day of Jumu`ah.) Ahmad, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Hibban collected this Hadith. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Virtues of Jumu`ah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded that `Aws bin `Aws Ath-Thaqafi said that he heard Allah's Messenger say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÛóÓøóáó æóÇÛúÊóÓóáó íóæúãó ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö æóÈóßøóÑó æóÇÈúÊóßóÑó æóãóÔóì æóáóãú íóÑúßóÈú¡ æóÏóäóÇ ãöäó ÇáúÅöãóÇãö æóÇÓúÊóãóÚó æóáóãú íóáúÛõ¡ ßóÇäó áóåõ Èößõáøö ÎõØúæóÉò ÃóÌúÑõ ÓóäóÉò ÕöíóÇãõåóÇ æóŞöíóÇãõåóÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever performs Ghusl (well) on the day of Jumu`ah, leaves early, walking not riding, and sits close to the Imam and listens without talking, will earn the reward of fasting and performing standing (in prayer) for an entire year for every step he takes.) This Hadith has various chains of narration, the compilers of the Four Sunan collected it, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Hasan. The Two Sahihs also recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäö ÇÛúÊóÓóáó íóæúãó ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö ÛõÓúáó ÇáúÌóäóÇÈóÉö Ëõãøó ÑóÇÍó İöí ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÇáúÃõæáóì İóßóÃóäøóãóÇ ŞóÑøóÈó ÈóÏóäóÉğ¡ æóãóäú ÑóÇÍó İöí ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÇáËøóÇäöíóÉö İóßóÃóäøóãóÇ ŞóÑøóÈó ÈóŞóÑóÉğ¡ æóãóäú ÑóÇÍó İöí ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÇáËøóÇáöËóÉö İóßóÃóäøóãóÇ ŞóÑøóÈó ßóÈúÔğÇ ÃóŞúÑóäó¡ æóãóäú ÑóÇÍó İöí ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÇáÑøóÇÈöÚóÉö İóßóÃóäøóãóÇ ŞóÑøóÈó ÏóÌóÇÌóÉğ¡ æóãóäú ÑóÇÍó İöí ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÇáúÎóÇãöÓóÉö İóßóÃóäøóãóÇ ŞóÑøóÈó ÈóíúÖóÉğ¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ÎóÑóÌó ÇáúÅöãóÇãõ ÍóÖóÑóÊö ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉõ íóÓúÊóãöÚõæäó ÇáĞøößúÑó»</div><br>  (Any person who takes a bath on Friday like the bath for sexual impurity and then goes for the prayer in the first hour, it is as if he had sacrificed a camel. Whoever goes in the second hour, it is as if he had sacrificed a cow. Whoever goes in the third hour, then it is as if he had sacrificed a horned ram. If one goes in the fourth hour, then it is as if he had sacrificed a hen. Whoever goes in the fifth hour, then it is as if he had offered an egg. When the Imam appears, the angels present themselves to listen to Allah's remembrance.) It is recommended that one cleans his body, performs Ghusl, wears his best clothes, applies perfume and uses Siwak (tooth stick) for Jumu`ah. We mentioned that Abu Sa`id narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÛõÓúáõ íóæúãö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö æóÇÌöÈñ Úóáì ßõáøö ãõÍúÊóáöãò æóÇáÓøöæóÇßõ æóÃóäú íóãóÓøó ãöäú ØöíÈö Ãóåúáöåö»</div><br>  (Ghusl on the day of Jumu`ah is Wajib (required) from every Muhtalim and also using Siwak and applying some of his household's perfume.)

Then all of this will be an expiation for whatever occurs between that Friday and the next Friday.) Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded in their Sunans that `Abdullah bin Salam said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say, while on the Minbar:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ Úóáóì ÃóÍóÏößõãú áóæö ÇÔúÊóÑóì ËóæúÈóíúäö áöíóæúãö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö Óöæóì ËóæúÈóíú ãöåúäóÊöåö»</div><br>  (What harm would it cause if one of you bought two garments for the day of Jumu`ah, other than the garment he wears daily) `A'ishah said that during a speech he gave on a Friday when he saw people wearing Nimar garments, the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ Úóáóì ÃóÍóÏößõãú Åöäú æóÌóÏó ÓóÚóÉğ Ãóäú íóÊøóÎöĞó ËóæúÈóíúäö áöÌõãõÚóÊöåö Óöæóì ËóæúÈóíú ãöåúäóÊöåö»</div><br>  (When one of you has wealth, he should keep two garments for Friday, other than the two garments he has for his daily wear.) Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of the Call in the Ayah is the Adhan that precedes the Khutbah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ äõæÏöìó áöáÕøóáóæÉö ãöä íóæúãö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö</div><br>  (When the call is proclaimed for the Salah on Friday,) referring to the Adhan which was called, during the time of the Prophet , when he came out of his house and sat on the Minbar. The Adhan would be called before the Prophet near the door of the Masjid. As for the earlier Adhan that the Leader of the faithful, `Uthman bin Affan added, it was done because the Muslims increased in number during his time. Al-Bukhari recorded that As-Sa'ib bin Yazid said, "In the lifetime of the Prophet , Abu Bakr and `Umar, the Adhan for the Friday prayer was pronounced while the Imam sat on the pulpit. But during `Uthman's later time when the Muslims increased in number, an additional call was pronouced upon Az-Zawra', meaning the Adhan was called upon the house which was called Az-Zawra''' Az-Zawra' was the tallest house in Al-Madinah near the Masjid. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Prohibiting buying and selling after the Call on Friday, and the Exhortation to seek Provisions after it</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóĞóÑõæÇú ÇáúÈóíúÚó</div><br>  (and leave off business.) means, hastening to the remembrance of Allah and abandoning business, when the call to the Friday prayer is made. Therefore, the scholars of Islam agree, it is prohibited for Muslims to engage in business transactions after the second Adhan. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößõãú ÎóíúÑñ áøóßõãú Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (That is better for you if you did but know!) means, `your abandoning buying and selling, and instead, corcentrating your attention to Allah's remembrance and the prayer are better for you in this life and the Hereafter, if you but knew.'

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that when the Friday prayer finished, `Irak bin Malik would stand by the gate of the Masjid and invoke Allah, saying, "O Allah! I have accepted and complied with Your Call, performed the prayer You ordered and dispersed as You ordered me. Therefore, grant me of Your favor and You are the best of those who grant provisions.''
