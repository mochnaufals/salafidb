There is no blame on those who are weak or ill or who find no resources to spend, if they are sincere and true (in duty) to Allah and His Messenger. No means (of complaint) can there be against the doers of good. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) (92. Nor (is there blame) on those who came to you to be provided with mounts, when you said: "I can find no mounts for you,'' they turned back, with their eyes overflowing with tears of grief that they could not find anything to spend.) (93. The means (of complaint) is only against those who are rich, and yet ask exemption. They are content to be with (the women) who sit behind (at home) and Allah has sealed up their hearts so that they know not (what they are losing).)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Legitimate Excuses for staying away from Jihad</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah mentions here the valid excuses that permit one to stay away from fighting. He first mentions the excuses that remain with a person, the weakness in the body that disallows one from Jihad, such as blindness, limping, and so forth. He then mentions the excuses that are not permanent, such as an illness that would prevent one from fighting in the cause of Allah, or poverty that prevents preparing for Jihad. There is no sin in these cases if they remain behind, providing that when they remain behind, they do not spread malice or try to discourage Muslims from fighting, but all the while observing good behavior in this state, just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ Úóáóì ÇáúãõÍúÓöäöíäó ãöä ÓóÈöíáò æóÇááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (No means (of complaint) can there be against the doers of good. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) Al-Awza`i said, "The people went out for the Istisqa' (rain) prayer. Bilal bin Sa`d stood up, praised Allah and thanked Him then said, `O those who are present! Do you concur that wrong has been done' They said, `Yes, by Allah!' He said, `O Allah! We hear your statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ Úóáóì ÇáúãõÍúÓöäöíäó ãöä ÓóÈöíáò</div><br>  (No means (of complaint) can there be against the doers of good.) O Allah! We admit our errors, so forgive us and give us mercy and rain.' He then raised his hands and the people also raised their hands, and rain was sent down on them.'' Mujahid said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó Úóáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÇ ãóÂ ÃóÊóæúßó áöÊóÍúãöáóåõãú</div><br>  (Nor (is there blame) on those who came to you to be provided with mounts) Mujahid said; "It was revealed about Bani Muqarrin from the tribe of Muzaynah. '' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Al-Hasan said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóŞóÏú ÎóáøóİúÊõãú ÈöÇáúãóÏöíäóÉö ÃóŞúæóÇãğÇ ãóÇ ÃóäúİóŞúÊõãú ãöäú äóİóŞóÉò æóáóÇ ŞóØóÚúÊõãú æóÇÏöíğÇ æóáóÇ äöáúÊõãú ãöäú ÚóÏõæó äóíúáğÇ ÅöáøóÇ æóŞóÏú ÔóÑóßõæßõãú İöí ÇáúÃóÌúÑ»</div><br>  (Some people have remained behind you in Al-Madinah; and you never spent anything, crossed a valley, or afflicted hardship on an enemy, but they were sharing the reward with you.)

This Hadith has a basis in the Two Sahihs from Anas, the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÈöÇáúãóÏöíäóÉö ÃóŞúæóÇãğÇ ãóÇ ŞóØóÚúÊõãú æóÇÏöíğÇ æóáóÇ ÓöÑúÊõãú ÓóíúÑğÇ ÅöáøóÇ æóåõãú ãóÚóßõã»</div><br>  (Some people have remained behind in Al-Madinah and you never crossed a valley or marched forth, but they were with you.)

Then, Allah criticized those who seek permission to remain behind while they are rich, admonishing them for wanting to stay behind with women who remained in their homes,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóØóÈóÚó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú İóåõãú áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (and Allah has sealed up their hearts, so that they know not (what they are losing).)  </div></body></html>
