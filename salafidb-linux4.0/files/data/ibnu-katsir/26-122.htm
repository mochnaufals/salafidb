The more he repeated his call to them, the more determined were they to cling to their extreme disbelief and resist his call. In the end, they said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÆöäú áøóãú ÊóäúÊóåö íäõæÍõ áóÊóßõæäóäøó ãöäó ÇáúãõÑúÌõæãöíäó</div><br>  (If you cease not, O Nuh you will surely be among those stoned.) meaning, `if you do not stop calling us to your religion,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÊóßõæäóäøó ãöäó ÇáúãõÑúÌõæãöíäó</div><br>  (you will surely be among those stoned.) meaning, `we will stone you.' At that point, he prayed against them, and Allah responded to his prayer.
