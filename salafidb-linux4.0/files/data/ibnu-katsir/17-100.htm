Say: "If you possessed the treasure of the mercy of my Lord, then you would surely hold back for fear of spending, and man is ever miserly!'')</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Holding back is Part of Man's Nature</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says to His Messenger : "Tell them, O Muhammad, even if you had authority over the treasures of Allah, you would refrain from spending for fear of exhausting it.'' Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah said, "This means for fear of poverty,'' lest it run out, despite the fact that it can never be exhausted or come to an end. This is because it is part of your nature. So Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÇáÅäúÓóÜäõ ŞóÊõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (and man is ever miserly.) Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah said: "(This means) stingy and holding back.'' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú áóåõãú äóÕöíÈñ ãøöäó Çáúãõáúßö İóÅöĞÇğ áÇøó íõÄúÊõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓó äóŞöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (Or have they a share in the dominion Then in that case they would not give mankind even a Naqira.) (4:53), meaning that even if they had a share in the authority of Allah, they would not have given anything to anyone, not even the amount of a Naqira (speck on the back of a date stone). Allah describes man as he really is, except for those whom Allah helps and guides. Miserliness, discontent and impatience are human characteristics, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ÎõáöŞó åóáõæÚÇğ - ÅöĞóÇ ãóÓøóåõ ÇáÔøóÑøõ ÌóÒõæÚÇğ - æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÓøóåõ ÇáúÎóíúÑõ ãóäõæÚÇğ - ÅöáÇøó ÇáúãõÕóáøöíäó </div><br>  (Verily, man was created very impatient; irritable when evil touches him; and stingy when good touches him. Except those who are devoted to Salah (prayers). ) (70:19-22). And there are many other such references in the Qur'an. This is an indication of the generosity and kindness of Allah. In the Two Sahihs it says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÏõ Çááåö ãóáúÃóì áóÇ íóÛöíÖõåóÇ äóİóŞóÉñ ÓóÍøóÇÁõ Çááøóíúáó æóÇáäøóåóÇÑó¡ ÃóÑóÃóíúÊõãú ãóÇ ÃóäúİóŞó ãõäúĞõ ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãóæóÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖó¡ İóÅöäøóåõ áóãú íóÛöÖú ãóÇ İöí íóãöíäöå»</div><br>  (Allah's Hand is full and never decreases because of His giving night and day. Do you not see how much He has given since He created the heavens and the earth, yet that which is in His right hand never decreases.)  </div></body></html>
