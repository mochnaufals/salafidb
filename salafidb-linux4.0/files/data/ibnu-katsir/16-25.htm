They used to say that he (the Prophet ) was a sorcerer, a poet, a soothsayer, or a madman, then they settled on an idea proposed by their leader, an individual known as Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah Al-Makhzumi, when:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ İóßøóÑó æóŞóÏøóÑó - İóŞõÊöáó ßóíúİó ŞóÏøóÑó - Ëõãøó ŞõÊöáó ßóíúİó ŞóÏøóÑó - Ëõãøó äóÙóÑó - Ëõãøó ÚóÈóÓó æóÈóÓóÑó - Ëõãøó ÃóÏúÈóÑó æóÇÓúÊóßúÈóÑó - İóŞóÇáó Åöäú åóÜĞóÂ ÅöáÇøó ÓöÍúÑñ íõÄúËóÑõ </div><br>  (He thought, and plotted.

So they dispersed having agreed on this opinion, may Allah punish them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíóÍúãöáõæÇú ÃóæúÒóÇÑóåõãú ßóÇãöáóÉğ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö æóãöäú ÃóæúÒóÇÑö ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÖöáøõæäóåõãú ÈöÛóíúÑö Úöáúãò</div><br>  (They will bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection, and also of the burdens of those whom they misled without knowledge.) meaning, `We decreed that they would say that, so they will carry the burden of their own sins and some of the burden of those who followed them and agreed with them,' i.e., they will be held guilty not only for going astray themselves, but also for tempting others and having them follow them. As it says in a Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÏóÚóÇ Åöáóì åõÏğì ßóÇäó áóåõ ãöäó ÇáúÃóÌúÑö ãöËúáõ ÃõÌõæÑö ãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚóåõ¡ áóÇ íóäúŞõÕõ Ğóáößó ãöäú ÃõÌõæÑöåöãú ÔóíúÆğÇ¡ æóãóäú ÏóÚóÇ Åöáóì ÖóáóÇáóÉò ßóÇäó Úóáóíúåö ãöäó ÇáúÅöËúãö ãöËúáõ ÂËóÇãö ãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚóåõ¡ áóÇ íóäúŞõÕõ Ğóáößó ãöäú ÂËóÇãöåöãú ÔóíúÆğÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever invites people to guidance, he will receive a reward like that of those who follow him, without diminishing their reward in the least.

Mujahid said: "They will bear the burden of their own sins, and they will bear the sins of those who obeyed them, but that will not lessen the punishment of those who obeyed them at all.''  </div></body></html>
