(38:1)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ä</div><br>  (Nun. ) (68:1)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çáã </div><br>  (Alif Lam Mim.)

We also discussed this in the beginning of the explanation of Surat Al-Baqarah, and therefore, it is not necessary to repeat it here. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Disbelievers wonder at the Message and Resurrection Allah said,</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäö ÇáúãóÌöíÏö</div><br>  (By the Glorious Qur'an.) means by the Honorable and Great Qur'an, which,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóÃúÊöíåö ÇáúÈóÜØöáõ ãöä Èóíúäö íóÏóíúåö æóáÇó ãöäú Îóáúİöåö ÊóäÒöíáñ ãøöäú Íóßöíãò ÍóãöíÏò </div><br>  (Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it: (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise.)(41:42) The subject of the oath contained in this Ayah is specified afterwards, even though it does not appear by word, emphasizing prophethood, resurrection and affirming that they are true. There are similar kinds of oaths in the Qur'an, whose subject is included in the meaning but not by word, such as,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Õ æóÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäö Ğöì ÇáĞøößúÑö - Èóáö ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú İöì ÚöÒøóÉò æóÔöŞóÇŞò </div><br>  (Sad. By the Qur'an full of reminding. Nay, those who disbelieve are in false pride and opposition.)(38:1-2) Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ş æóÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäö ÇáúãóÌöíÏö - Èóáú ÚóÌöÈõæÇú Ãóä ÌóÂÁóåõãú ãøõäĞöÑñ ãøöäúåõãú İóŞóÇáó ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó åóÜĞóÇ ÔóìúÁñ ÚóÌöíÈñ </div><br>  (Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an. Nay, they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves. So the disbelievers say: "This is a strange thing!'') They wondered at the wisdom behind sending a Messenger who is a human being. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said in another Ayah   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóßóÇäó áöáäøóÇÓö ÚóÌóÈğÇ Ãóäú ÃóæúÍóíúäóÂ Åöáóì ÑóÌõáò ãøöäúåõãú Ãóäú ÃóäĞöÑö ÇáäøóÇÓó</div><br>  (Is it a wonder for mankind that We have sent Our revelation to a man from among themselves (saying): "Warn mankind.'') (10:2), meaning, this is not strange, for Allah chooses Messengers from angels and humans. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored mentioned that the disbelievers also wondered about the Resurrection and discounted its coming,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁöĞóÇ ãöÊúäóÇ æóßõäøóÇ ÊõÑóÇÈÇğ Ğóáößó ÑóÌúÚõ ÈóÚöíÏñ </div><br>  (When we are dead and have become dust. That is a far return.) They said, `after we die, disintegrate, with our organs torn apart and we become dust, how can we be brought back to our original shape and bodies,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÑóÌúÚõ ÈóÚöíÏñ</div><br>  (That is a far return.) `it is not likely that it will ever occur.' They thought that Resurrection was far from happening and will never occur. Allah the Exalted responded to their statement by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÚóáöãúäóÇ ãóÇ ÊóäŞõÕõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ãöäúåõãú</div><br>  (We know that which the earth takes of them.) meaning, `We know what the earth consumes of their dead bodies.' Where and how the bodies disintegrated, what they turned into and how they have become, all of this is never absent from Allah's knowledge.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚöäÏóäóÇ ßöÊóÜÈñ ÍóİöíÙñ</div><br>  (and with Us is a Book preserved,) `that keeps all records. Therefore, Our knowledge is encompassing and the Book of decrees has everything precisely recorded in it. Al-`Awfi narrated that `Abdullah bin `Abbas commented on the statement of Allah the Exalted,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÚóáöãúäóÇ ãóÇ ÊóäŞõÕõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ãöäúåõãú</div><br>  (We know that which the earth takes of them,) "It refers to what the earth consumes of their flesh, skin, bones and hair.'' A similar view was recorded from Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and several others. Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, explained the reason behind their disbelief, rebellion and discounting the possibility of what is truly possible,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ßóĞøóÈõæÇú ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö áóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõãú İóåõãú İöì ÃóãúÑò ãøóÑöíÌò </div><br>  (Nay, but they have denied the truth when it has come to them, so they are in a Marij state.) This is the state of all those who defy the Truth: whatever they say and utter after denying the Truth, is utterly false. Marij means, in disarray, in a confused state and defying the characteristics of the Truth. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßõãú áóİöì Şóæúáò ãøõÎúÊóáöİò - íõÄúİóßõ Úóäúåõ ãóäú Ãõİößó </div><br>  (Certainly, you have different ideas. Turned aside therefrom is he who is turned aside.)(51:8-9)  </div></body></html>
