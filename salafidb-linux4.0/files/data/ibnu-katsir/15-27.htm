The apparent meaning is similar to the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóáóŞó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ãöä ÕóáúÕóÜáò ßóÇáúİóÎøóÇÑö - æóÎóáóŞó ÇáúÌóÂäøó ãöä ãøóÇÑöÌò ãøöä äøóÇÑò </div><br>  (He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the potter's clay, And He created the Jinns from a smokeless flame of fire.) (55:14-15) It was also reported from Mujahid that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÕóáúÕóÜáò</div><br>  (dried (sounding) clay) means "putrid'', but it is more appropriate to interpret an Ayah with another Ayah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöäú ÍóãóÅò ãøóÓúäõæäò</div><br>  (of altered mud) means the dried clay that comes from mud, which is soil. "Altered'' here means smooth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÌóÂäøó ÎóáóŞúäóÜåõ ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (And the Jinn, We created earlier) means before creating humans.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä äøóÇÑö ÇáÓøóãõæãö</div><br>  (from the smokeless flame of fire.) Ibn `Abbas said, "It is the smokeless flame that kills.'' Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi said that Shu`bah narrated to them from Abu Ishaq, who said: "I visited `Umar Al-Asamm when he was sick, and he said: `Shall I not tell you a Hadith that I heard from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud He said: `This smokeless flame is one of the seventy parts of the smokeless fire from which the Jinn where created. Then he recited,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÌóÂäøó ÎóáóŞúäóÜåõ ãöä ŞóÈúáõ ãöä äøóÇÑö ÇáÓøóãõæãö </div><br>  (And the Jinn, We created earlier from the smokeless flame of fire).''' The following is found in the Sahih,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÎõáöŞóÊö ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉõ ãöäú äõæÑò¡ æóÎõáöŞóÊö ÇáúÌóÇäøõ ãöäú ãóÇÑöÌò ãöäú äóÇÑò¡ æóÎõáöŞó ÂÏóãõ ãöãøóÇ æõÕöİó áóßõã»</div><br>  (The angels were created from light, the Jinn were created from a smokeless flame of fire, and Adam was created from that which has been described to you.) The Ayah is intended to point out the noble nature, good essence and pure origin of Adam.  </div></body></html>
