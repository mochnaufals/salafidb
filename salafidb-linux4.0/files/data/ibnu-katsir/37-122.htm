Then Allah revealed to Musa the Clear and Mighty Book, which is the Tawrah, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÁóÇÊóíúäóÇ ãõæÓóì æóåóÜÑõæäó ÇáúİõÑúŞóÇäó æóÖöíóÂÁğ</div><br>  (And indeed We granted to Musa and Harun the criterion (of right and wrong), and a shining light) (21:48).
