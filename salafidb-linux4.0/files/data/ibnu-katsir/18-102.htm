He will show Hell to them, meaning He will bring it forth for them to see its punishment and torment before they enter it. This will intensify their distress and grief. In Sahih Muslim it is recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, "The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÄúÊóì ÈöÌóåóäøóãó ÊõŞóÇÏõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÈöÓóÈúÚöíäó Ãóáúİó ÒöãóÇãò¡ ãóÚó ßõáøö ÒöãóÇãò ÓóÈúÚõæäó Ãóáúİó ãóáóß»</div><br>  (Hell will be brought forth on the Day of Resurrection, pulled by means of seventy thousand reins, each of which will be held by seventy thousand angels.) Then Allah says of them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóÇäóÊú ÃóÚúíõäõåõãú İöì ÛöØóÂÁò Úóä ĞößúÑöì</div><br>  ((To) those whose eyes had been under a covering from My Reminder,) meaning, they neglected it, turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to it, refusing to accept guidance and follow the truth. As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÚúÔõ Úóä ĞößúÑö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö äõŞóíøöÖú áóåõ ÔóíúØóÇäÇğ İóåõæó áóåõ ŞóÑöíäñ </div><br>  (And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious, We appoint for him a Shaytan to be a companion for him.) 43:36 And here Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäõæÇú áÇó íóÓúÊóØöíÚõæäó ÓóãúÚÇğ</div><br>  (and they could not bear to hear (it). ) meaning, they did not understand the commands and prohibitions of Allah. Then He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÍóÓöÈó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú Ãóä íóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÚöÈóÇÏöì ãöä Ïõæäöì ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó</div><br>  (Do then those who disbelieved think that they can take My servants as Awliya' protectors besides Me) meaning, do they think that this is right for them and that it is going to benefit them   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó ÓóíóßúİõÑõæäó ÈöÚöÈóÜÏóÊöåöãú æóíóßõæäõæäó Úóáóíúåöãú ÖöÏøÇğ </div><br>  (Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them) 19:82. Allah says that He has prepared Hell as their abode on the Day of Resurrection.  </div></body></html>
