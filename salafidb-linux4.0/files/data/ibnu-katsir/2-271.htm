And whatever you spend for spendings (e.g., in Sadaqah) or whatever vow you make, be sure Allah knows it all. And for the wrongdoers there are no helpers.) (271. If you disclose your Sadaqat (almsgiving), it is well; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, that is better for you. (Allah) will expiate you some of your sins. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.)</div>  Allah states that He has perfect knowledge of the good deeds performed by all of His creation, such as charity and various vows, and He rewards tremendously for these deeds, provided they are performed seeking His Face and His promise. Allah also warns those who do not work in his obedience, but instead disobey His command, reject His revelation and worship others besides Him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ áöáÙøóÜáöãöíäó ãöäú ÃóäÕóÇÑò</div><br>  (And for the wrongdoers there are no helpers.) meaning, who will save them from Allah's anger and torment on the Day of Resurrection. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Virtue of Disclosing or Concealing Charity</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊõÈúÏõæÇú ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÜÊö İóäöÚöãøóÇ åöìó</div><br>  (If you disclose your Sadaqat, it is well) meaning, "It is well if you make known the charity that you give away.''

However, if there is an apparent wisdom behind disclosing the charity, such as the people imitating this righteous act, then disclosing it becomes better than concealing it. The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÌóÇåöÑõ ÈöÇáúŞõÑúÂäö ßóÇáúÌóÇåöÑö ÈöÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉö¡ æóÇáúãõÓöÑøõ ÈöÇáúŞõÑÂäö ßóÇáúãõÓöÑøö ÈöÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉ»</div><br>  (He who utters aloud Qur'anic recitation is just like he who discloses charity acts. He who conceals Qur'anic recitation is just like he who conceals charity acts.)  The Ayah indicates that it is better that acts of charity be concealed, as reiterated by the Hadith that the Two Sahihs recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóÈúÚóÉñ íõÙöáøõåõãõ Çááåõ İöí Ùöáøöåö íóæúãó áóÇ Ùöáøó ÅáøóÇ Ùöáøõåõ: ÅöãóÇãñ ÚóÇÏöáñ¡ æóÔóÇÈøñ äóÔóÃó İöí ÚöÈóÇÏóÉö Çááåö¡ æóÑóÌõáóÇäö ÊóÍóÇÈøóÇ İöí Çááåö¡ÇÌúÊóãóÚóÇ Úóáóíúåö æóÊóİóÑøóŞóÇ Úóáóíúåö¡ æóÑóÌõáñ ŞóáúÈõåõ ãõÚóáøóŞñ ÈöÇáúãóÓúÌöÏö¡ ÅöĞóÇ ÎóÑóÌó ãöäúåõ ÍóÊøóì íóÑúÌöÚó Åöáóíúåö¡ æóÑóÌõáñ ĞóßóÑó Çááåó ÎóÇáöíğÇ İóİóÇÖóÊú ÚóíúäóÇåõ¡ æóÑóÌõáñ ÏóÚóÊúåõ ÇãúÑóÃóÉñ ĞóÇÊõ ãóäúÕöÈò æóÌóãóÇáò¡ İóŞóÇáó: Åöäøöí ÃóÎóÇİõ Çááåó ÑóÈøó ÇáúÚóÇáóãöíäó¡ æóÑóÌõáñ ÊóÕóÏøóŞó ÈöÕóÏóŞóÉò İóÃóÎúİóÇåóÇ¡ ÍóÊøóì áóÇ ÊóÚúáóãó ÔöãóÇáõåõ ãóÇ ÊõäúİöŞõ íóãöíäõå»</div><br>  (Allah will give shade to seven on the Day when there will be no shade but His.
