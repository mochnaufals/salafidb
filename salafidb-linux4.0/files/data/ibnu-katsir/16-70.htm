He is the One Who created them out of nothing, then He will cause them to die. But there are some of them that He allows to grow old, which is a physical weakness, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞóßõãú ãøöä ÖóÚúİò Ëõãøó ÌóÚóáó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ÖóÚúİò ŞõæøóÉò</div><br>  (Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness) (30:54)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áößóìú áÇó íóÚúáóãó ÈóÚúÏó Úöáúãò ÔóíúÆğÇ</div><br>  (so that they know nothing after having known.) meaning, after he knew things, he will reach a stage where he knows nothing because of weakness of mind due to old age and senility. Thus Al-Bukhari, when commenting on this Ayah, reported a narration from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah used to pray:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ãöäó ÇáúÈõÎúáö æóÇáúßóÓóáö æóÇáúåóÑóãö¡ æóÃóÑúĞóáö ÇáúÚõãõÑö æóÚóĞóÇÈö ÇáúŞóÈúÑö¡ æóİöÊúäóÉö ÇáÏøóÌøóÇáö æóİöÊúäóÉö ÇáúãóÍúíóÇ æóÇáúãóãóÇÊ»</div><br>  (I seek refuge with You from miserliness, laziness, old age, senility, the punishment of the grave, the Fitnah of the Dajjal and the trials of life and death.)  Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma said, in his famous Mu`allaqah: "I became exhausted from the responsibilities of life. Whoever lives for eighty years, no wonder he is tired. I saw death hitting people like a crazed camel, and whoever it hit dies, but whoever is not hit lives until he grows old.''  </div></body></html>
