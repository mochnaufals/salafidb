In the reports that he transmitted from Ibn `Abbas, Ka`b Al-Ahbar and Wahb bin Munabbih - Ibn Ishaq reported that it was the city of Antioch, in which there was a king called Antiochus the son of Antiochus the son of Antiochus, who used to worship idols. Allah sent to him three Messengers, whose names were Sadiq, Saduq and Shalum, and he disbelieved in them. It was also narrated from Buraydah bin Al-Husayb, `Ikrimah, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri that it was Antioch. Some of the Imams were not sure that it was Antioch, as we shall see below after telling the rest of the story, if Allah wills.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÂ Åöáóíúåöãõ ÇËúäóíúäö İóßóĞøóÈõæåõãóÇ</div><br>  (When We sent to them two Messengers, they denied them both;) means, they hastened to disbelieve in them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÚóÒøóÒúäóÇ ÈöËóÇáöËò</div><br>  (so We reinforced them with a third,) means, `We supported and strengthened them with a third Messenger. ' Ibn Jurayj narrated from Wahb bin Sulayman, from Shu`ayb Al-Jaba'i, "The names of the first two Messengers were Sham`un and Yuhanna, and the name of the third was Bulus, and the city was Antioch (Antakiyah).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóÇáõæÇú</div><br>  (and they said) means, to the people of that city,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ Åöáóíúßõãú ãøõÑúÓóáõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, we have been sent to you as Messengers.) meaning, `from your Lord Who created you and Who commands you to worship Him Alone with no partners or associates.' This was the view of Abu Al-`Aliyah. Qatadah bin Di`amah claimed that they were messengers of the Messiah, peace be upon him, sent to the people of Antioch.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú ãóÂ ÃóäÊõãú ÅöáÇøó ÈóÔóÑñ ãøöËúáõäóÇ</div><br>  (They said: "You are only human beings like ourselves...'') means, `so how could you receive revelation when you are human beings and we are human beings, so why do we not receive revelation like you If you are Messengers, you should be angels.' This is like what many of the nations said who disbelieved, as Allah has told us in the Ayah: c   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÈöÃóäøóåõ ßóÇäóÊ ÊøóÃúÊöíåöãú ÑõÓõáõåõã ÈöÇáúÈóíøöäóÜÊö İóŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóÈóÔóÑñ íóåúÏõæäóäóÇ</div><br>  (That was because there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs, but they said: "Shall mere men guide us'') (64: 6) meaning that they were amazed by that and they denied it.

You wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear authority.'') (14:10).

You are only telling lies.'' The Messengers said: "Our Lord knows that we have been sent as Messengers to you.'') This means that the three Messengers answered them saying: "Allah knows that we are His Messengers to you. If we were lying, He would have taken the utmost vengeance against us, but He will cause us to prevail and will make us victorious against you, and you will come to know whose will be the happy end in the Hereafter.'' This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ßóİóì ÈöÇááøóåö Èóíúäöì æóÈóíúäóßõãú ÔóåöíÏÇğ íóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁÇãóäõæÇú ÈöÇáúÈóÜØöáö æóßóİóÑõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÎóÜÓöÑõæäó </div><br>  (Say: "Sufficient is Allah for a witness between me and you.

And Allah knows best.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú ÅöäøóÇ ÊóØóíøóÑúäóÇ Èößõãú áóÆöä áøóãú ÊóäÊóåõæÇú áóäóÑúÌõãóäøóßõãú æóáóíóãóÓøóäøóßõãú ãøöäøóÇ ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ </div><br>  </div></body></html>
