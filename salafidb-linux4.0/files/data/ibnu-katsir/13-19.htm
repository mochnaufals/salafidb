Rather, they believe that all of it is the truth, each part of it testifying to another. They believe that none of its parts contradicts the others, that all its information is true and that all its commandments and prohibitions are just,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóãøóÊú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó ÕöÏúŞÇğ æóÚóÏúáÇğ</div><br>  (And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice.) 6:15 It is accurate in its information and stories and just in what it orders. Therefore, the Ayah says, those who believe in the truth that you brought, O Muhammad, are not at all similar to those who are blind and cannot find guidance to what benefits them, which they cannot even comprehend. And even if they comprehend the guidance, they will not follow it, believe in it or abide by it.' Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÓúÊóæöì ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáäøóÇÑö æóÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö åõãõ ÇáúİóÂÆöÒõæäó </div><br>  (Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.) 59:20 Allah said in this honorable Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóİóãóä íóÚúáóãõ ÃóäøóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúßó ãöä ÑóÈøößó ÇáúÍóŞøõ ßóãóäú åõæó ÃóÚúãóì</div><br>  (Shall he then who knows that what has been revealed unto you from your Lord is the truth, be like him who is blind) They are not equal.

We ask Allah to make us among them.  </div></body></html>
