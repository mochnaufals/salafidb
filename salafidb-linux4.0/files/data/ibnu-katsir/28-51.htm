This was also the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and Abu Razin that the phrase "two kinds of magic'' referred to Musa and Harun. This is a good suggestion.

Waraqah bin Nawfal said, "This is An-Namus, who came down to Musa.'' And those who are possessed of insight know instinctively that among the many Books which He has sent down to His Prophets, there is no Book more perfect, more eloquent or more noble than the Book which He revealed to Muhammad , which is the Qur'an. Next to it in status and greatness is the Book which Allah revealed to Musa bin `Imran, which is the Book concerning which Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ ÃóäÒóáúäóÇ ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉó İöíåóÇ åõÏğì æóäõæÑñ íóÍúßõãõ ÈöåóÇ ÇáäøóÈöíøõæäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÓúáóãõæÇú áöáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú æóÇáÑøóÈøóÇäöíøõæäó æóÇáÇøñÍúÈóÇÑõ ÈöãóÇ ÇÓúÊõÍúİöÙõæÇú ãöä ßöÊóÜÈö Çááøóåö æóßóÇäõæÇú Úóáóíúåö ÔõåóÏóÂÁó</div><br>  (Verily, We did send down the Tawrah, therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah's will, judged for the Jews.

The Injil was revealed as a continuation and complement of the Tawrah and to permit some of the things that had been forbidden to the Children of Israel.
