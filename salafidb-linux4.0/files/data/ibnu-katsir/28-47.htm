But he was an illiterate man who could not read books, and he grew up among a people who knew nothing of such things. Similarly, Allah told him about Maryam and her story, as Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßõäÊó áóÏóíúåöãú ÅöĞú íõáúŞõæä ÃóŞúáóÜãóåõãú Ãóíøõåõãú íóßúİõáõ ãóÑúíóãó æóãóÇ ßõäÊó áóÏóíúåöãú ÅöĞú íóÎúÊóÕöãõæäó</div><br>  (You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam; nor were you with them when they disputed) (3:44), meaning, `you were not present then, but Allah has revealed this to you.' Similarly, Allah told him about Nuh and his people, and how He saved Nuh and drowned his people, then He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ãöäú ÃóäúÈóÂÁö ÇáúÛóíúÈö äõæÍöíåóÂ Åöáóíúßó ãóÇ ßõäÊó ÊóÚúáóãõåóÂ ÃóäÊó æóáÇó Şóæúãõßó ãöä ŞóÈúáö åóÜĞóÇ İóÇÕúÈöÑú Åöäøó ÇáúÚóÜŞöÈóÉó áöáúãõÊøóŞöíäó </div><br>  (This is of the news of the Unseen which We reveal unto you ; neither you nor your people knew it before this. So, be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for those who have Taqwa) (11:49).

This is like what Allah says about the situation after He revealed His blessed Book the Qur'an:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä ÊóŞõæáõæÇú ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈõ Úóáóì ØóÂÆöİóÊóíúäö ãöä ŞóÈúáöäóÇ æóÅöä ßõäøóÇ Úóä ÏöÑóÇÓóÊöåöãú áóÛóÜİöáöíäó Ãóæú ÊóŞõæáõæÇú áóæú ÃóäøóÂ ÃõäÒöáó ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈõ áóßõäøóÂ ÃóåúÏóì ãöäúåõãú İóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßõãú ÈóíøöäóÉñ ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú æóåõÏğì æóÑóÍúãóÉñ</div><br>  (Lest you should say: "The Book was sent down only to two sects before us, and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.''
