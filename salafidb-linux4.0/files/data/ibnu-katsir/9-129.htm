Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from among yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is eager for you; for the believers he is full of pity, kind, and merciful.) (129. But if they turn away, say: "Allah is sufficient for me. There is no God but He, in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.'')</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈõÚöËúÊõ ÈöÇáúÍóäöíİöíøóÉö ÇáÓøóãúÍóÉ»</div><br>  (I was sent with the easy Hanifiyah monotheism way.) An authenic Hadith mentions,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó åóĞóÇ ÇáÏøöíäó íõÓúÑ»</div><br>  (Verily, this religion is easy) and its Law is all easy, lenient and perfect. It is easy for those whom Allah the Exalted makes it easy.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÑöíÕñ Úóáóíúßõãú</div><br>  (He is eager for you), that you gain guidance and acquire benefits in this life and the Hereafter. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó áóãú íõÍóÑøöãú ÍõÑúãóÉğ ÅöáøóÇ æóŞóÏú Úóáöãó Ãóäøóåõ ÓóíóØøóáöÚõåóÇ ãöäúßõãú ãõØøóáöÚñ¡ ÃóáóÇ æóÅöäøöí ÂÎöĞñ ÈöÍõÌóÒößõãú Ãóäú ÊóåóÇİóÊõæÇ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑö ßóÊóåóÇİõÊö ÇáúİóÑóÇÔö Ãóæö ÇáĞøõÈóÇÈ»</div><br>  (Verily, every matter that Allah has prohibited, He knows that some among you will breach it; but I am indeed holding you by the waist so that you do not fall in the Fire, just like butterflies and flies.) Allah's statement next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÑóÁõæİñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful.) 9:128, is similar to His other statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÎúİöÖú ÌóäóÇÍóßó áöãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚóßó ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó - İóÅöäú ÚóÕóæúßó İóŞõáú Åöäøöì ÈóÑöìÁñ ãøöãøóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó - æóÊóæßøóáú Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÒöíÒö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö </div><br>  (And be kind and humble to the believers who follow you. Then if they disobey you, say: "I am innocent of what you do.'' And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful) 26:215-217. Allah the Exalted commanded His Messenger in this honorable Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä ÊóæóáøóæúÇú</div><br>  (But if they turn away), from the glorious, pure, perfect and encompassing Law that you -- O Muhammad -- brought them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞõáú ÍóÓúÈöìó Çááøóåõ áÇ ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó</div><br>  (then say: "Allah is sufficient for me. There is no God but He,) Allah is sufficient for me, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, and in Him I put my trust. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøóÈøõ ÇáúãóÔúÑöŞö æóÇáúãóÛúÑöÈö áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó İóÇÊøóÎöĞúåõ æóßöíáÇğ </div><br>  ((He alone is) the Lord of the east and the west; there is no God but He. So take Him alone as a guardian.) 73:9. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚóÑúÔö ÇáúÚóÙöíãö</div><br>  (and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne) 9:129. He is the King and Creator of all things, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne (`Arsh), which is above all creation; all that is in and between the heavens and earths is under the Throne (`Arsh) and subservient to Allah's power. His knowledge encompasses all things, and His decision will certainly come to pass over all matters. He is the guardian of all things. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that Ubayy bin Ka`b said, "The last Ayah revealed from the Qur'an was this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßõãú ÑóÓõæáñ ãøöäú ÃóäİõÓößõãú</div><br>  (Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from among yourselves ...) 9:128'' until the end of the Surah It is recorded in the Sahih that Zayd bin Thabit said, "I found the last Ayah in Surah Bara'ah with Khuzaymah bin Thabit.''  This is the end of Surah Bara'ah, all praise is due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
