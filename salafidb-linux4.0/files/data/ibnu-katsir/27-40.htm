So, she sent word to him saying: "I am coming to you with the leaders of my people to see what you will instruct us to do and what you are calling us to of your religion.'' Then she issued commands that her throne, which was made of gold and inlaid with rubies, chrysolite and pearls, should be placed in the innermost of seven rooms, one within the other, and all the doors should be locked. Then she told her deputy whom she was leaving in charge, "Take care of my people and my throne, and do not let anyone approach it or see it until I come back to you.'' Then she set off to meet Sulayman with twelve thousand of her commanders from the leaders of Yemen, under each of whose command were many thousands of men. Sulayman sent the Jinn to bring him news of her progress and route every day and night, then when she drew near, he gathered together the Jinns and humans who were under his control and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúãóáÃ Ãóíøõßõãú íóÃúÊöíäöì ÈöÚóÑúÔöåóÇ ŞóÈúáó Ãóä íóÃúÊõæäöì ãõÓúáöãöíäó</div><br>  (O chiefs!

Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Before you get up from where you are sitting.'' As-Suddi and others said: "He used to sit to pass judgements and rulings over the people, and to eat, from the beginning of the day until noon.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøöì Úóáóíúåö áóŞóæöìøñ Ãóãöíäñ</div><br>  (And verily, I am indeed strong and trustworthy for such work.) Ibn `Abbas said: "Strong enough to carry it and trustworthy with the jewels it contains. Sulayman, upon him be peace, said, "I want it faster than that.'' From this it seems that Sulayman wanted to bring this throne as a demonstration of the greatness of the power and authority that Allah had bestowed upon him and the troops that He had subjugated to him. Power such as had never been given to anyone else, before or since, so that this would furnish proof of his prophethood before Bilqis and her people, because this would be a great and wondrous thing, if he brought her throne as if he were in her country, before they could come to it, although it was hidden and protected by so many locked doors. When Sulayman said, "I want it faster than that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöì ÚöäÏóåõ Úöáúãñ ãøöäó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö</div><br>  (One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: ) Ibn `Abbas said, "This was Asif, the scribe of Sulayman.''
