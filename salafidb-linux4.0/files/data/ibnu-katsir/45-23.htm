At--Tabarani recorded that Shu`bah said that `Amr bin Murrah narrated that Abu Ad-Duha said that Masruq said that Tamim Ad-Dari once stood in voluntary prayer through the night until the morning only reciting this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>√угъ Ќу”ц»у «бшу–цнду «ћъ у—уЌхж«ъ «б”шуншц∆у№ ц √уд дшућъЏубуехгъ яу«бшу–цнду Ѕу«гудхж«ъ жуЏугцбхж«ъ «б’шу№бцЌу№ ц</div><br>  (Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds) Allah said in reply:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>”у¬Ѕу гу« нуЌъяхгхжду</div><br>  (Worst is the judgement that they make.)

Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жу√у÷убшуех «ббшуех Џубум Џцбъгт</div><br>  (And Allah left him astray with knowledge, ) has two meanings. One of them is that Allah knew that this person deserves to be misguided, so He left him astray. The second meaning is that Allah led this person astray after knowledge reached him and the proof was established before him. The second meaning includes the first meaning, but not the opposite. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жуќу угу Џубум ”угъЏцец жуёубъ»цец жућуЏубу Џубум »у’у—цец џц‘у№жу…р</div><br>  (and sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight.) so he does not hear what benefits him, understands not what would lead him to the guidance and sees not the evidence with which he can be enlightened. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ёугуд нуеъѕцнец гцд »уЏъѕц «ббшуец √уЁуб«у  у–уяшу—хжду</div><br>  (Who then will guide him after Allah Will you not then remember) Allah said in a similar Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>гуд нх÷ъбцбц «ббшуех Ёуб«у еу«ѕцну буех жуну–у—хехгъ Ёцм Ўхџъну№дцецгъ нуЏъгуехжду </div><br>  (Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him; and He lets them wander blindly in their transgressions.)
