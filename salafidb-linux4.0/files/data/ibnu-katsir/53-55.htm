Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Amr bin Maymun Al-Awdi said, "Once, Mu`adh bin Jabal stood up among us and said, `O Children of Awd! I am the emissary of Allah's Messenger to you; know that the Return is to Allah, either to Paradise or the Fire.''' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõ åõæó ÃóÖúÍóßó æóÃóÈúßóì </div><br>  (And that it is He Who makes you laugh, and makes you weep.) means that He created in His creatures the ability to laugh or weep and the causes for each of these opposites,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõ åõæó ÃóãóÇÊó æóÃóÍúíóÇ </div><br>  (And that it is He Who causes death and gives life.) In a similar statement, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó ÇáúãóæúÊó æóÇáúÍóíóæÉó</div><br>  (Who has created death and life.)(67:2) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõ ÎóáóŞó ÇáÒøóæúÌóíúäö ÇáĞøóßóÑó æóÇáÇøòäËóì - ãöä äøõØúİóÉò ÅöĞóÇ Êõãúäóì </div><br>  (And that He creates the pairs, male and female.

And made of him two sexes, male and female. Is not He (Allah) able to give life to the dead)(75:36-40) Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó Úóáóíúåö ÇáäøóÔúÃóÉó ÇáÇøòÎúÑóì </div><br>  (And that upon Him is another bringing forth.) meaning, just as He first originated creation, He is able to bring it back to life, resurrecting it for the Day of Judgement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõ åõæó ÃóÛúäóì æóÃóŞúäóì </div><br>  (And that it is He Who Aghna (gives much) and Aqna (a little).) It is Allah Who gives wealth to His servants and this wealth remains with them. This means they are able to use it to their benefit, is this out of the completeness of His favor. Most of the statements of the scholars of Tafsir revolve around this meaning, such as those from Abu Salih, Ibn Jarir and others. Mujahid said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÛúäóì</div><br>  (Aghna) meaning: He gives wealth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóŞúäóì</div><br>  (Aqna) meaning: He gives servants. Similar was said by Qatadah. Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÛúäóì</div><br>  (Aghna) means: He granted; while,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóŞúäóì</div><br>  (Aqna) means: He gave contentment.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõ åõæó ÑóÈøõ ÇáÔøöÚúÑóì </div><br>  (And that He is the Lord of Ash-Shi`ra.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said about Ash-Shi`ra that it is the bright star, named Mirzam Al-Jawza' (Sirius), which a group of Arabs used to worship.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõ Ãóåúáóßó ÚóÇÏÇğ ÇáÇøòæáóì </div><br>  (And that it is He Who destroyed the former `Ad) the people of Hud. They are the descendants of `Ad, son of Iram, son of Sam, son of Nuh. As Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑó ßóíúİó İóÚóáó ÑóÈøõßó ÈöÚóÇÏò - ÅöÑóãó ĞóÇÊö ÇáúÚöãóÇÏö - ÇáøóÊöì áóãú íõÎúáóŞú ãöËúáõåóÇ İöì ÇáúÈöáóÜÏö </div><br>  (Saw you not how your Lord dealt with `Ad. Of Iram, with the lofty pillars, the like of which were not created in the land)(89:6-8) The people of `Ad were among the strongest, fiercest people and the most rebellious against Allah the Exalted and His Messenger. Allah destroyed them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÑöíÍò ÕóÑúÕóÑò ÚóÇÊöíóÉòÓóÎøóÑóåóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ÓóÈúÚó áóíóÇáò æóËóãóÜäöíóÉó ÃóíøóÇãò ÍõÓõæãÇğ</div><br>  (By a furious violent wind! Which Allah imposed in them for seven nights and eight days in succession.)(69:6-7) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóËóãõæÏó İóãóÂ ÃóÈúŞóì </div><br>  (And Thamud. He spared none), declares that He destroyed them all and spared none of them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóæúãó äõæÍò ãøöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (And the people of Nuh aforetime.) before `Ad and Thamud,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõãú ßóÇäõæÇú åõãú ÃóÙúáóãó æóÃóØúÛóì</div><br>  (Verily, they were more unjust and more rebellious and transgressing.) more unjust in disobeying Allah than those who came after them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõÄúÊóİößóÉó Ãóåúæóì </div><br>  (And He destroyed the overthrown cities.) meaning, the cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah) to which Prophet Lut was sent. Allah turned their cities upside down over them and sent on them stones of Sijjil. Allah's statement that whatever has covered it, has covered it, is like the case with the stones of Sijjil that He sent on them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãúØóÑúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöã ãøóØóÑÇğ İóÓóÂÁó ãóØóÑõ ÇáúãõäĞóÑöíäó </div><br>  (And We rained on them a rain (of torment). And how evil was the rain of those who had been warned!)(26:173) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöÃóìøö ÂáÇÁö ÑóÈøößó ÊóÊóãóÇÑóì </div><br>  (Then which of the graces of your Lord will you doubt) meaning, `which of Allah's favors for you, O man, do you doubt,' according to Qatadah. Ibn Jurayj said that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöÃóìøö ÂáÇÁö ÑóÈøößó ÊóÊóãóÇÑóì </div><br>  (Then which of the graces of your Lord will you doubt), is directed towards the Prophet saying: "O Muhammad!'' However, the first ex- planation is better, and it is the meaning that Ibn Jarir preferred.  </div></body></html>
