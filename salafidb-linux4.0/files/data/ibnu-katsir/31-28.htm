No human being knows their essence or nature, or how many they are. As the Leader of Mankind and Seal of the Messengers said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÃõÍúÕöí ËóäóÇÁğ Úóáóíúßó ÃóäúÊó ßóãóÇ ÃóËúäóíúÊó Úóáóì äóİúÓöß»</div><br>  (I cannot praise You enough; You are as You have praised yourself.) Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÃóäøóãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ãöä ÔóÌóÑóÉò ÃóŞúáÇóãñ æóÇáúÈóÍúÑõ íóãõÏøõåõ ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåö ÓóÈúÚóÉõ ÃóÈúÍõÑò ãøóÇ äóİöÏóÊú ßóáöãóÜÊõ Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea, with seven seas behind it to add to its, yet the Words of Allah would not be exhausted.) meaning, even if all the trees on earth were made into pens and the sea was made into ink, and topped up with seven more like it, and they were used to write the Words of Allah showing His might, attributes and majesty, the pens would break and the ink would run dry, even if more were brought. The number seven is used to indicate a large amount, it is not to be taken literally or to be understood as referring to the seven oceans of the world, as was suggested by those who took this idea from Israelite stories, which we neither believe nor reject. As Allah says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõá áøóæú ßóÇäó ÇáúÈóÍúÑõ ãöÏóÇÏÇğ áøößóáöãóÜÊö ÑóÈøöì áóäóİöÏó ÇáúÈóÍúÑõ ŞóÈúáó Ãóä ÊóäİóÏó ßóáöãóÜÊõ ÑóÈøöì æóáóæú ÌöÆúäóÇ ÈöãöËúáöåö ãóÏóÏÇğ </div><br>  (Say: "If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if We brought like it for its aid.'') (18:109). The words   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöãöËúáöåö</div><br>  (like it) do not mean merely another one, but another like it and another and another and another, etc., because there is no limit to the signs and Words of Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøó Çááøóåó ÚóÒöíÒñ Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.) means, He is All-Mighty and has subjugated all things to His will, so nothing can prevent what He wills, and none can oppose or put back His decision. He is All-Wise in His creation, commands, Words, actions, Laws and all His affairs.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ ÎóáúŞõßõãú æóáÇó ÈóÚúËõßõãú ÅöáÇøó ßóäóİúÓò æóÍöÏóÉò</div><br>  (The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person.) means, His creation and resurrection of all of mankind on the Day of Resurrection is, in relation to His power, like the creation and resurrection of a single soul; all of this is easy for Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóãúÑõåõ ÅöĞóÂ ÃóÑóÇÏó ÔóíúÆÇğ Ãóä íóŞõæáó áóåõ ßõä İóíóßõæäõ </div><br>  (Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, "Be!'' -- and it is!) (36:82)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóãúÑõäóÂ ÅöáÇøó æóÍöÏóÉñ ßóáóãúÍò ÈöÇáúÈóÕóÑö </div><br>  (And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye. ) (54:50). This means He only has to command a thing once, and it will happen. There is no need for Him to repeat it or confirm it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóãóÇ åöìó ÒóÌúÑóÉñ æóÍöÏóÉñ - İóÅöĞóÇ åõã ÈöÇáÓøóÇåöÑóÉö </div><br>  (But it will be only a single Zajrah. When behold, they find themselves on the surface of the earth alive after their death.)(79:13)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÓóãöíÚñ ÈóÕöíÑñ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer.) means, just as He hears all that they say, so He also sees all that they do, as if He is hearing and seeing a single soul. His power over all of them is like His power over a single soul, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ ÎóáúŞõßõãú æóáÇó ÈóÚúËõßõãú ÅöáÇøó ßóäóİúÓò æóÍöÏóÉò</div><br>  (The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person.)  </div></body></html>
