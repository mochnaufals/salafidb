Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú íóáúÈöÓóßõãú ÔöíóÚÇğ</div><br>  (or to cover you with confusion in party strife, ) means, He causes you to be in disarray and separate into opposing parties and groups. Al-Walibi (`Ali bin Abi Talhah) reported that Ibn `Abbas said that this Ayah refers to desires. Mujahid and several others said similarly.
