He (the father) said: "O my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they should arrange a plot against you. Verily, Shaytan is to man an open enemy!'')</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Ya`qub orders Yusuf to hide His Vision to avoid Shaytan's Plots</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah narrates the reply Ya`qub gave his son Yusuf when he narrated to him the vision that he saw, which indicated that his brothers would be under his authority. They would be subjugated to Yusuf's authority to such an extent that they would prostrate before him in respect, honor and appreciation. Ya`qub feared that if Yusuf narrated his vision to any of his brothers, they would envy him and conspire evil plots against him. This is why Ya`qub said to Yusuf,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊóŞúÕõÕú ÑõÁúíóÇßó Úóáóì ÅöÎúæóÊößó İóíóßöíÏõæÇú áóßó ßóíúÏğÇ</div><br>  (Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they should arrange a plot against you.) This Ayah means, "They might arrange a plot against you that causes your demise.'' In the Sunnah, there is a confirmed Hadith that states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóì ÃóÍóÏõßõãú ãóÇ íõÍöÈøõ İóáúíõÍóÏøöËú Èöåö¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóì ãóÇ íóßúÑóåõ İóáúíóÊóÍóæøóáú Åöáóì ÌóäúÈöåö ÇáúÂÎóÑö¡ æóáúíóÊúİõáú Úóäú íóÓóÇÑöåö ËóáóÇËğÇ¡ æóáúíóÓúÊóÚöĞú ÈöÇááåö ãöäú ÔóÑøöåóÇ¡ æóáóÇ íõÍóÏøöËú ÈöåóÇ ÃóÍóÏğÇ İóÅöäøóåóÇ áóäú ÊóÖõÑøóå»</div><br>  (If any of you saw a vision that he likes, let him narrate it. If he saw a dream that he dislikes, let him turn on his other side, blow to his left thrice, seek refuge with Allah from its evil and not tell it to anyone. Verily, it will not harm him in this case.) In another Hadith that Imam Ahmad and collectors of the Sunan collected, Mu`awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÑøõÄúíóÇ Úóáóì ÑöÌúáö ØóÇÆöÑò ãóÇ áóãú ÊõÚúÈóÑú¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ÚõÈöÑóÊú æóŞóÚóÊ»</div><br>  (The dream is tied to a bird's leg, as long as it is not interpreted. If it is interpreted, it comes true.) Therefore, one should hide the prospects or the coming of a bounty until it comes into existence and becomes known. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÓúÊóÚöíäõæÇ Úóáóì ŞóÖóÇÁö ÇáúÍóæóÇÆöÌö ÈößöÊúãóÇäöåóÇ¡ İóÅöäøó ßõáøó Ğöí äöÚúãóÉò ãóÍúÓõæÏ»</div><br>  (Earn help for fulfilling needs by being discrete, for every owner of a blessing is envied.)  </div></body></html>
