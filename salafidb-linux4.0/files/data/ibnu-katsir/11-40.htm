It is related from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "At-Tannur is the face of the earth.'' This verse means that the face of the earth became gushing water springs. This continued until the water gushed forth from the Tananir, which are places of fire. Therefore, water even gushed from the places where fire normally would be. This is the opinion of the majority of the Salaf (predecessors) and the scholars of the Khalaf (later generations). At this point, Allah commanded Nuh to select one pair from every kind of creature possessing a soul, and load them on the ship. Some said that this included other creatures as well, such as pairs of plants, male and female. It has also been said that the first of the birds to enter the ship was the parrot, and the last of the animals to enter was the donkey. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóåúáóßó ÅöáÇøó ãóä ÓóÈóŞó Úóáóíúåö ÇáúŞóæúáõ</div><br>  (and your family -- except him against whom the Word has already gone forth)  This means, "Load your family upon the ship.'' This is referring to the members of his household and his relatives, except him against whom the Word has already gone forth, for they did not believe in Allah. Among them was the son of Nuh, Yam, who went in hermitage. Among them was the wife of Nuh who was a disbeliever in Allah and His Messenger. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäú ÁóÇãóäó</div><br>  (and those who believe.) from your people.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÁóÇãóäó ãóÚóåõ ÅöáÇøó Şóáöíáñ</div><br>  (And none believed with him, except a few.) This means that only a very small number believed, even after the long period of time that he (Nuh) was among them -- nine hundred and fifty years. It is reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "They were eighty people including their women.''  </div></body></html>
