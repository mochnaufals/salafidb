Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóæúãó ÊóŞõæãõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ</div><br>  (And on the Day that the Hour will be established) on the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÎúÓóÑõ ÇáúãõÈúØöáõæäó</div><br>  (the followers of falsehood shall lose.) those who disbelieve in Allah and reject the clear proofs and unequivocal evidences that He has sent down to His Messengers.

It was said that this will occur when Hellfire will be brought forth, for she will exhale once, and everyone will fall to their knees, including Ibrahim, the Khalil. He will proclaim, "Myself, myself, myself! Today, I will not ask You (O Allah) but about myself.'' And even `Isa, will proclaim, "Today, I will only argue before You on my own behalf, I will not ask You about Maryam, who gave birth to me.'' Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøõ ÃãøóÉò ÊõÏúÚóì Åöáóì ßöÊóÜÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (each nation will be called to its Record. ) meaning, Record of deeds.

(18:49) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ äóÓúÊóäÓöÎõ ãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, We were recording what you used to do.) means, `We ordered Our scribe angels to record your deeds.' Ibn `Abbas and others commented, "The angels record the deeds of the servants and then ascend to heaven with them. There, they meet the angels entrusted with the Records of deeds sent down from Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz on each Night of Al-Qadr, containing what Allah has written will occur from the servants, long before He created them. They will compare their records and find out that not a single letter was added or deleted.'' He then recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ äóÓúÊóäÓöÎõ ãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, We were recording what you used to do.)  </div></body></html>
