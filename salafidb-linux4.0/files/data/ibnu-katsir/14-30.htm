Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu At-Tufayl said that Ibn Al-Kawwa' asked `Ali about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÈóÏøóáõæÇú äöÚúãóÊó Çááøóåö ßõİúÑğÇ æóÃóÍóáøõæÇú Şóæúãóåõãú ÏóÇÑó ÇáúÈóæóÇÑö</div><br>  (those who have changed the blessings of Allah into disbelief, and caused their people to dwell in the house of destruction) and `Ali said that it refers to the disbelievers of Quraysh on the day of Badr. He also said that the blessing of Allah was faith that came to the polytheists of Quraysh, and they changed this blessing into disbelief and led their people to utter destruction. This includes all disbelievers, for Allah sent Muhammad as a mercy and a blessing to all mankind. Those who accepted this blessing and were thankful for it, will enter Paradise, while those who denied it and disbelieved in it, will enter the Fire.
