Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Mujahid said, "They disputed with the believers after they responded to Allah and His Messenger, and tried to prevent them from following the path of guidance, hoping that they would return to Jahiliyyah.'' Qatadah said, "These were the Jews and Christians who said to them, `Our religion is better than your religion, our Prophet came before your Prophet, and we are better than you and closer to Allah than you. ''' This was nothing but lies. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì ÃóäÒóáó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (It is Allah Who has sent down the Book in truth,) referring to all the Books which were revealed from Him to His Prophets.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãöíÒóÇäó</div><br>  (and the Balance.) means, justice and fairness. This was the view of Mujahid and Qatadah. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ÑõÓõáóäóÇ ÈöÇáúÈóíøöäóÜÊö æóÃóäÒóáúäóÇ ãóÚóåõãõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó æóÇáúãöíÒóÇäó áöíóŞõæãó ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÈöÇáúŞöÓúØö</div><br>  (Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance that mankind may keep up justice) (57:25).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóãóÂÁó ÑóİóÚóåóÇ æóæóÖóÚó ÇáúãöíÒóÇäó - ÃóáÇøó ÊóØúÛóæúÇú İöì ÇáúãöíÒóÇäö - æóÃóŞöíãõæÇú ÇáúæóÒúäó ÈöÇáúŞöÓúØö æóáÇó ÊõÎúÓöÑõæÇú ÇáúãöíÒóÇäó </div><br>  (And the heaven He has raised high, and He has set up the Balance.

It was reported through various chains of narration, a number reaching the level of being Mutawatir, in Sahih and Hasan narrations, in the Books of Sunan and Musnad. According to some versions, a man addressed the Messenger of Allah in a loud voice, when he was on one of his journeys, calling out to him, "O Muhammad!'' The Messenger of Allah replied in a similar manner, "Here I am!'' The man said, "When will the Hour come'' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóíúÍóßó ÅöäøóåóÇ ßóÇÆöäóÉñ İóãóÇ ÃóÚúÏóÏúÊó áóåóÇ¿»</div><br>  (Woe to you! It will most certainly come. What have you done to prepare for it) He said, "Love for Allah and His Messenger.'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÊó ãóÚó ãóäú ÃóÍúÈóÈúÊ»</div><br>  (You will be with those whom you love.) According to another Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúãóÑúÁõ ãóÚó ãóäú ÃóÍóÈ»</div><br>  ("A man will be with those whom he loves.) This is Mutawatir beyond a doubt. The point is that he did not answer his question about when the Hour would happen, but he commanded him to prepare for it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇó Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íõãóÇÑõæäó İóì ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö</div><br>  (Verily, those who dispute concerning the Hour) means, who dispute whether it will happen and think it is unlikely ever to come,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóİöì ÖóáóÜáó ÈóÚöíÏò</div><br>  (are certainly in error far away.) means, they are clearly ignorant, because the One Who created the heavens and the earth is even more able to give life to the dead, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íóÈúÏóÃõ ÇáúÎóáúŞó Ëõãøó íõÚöíÏõåõ æóåõæó Ãóåúæóäõ Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him) (30:27).  </div></body></html>
