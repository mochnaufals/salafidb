The Arabic language is the most eloquent, plain, deep and expressive of the meanings that might arise in one's mind. Therefore, the most honorable Book, was revealed in the most honorable language, to the most honorable Prophet and Messenger , delivered by the most honorable angel, in the most honorable land on earth, and its revelation started during the most honorable month of the year, Ramadan. Therefore, the Qur'an is perfect in every respect. So Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÍúäõ äóŞõÕøõ Úóáóíúßó ÃóÍúÓóäó ÇáúŞóÕóÕö ÈöãóÂ ÃóæúÍóíúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäó</div><br>  (We relate unto you the best of stories through Our revelations unto you, of this Qur'an.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Reason behind revealing Ayah (12:3)</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  On the reason behind revealing Ayah (12:3), Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said, "They said, `O, Allah's Messenger! Why not narrate to us stories' Later on, this Ayah was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÍúäõ äóŞõÕøõ Úóáóíúßó ÃóÍúÓóäó ÇáúŞóÕóÕö</div><br>  (We relate unto you the best of stories...)'' There is a Hadith that is relevant upon mentioning this honorable Ayah, which praises the Qur'an and demonstrates that it is sufficient from needing all books besides it. Imam Ahmad recorded a narration from Jabir bin `Abdullah that `Umar bin Al-Khattab came to the Prophet with a book that he took from some of the People of the Book. `Umar began reading it to the Prophet who became angry. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãõÊóåóæøößõæäó İöíåóÇ íóÇ ÇÈúäó ÇáúÎóØøóÇÈö¿ æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö¡ áóŞóÏú ÌöÆúÊõßõãú ÈöåóÇ ÈóíúÖóÇÁó äóŞöíøóÉğ¡ áóÇ ÊóÓúÃóáõæåõãú Úóäú ÔóíúÁò İóíõÎúÈöÑõæßõãú ÈöÍóŞó İóÊõßóĞøöÈõæäóåõ¡ Ãóæú ÈöÈóÇØöáò İóÊõÕóÏøöŞõæäóåõ¡ æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö¡ áóæú Ãóäøó ãõæÓóì ßóÇäó ÍóíøğÇ ãóÇ æóÓöÚóåõ ÅöáøóÇ Ãóäú íóÊøóÈöÚóäöí»</div><br>  (Are you uncertain about it Ibn Al-Khattab By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! I have come to you with it white and pure. Do not ask them about anything, for they might tell you something true and you reject it, or they might tell you something false and you believe it. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul! If Musa were living, he would have no choice but to follow me.) Imam Ahmad also recorded a narration from `Abdullah bin Thabit who said, "`Umar came to Allah's Messenger and said; `O Messenger of Allah! I passed by a brother of mine from the tribe of Qurayzah, so he wrote some comprehensive statements from the Tawrah for me, should I read them to you' The face of Allah's Messenger changed with anger. So I said to him, `Don't you see the face of Allah's Messenger'' `Umar said, `We are pleased with Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion, and Muhammad as our Messenger.' So the anger of the Prophet subsided, and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓõ ãõÍóãøóÏò ÈöíóÏöåö¡ áóæú ÃóÕúÈóÍó İöíßõãú ãõæÓóì Ëõãøó ÇÊøóÈóÚúÊõãõæåõ æóÊóÑóßúÊõãõæäöí áóÖóáóáúÊõãú¡ Åöäøóßõãú ÍóÙøöí ãöäó ÇáúÃõãóãö¡ æóÃóäóÇ ÍóÙøõßõãú ãöäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíä»</div><br>  (By the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad's soul, if Musa appeared among you and you were to follow him, abandoning me, then you would have strayed. Indeed you are my share of the nations, and I am your share of the Prophets.)''  </div></body></html>
