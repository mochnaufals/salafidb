We wish that our souls be returned to our bodies so that we are killed in Your cause again.' Allah knew that they did not have any other wish, so they were left.)''' There are several other similar narrations from Anas and Abu Sa`id.

Abu Bakr Ibn Marduwyah recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, "The Messenger of Allah looked at me one day and said, `O Jabir! Why do I see you sad' I said, `O Messenger of Allah!

Ahmad and Ibn Jarir collected this Hadith, which has a good chain of narration. It appears that the martyrs are of different types, some of them wander in Paradise, and some remain close to this river by the door of Paradise. It is also possible that the river is where all the souls of the martyrs convene and where they are provided with their provision day and night, and Allah knows best. UImam Ahmad narrated a Hadith that contains good news for every believer that his soul will be wandering in Paradise, as well, eating from its fruits, enjoying its delights and happiness and tasting the honor that Allah has prepared in it for him. This Hadith has a unique, authentic chain of narration that includes three of the Four Imams. Imam Ahmad narrated this Hadith from Muhammad bin Idris Ash-Shafi`i who narrated it from Malik bin Anas Al-Asbuhi, from Az-Zuhri, from `Abdur-Rahman bin Ka`b bin Malik that his father said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÓóãóÉõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäö ØóÇÆöÑñ íóÚúáõŞõ İöí ÔóÌóÑö ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉö ÍóÊøóì íóÑúÌöÚóåõ Çááåõ Åöáì ÌóÓóÏöåö íóæúãó íóÈúÚóËõå»</div><br>  (The soul of the believer becomes a bird that feeds on the trees of Paradise, until Allah sends him back to his body when He resurrects him.)  This Hadith states that the souls of the believers are in the shape of a bird in Paradise. As for the souls of martyrs, they are inside green birds, like the stars to the rest of the believing souls. We ask Allah the Most Generous that He makes us firm on the faith.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÑöÍöíäó ÈöãóÂ ÁóÇÊóÜåõãõ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them) indicates that the martyrs who were killed in Allah's cause are alive with Allah, delighted because of the bounty and happiness they are enjoying. They are also awaiting their brethren, who will die in Allah's cause after them, for they will be meeting them soon. These martyrs do not have fear about the future or sorrow for what they left behind. We ask Allah to grant us Paradise. The Two Sahihs record from Anas, the story of the seventy Ansar Companions who were murdered at Bir Ma`unah in one night. In this Hadith, Anas reported that the Prophet used to supplicate to Allah in Qunut in prayer against those who killed them. Anas said, "A part of the Qur'an was revealed about them, but was later abrogated, `Convey to our people that we met Allah and He was pleased with us and made us pleased.'''  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÊóÈúÔöÑõæäó ÈöäöÚúãóÉò ãøöäó Çááøóåö æóİóÖúáò æóÃóäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íõÖöíÚõ ÃóÌúÑó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (They rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers) 3:171.  Muhammad bin Ishaq commented, "They were delighted and pleased because of Allah's promise that was fulfilled for them, and for the tremendous rewards they earned.'' `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, "This Ayah encompasses all the believers, martyrs and otherwise. Rarely does Allah mention a bounty and a reward that He granted to the Prophets, without following that with what He has granted the believers after them.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Battle of Hamra' Al-Asad</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÓúÊóÌóÇÈõæÇú áöáøóåö æóÇáÑøóÓõæáö ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÂ ÃóÕóÜÈóåõãõ ÇáúŞóÑúÍõ</div><br>  (Those who answered (the Call of) Allah and the Messenger after being wounded) 3:172.  This occurred on the day of Hamra' Al-Asad. After the idolators defeated the Muslims (at Uhud), they started on their way back home, but soon they were concerned because they did not finish off the Muslims in Al-Madinah, so they set out to make that battle the final one. When the Messenger of Allah got news of this, he commanded the Muslims to march to meet the disbelievers, to bring fear to their hearts and to demonstrate that the Muslims still had strength to fight. The Prophet only allowed those who were present during Uhud to accompany him, except for Jabir bin `Abdullah Al-Ansari, as we will mention. The Muslims mobilized, even though they were still suffering from their injuries, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger .  Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ikrimah said, "When the idolators returned towards Makkah after Uhud, they said, `You neither killed Muhammad nor collected female captives. Woe to you for what you did. Let us go back.' When the Messenger of Allah heard this news, he mobilized the Muslim forces, and they marched until they reached Hamra Al-Asad. The idolators said, `Rather, we will meet next year', and the Messenger of Allah went back to Al-Madinah, and this was considered a Ghazwah (battle). Allah sent down,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÓúÊóÌóÇÈõæÇú áöáøóåö æóÇáÑøóÓõæáö ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÂ ÃóÕóÜÈóåõãõ ÇáúŞóÑúÍõ áöáøóĞöíäó ÃóÍúÓóäõæÇú ãöäúåõãú æóÇÊøóŞóæúÇú ÃóÌúÑñ ÚóÙöíãñ </div><br>  (Those who answered (the Call of) Allah and the Messenger after being wounded; for those of them who did good deeds and feared Allah, there is a great reward.)

But it only increased them in faith, and they said, `Allah is Sufficient for us and He is the Best Disposer of affairs for us.''' Abu Bakr Ibn Marduwyah recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Prophet was told on the day of Uhud, "Verily, the people have gathered against you, therefore, fear them.'' Thereafter, Allah sent down this Ayah 3:173.
