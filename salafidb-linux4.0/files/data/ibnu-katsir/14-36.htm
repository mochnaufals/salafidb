He also states that Ibrahim, who establsihed the city, has disowned those who worship others besides Allah, and that he begged Allah to make Makkah peaceful and secure,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö ÇÌúÚóáú åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúÈóáóÏó ÂãöäğÇ</div><br>  (O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) of peace and security,) and Allah accepted his supplication. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæóáóãú íóÑóæúÇú ÃóäøóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ ÍóÑóãÇğ ÁÇãöäÇğ</div><br>  (Have they not seen that We have made (Makkah) a secure sanctuary.) 29:67 and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Ãóæøóáó ÈóíúÊò æõÖöÚó áöáäøóÇÓö áóáøóĞöì ÈöÈóßøóÉó ãõÈóÇÑóßÇğ æóåõÏğì áøöáúÚóÜáóãöíäó İöíåö ÁóÇíóÜÊñ ÈóíøöÜäóÜÊñ ãøóŞóÇãõ ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóãóä ÏóÎóáóåõ ßóÇäó ÁóÇãöäÇğ</div><br>  (Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-'Alamin. In it are manifest signs, the Maqam of Ibrahim; whosoever enters it, he attains security.)3:96 Allah said here that Ibrahim supplicated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö ÇÌúÚóáú åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúÈóáóÏó ÂãöäğÇ</div><br>  (O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) a of peace and security, ) saying, "this city'', after he established it, and this is why he said afterwards,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö ÇáøóĞöì æóåóÈó áöì Úóáóì ÇáúßöÈóÑö ÅöÓúãóÜÚöíáó æóÅöÓúÍóÜŞó</div><br>  (All praise is due to Allah, Who has given me in old age Isma`il and Ishaq.) 14:39 It is well-known that Isma`il was thirteen years older than Ishaq. When Ibrahim took Isma`il and his mother to Makkah, while Isma`il was still young enough to nurse, he supplicated to Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö ÇÌúÚóáú åóÜĞóÇ ÈóáóÏğÇ ÂãöäğÇ</div><br>  (O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) a place of peace and security.) 2:126 as we in explained in Surat Al-Baqarah. Ibrahim then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÌúäõÈúäöì æóÈóäöìøó Ãóä äøóÚúÈõÏó ÇáÇøñÕúäóÇãó</div><br>  (and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.) It is proper for whoever supplicates to Allah to also ask for the benefit of his parents and offspring, as well as himself. Ibrahim next mentioned that many among mankind were led astray because of idols, and he disowned those who worship them and referred their matter to Allah; if Allah wills, He will punish them, and if He wills, He will forgive them. `Isa, peace be upon him, said similar words,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊõÚóĞøöÈúåõãú İóÅöäøóåõãú ÚöÈóÇÏõßó æóÅöä ÊóÛúİöÑú áóåõãú İóÅöäøóßó ÃóäÊó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÍóßöíãõ </div><br>  (If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.)5:118 This supplication refers this and all matters to Allah, not that it is actually going to happen. `Abdullah bin `Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah recited Ibrahim's supplication,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö Åöäøóåõäøó ÃóÖúáóáúäó ßóËöíÑğÇ ãøöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind.), and the supplication of `Isa,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊõÚóĞøöÈúåõãú İóÅöäøóåõãú ÚöÈóÇÏõßó</div><br>  (If You punish them, they are Your servants.) 5:118 then raised his hands and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó ÃõãøóÊöí¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÃõãøóÊöí¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÃõãøóÊöí»</div><br>  (O Allah, Save my Ummah! O, Allah, Save my Ummah! O, Allah, Save my Ummah!) and cried. Allah said to the angel Jibril, "O Jibril, go to Muhammad, and Your Lord has more knowledge, and ask him what makes him cry.'' Jibril came to the Prophet and asked him, and he repeated to him what he said (in his supplication). Allah said, "Go to Muhammad and tell him this; `We will make you pleased with your Ummah, O Muhammad, and will not treat them in a way you dislike.'''  </div></body></html>
