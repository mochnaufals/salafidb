This is why Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÎóíúÑñ áøóßõãú æóÃóØúåóÑõ</div><br>  (That will be better and purer for you.) then He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä áøóãú ÊóÌöÏõæÇú</div><br>  (But if you find not.) meaning, if he is unable to do so due to poverty,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (then verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) He only commanded those who are financially able to give this type of charity. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁóÔúİóŞúÊõãú Ãóä ÊõŞóÏøöãõæÇú Èóíúäó íóÏóìú äóÌúæóßõãú ÕóÏóŞóÜÊò</div><br>  (Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation) meaning, are you afraid that the order to give charity before speaking privately to the Prophet remains in effect forever   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞú áóãú ÊóİúÚóáõæÇú æóÊóÇÈó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúßõãú İóÃóŞöíãõæÇú ÇáÕøóáæÉó æóÁóÇÊõæÇú ÇáÒøóßóæÉó æóÃóØöíÚõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ æóÇááøóåõ ÎóÈöíÑñ ÈöãóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (If then you do it not, and Allah has forgiven you, then perform Salah and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) Therefore, Allah abrogated the obligation of giving this charity. It was said that none has implemented this command before except its abrogation, `Ali bin Abi Talib. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóÏøöãõæÇú Èóíúäó íóÏóìú äóÌúæóßõãú ÕóÏóŞóÉğ</div><br>  (spend something in charity before your private consultation.) "The Muslims kept asking Allah's Messenger questions until it became difficult on him. Allah wanted to lighten the burden from His Prophet , upon him be peace. So when He said this, many Muslims were afraid to pay this charity and stopped asking. Afterwards, Allah sent down this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁóÔúİóŞúÊõãú Ãóä ÊõŞóÏøöãõæÇú Èóíúäó íóÏóìú äóÌúæóßõãú ÕóÏóŞóÜÊò İóÅöĞú áóãú ÊóİúÚóáõæÇú æóÊóÇÈó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúßõãú İóÃóŞöíãõæÇú ÇáÕøóáæÉó æóÁóÇÊõæÇú ÇáÒøóßóæÉó</div><br>  (Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation If then you do it not, and Allah has forgiven you, then perform Salah and give Zakah) Thus Allah made things easy and lenient for them.'' `Ikrimah and Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented on Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóÏøöãõæÇú Èóíúäó íóÏóìú äóÌúæóßõãú ÕóÏóŞóÉğ</div><br>  (spend something in charity before your private consultation.) "This was abrogated by the next Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁóÔúİóŞúÊõãú Ãóä ÊõŞóÏøöãõæÇú Èóíúäó íóÏóìú äóÌúæóßõãú ÕóÏóŞóÜÊò</div><br>  (Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation...).'' Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah reported from Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan, "People kept questioning Allah's Messenger until they made things difficult for him. Allah provided a way to stop their behavior by this Ayah. One of them would need to speak to Allah's Prophet about a real matter, but could not do so until he gave in charity. This became hard on people and Allah sent down relief from this requirement afterwards,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä áøóãú ÊóÌöÏõæÇú İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (But if you find not, then verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful).''  Ma`mar reported from Qatadah that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ äóÜÌóíúÊõãõ ÇáÑøóÓõæáó İóŞóÏøöãõæÇú Èóíúäó íóÏóìú äóÌúæóßõãú ÕóÏóŞóÉğ</div><br>  (When you (want to) consult the Messenger in private, spend something in charity before your private consultation.) was abrogated after being in effect for only one hour of a day. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Mujahid said that `Ali said, "No one except me implemented this Ayah, until it was abrogated,'' and he was reported to have said that it remained in effect for merely an hour.  </div></body></html>
