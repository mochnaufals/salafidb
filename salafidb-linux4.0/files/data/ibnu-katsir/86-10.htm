Thus, He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóãóÂÁö æóÇáØøóÇÑöŞö </div><br>  (By the heaven, and At-Tariq;) Then He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÏúÑóÇßó ãóÇ ÇáØøóÇÑöŞõ </div><br>  (And what will make you to know what At-Tariq is) Then He explains it by His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáäøóÌúãõ ÇáËøóÇŞöÈõ </div><br>  (The star of Ath-Thaqib.) Qatadah and others have said, "The star has been named Tariq because it is only seen at night and it is hidden during the day.'' His view is supported by what has been mentioned in the authentic Hadith that prohibits a man to come to his family Taruq. This means that he comes to them unexpectedly at nighttime. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáËøóÇŞöÈõ</div><br>  (Ath-Thaqib.) Ibn `Abbas said, "The illuminating.'' `Ikrimah said, "It is illuminating and it burns the Shaytan'' Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ßõáøõ äóİúÓò áøóãøóÇ ÚóáóíúåóÇ ÍóÇİöÙñ </div><br>  (There is no human being but has a protector over him.) meaning, every soul has a guardian over it from Allah that protects it from the calamities. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõ ãõÚóŞøöÈóÜÊñ ãøöä Èóíúäö íóÏóíúåö æóãöäú Îóáúİöåö íóÍúİóÙõæäóåõ ãöäú ÃóãúÑö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (For Him, there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allah.) (13:11) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>How Man is created is a Proof of Allah's Ability to Return Him to Him</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáúíóäÙõÑö ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ ãöãøó ÎõáöŞó </div><br>  (So, let man see from what he is created!) This is alerting man to the weakness of his origin from which he was created. The intent of it is to guide man to accept (the reality of) the Hereafter, because whoever is able to begin the creation then he is also able to repeat it in the same way. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íóÈúÏóÃõ ÇáúÎóáúŞó Ëõãøó íõÚöíÏõåõ æóåõæó Ãóåúæóäõ Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) (30:27) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎõáöŞó ãöä ãøóÂÁò ÏóÇİöŞò </div><br>  (He is created from a water gushing forth.) meaning, the sexual fluid that comes out bursting forth from the man and the woman. Thus, the child is produced from both of them by the permission of Allah. Due to this Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÎúÑõÌõ ãöä Èóíúäö ÇáÕøõáúÈö æóÇáÊøóÑóÂÆöÈö </div><br>  (Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.) meaning, the backbone (or loins) of the man and the ribs of the woman, which is referring to her chest. Shabib bin Bishr reported from `Ikrimah who narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÎúÑõÌõ ãöä Èóíúäö ÇáÕøõáúÈö æóÇáÊøóÑóÂÆöÈö </div><br>  (Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.) "The backbone of the man and the ribs of the woman. It (the fluid) is yellow and fine in texture. The child will not be born except from both of them (i.e., their sexual fluids).''  Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ Úóáóì ÑóÌúÚöåö áóŞóÇÏöÑñ </div><br>  (Verily, He is Able to bring him back (to life)!) This means that He is able to return this man that is created from fluid gushed forth. In other words, He is able to repeat his creation and resurrect him to the final abode. This is clearly possible, because whoever is able to begin the creation then he surely is able to repeat it. Indeed Allah has mentioned this proof in more than one place in the Qur'an. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>On the Day of Judgement, Man will have no Power or Assistance</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  In this regard Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊõÈúáóì ÇáÓøóÑóÂÆöÑõ </div><br>  (The Day when all the secrets will be examined.) meaning, on the Day of Judgement the secrets will be tested. This means that they will be exposed and made manifest. Thus, the secret will be made open and that which is concealed will be well known. It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs on the authority of Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÑúİóÚõ áößõáøö ÛóÇÏöÑò áöæóÇÁñ ÚöäúÏó ÇÓúÊöåö íõŞóÇáõ: åĞöåö ÛóÏúÑóÉõ İõáóÇäö Èúäö İõáóÇä»</div><br>  (Every betrayer will have a flag raised for him behind his back, and it will be said, `This is the betrayal of so-and-so, the son of so-and-so.') Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ áóåõ</div><br>  (Then he will have no) meaning, man on the Day of Judgement.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ŞõæøóÉò</div><br>  (any power) meaning, within himself.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó äóÇÕöÑò</div><br>  (nor any helper.) meaning, from other than himself. This statement means that he will not be able to save himself from the torment of Allah, and nor will anyone else be able to save him.  </div></body></html>
