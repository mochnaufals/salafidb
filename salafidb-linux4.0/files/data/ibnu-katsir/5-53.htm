Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Umar ordered Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari to send him on one sheet of balance the count of what he took in and what he spent. Abu Musa then had a Christian scribe, and he was able to comply with `Umar's demand. `Umar liked what he saw and exclaimed, "This scribe is proficient. Would you read in the Masjid a letter that came to us from Ash-Sham'' Abu Musa said, `He cannot.'' `Umar said, "Is he not pure'' Abu Musa said, "No, but he is Christian.'' Abu Musa said, "So `Umar admonished me and poked my thigh (with his finger), saying, `Drive him out (from Al-Madinah).' He then recited,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóÊøóÎöĞõæÇú ÇáúíóåõæÏó æóÇáäøóÕóÜÑóì ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó</div><br>  (O you who believe!

They thus offer this excuse for their friendship and allegiances to the disbelievers, saying that they fear that the disbelievers might defeat the Muslims, so they want to be in favor with the Jews and Christians, to use this favor for their benefit in that eventuality! Allah replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÚóÓóì Çááøóåõ Ãóä íóÃúÊöìó ÈöÇáúİóÊúÍö</div><br>  (Perhaps Allah may bring a victory...) referring to the conquering of Makkah, according to As-Suddi.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÃóãúÑò ãøöäú ÚöäÏöåö</div><br>  (or a decision according to His will) requiring the Jews and Christians to pay the Jizyah, as As-Suddi stated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíõÕúÈöÍõæÇú</div><br>  (Then they will become) meaning, the hypocrites who gave their friendship to the Jews and Christians, will become,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóì ãóÂ ÃóÓóÑøõæÇú İöì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú</div><br>  (for what they have been keeping as a secret in themselves) of allegiances,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÜÏöãöíäó</div><br>  (regretful,) for their friendship with the Jews and Christians which did not benefit them or protect them from any harm. Rather, it was nothing but harm, as Allah exposed their true reality to His faithful servants in this life, although they tried to conceal it. When the signs that exposed their hypocrisy were compiled against them, their matter became clear to Allah's faithful servants. So the believers were amazed at these hypocrites who pretended to be believers, swearing to their faithfulness, yet their claims were all lies and deceit.
