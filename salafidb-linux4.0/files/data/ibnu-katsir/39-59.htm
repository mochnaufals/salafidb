This Ayah tells us that Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will forgive all the sins of those who repent to Him and turn back to Him, no matter what or how many his sins are, even if they are like the foam of the sea. This cannot be interpreted as meaning that sins will be forgiven without repentance, because Shirk can only be forgiven for the one who repents from it. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said that some of the people of Shirk killed many people and committed Zina (illegal sexual acts) to a great extent; they came to Muhammad and said, "What you are saying and calling us to is good; if only you could tell us that there is an expiation for what we have done.'' Then the following Ayat were revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÏúÚõæäó ãóÚó Çááøóåö ÅöáóÜåóÇ ÁóÇÎóÑó æóáÇó íóŞúÊõáõæäó ÇáäøóİúÓó ÇáøóÊöì ÍóÑøóãó Çááøóåõ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö æóáÇó íóÒúäõæäó</div><br>  (And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse) (25:68).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íÚöÈóÇÏöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÓúÑóİõæÇú Úóáóì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú áÇó ÊóŞúäóØõæÇú ãöä ÑøóÍúãóÉö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Say: "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the mercy of Allah.) This was also recorded by Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. What is meant by the first Ayah (25:68) is:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóä ÊóÇÈó æóÁóÇãóäó æóÚóãöáó ÚóãóáÇğ ÕóÜáöÍÇğ</div><br>  (Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds) (25:70). Imam Ahmad recorded that Asma' bint Yazid, said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah reciting,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ Úóãóáñ ÛóíúÑõ ÕóÜáöÍò</div><br>  (verily, his work is unrighteous) (11:46). And I heard him say: (Şõáú íóÇÚöÈóÇÏöí ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÓúÑóİõæÇ Úóáóì ÃóäúİõÓöåöãú áóÇ ÊóŞúäóØõæÇ ãöäú ÑóÍúãóÉö Çááåö Åöäøó Çááåó íóÛúİöÑõ ÇáĞøõäõæÈó ÌóãöíÚğÇ æóáóÇ íõÈóÇáöí Åöäøóåõ åõæó ÇáúÛóİõæÑõ ÇáÑøóÍöíãõ) (Say: "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins He does not reckon him Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful).'' This was also recorded by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi. All of these Hadiths indicate that what is meant is that Allah forgives all sins provided that a person repents. Additionally, one must not despair of the mercy of Allah even if his sins are many and great, for the door of repentance and mercy is expansive. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú íóÚúáóãõæÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó åõæó íóŞúÈóáõ ÇáÊøóæúÈóÉó Úóäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö</div><br>  (Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants) (9:104).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÚúãóáú ÓõæÁÇğ Ãóæú íóÙúáöãú äóİúÓóåõ Ëõãøó íóÓúÊóÛúİöÑö Çááøóåó íóÌöÏö Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑÇğ ÑøóÍöíãÇğ </div><br>  (And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) (4:110). Concerning the hypocrites, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó İöì ÇáÏøóÑúßö ÇáÇøñÓúİóáö ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö æóáóä ÊóÌöÏó áóåõãú äóÕöíÑÇğ ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóÇÈõæÇú æóÃóÕúáóÍõæÇú</div><br>  (Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them. Except those who repent, and do righteous good deeds) (4:145-146). And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóŞóÏú ßóİóÑó ÇáøóĞöíäó ŞóÇáõæÇú Åöäøó Çááøóåó ËóÜáöËõ ËóáóÜËóÉò æóãóÇ ãöäú ÅöáóÜåò ÅöáÇøó ÅöáóÜåñ æóÍöÏñ æóÅöä áøóãú íóäÊóåõæÇú ÚóãøóÇ íóŞõæáõæäó áóíóãóÓøóäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ãöäúåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ </div><br>  (Surely, disbelievers are those who said: "Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).'' But there is no god but One. And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them.) (5:73). Then He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó íóÊõæÈõæäó Åöáóì Çááøóåö æóíóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõæäóåõ æóÇááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (Will they not turn in repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) (5:74) And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó İóÊóäõæÇú ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó æóÇáúãõÄúãöäóÜÊö Ëõãøó áóãú íóÊõæÈõæÇú</div><br>  (Verily, those who put into trial the believing men and believing women (by torturing them), and then do not turn in repentance (to Allah)) (85: 10). Al-Hasan Al-Basri, may Allah have mercy on him, said, "Look at this generosity and kindness! They killed His close friends but He still called them to repentance and forgiveness.'' There are many Ayat on this topic. The Two Sahihs record the Hadith of Abu Sa`id, may Allah be pleased with him, from Messenger of Allah about the man who killed ninety-nine people. Later on, he regretted it and asked a worshipper among the Children of Israel whether he could repent. He told him no, so he killed him, thus completing one hundred. Then he asked one of their scholars whether he could repent. He said, "What is stopping you from repenting'' Then he told him to go to a town where Allah was worshipped. He set out for that town, but death came to him while he was on the road. The angels of mercy and the angels of punishment disputed over him, so Allah commanded them to measure the distance between the two towns; whichever he was closer to was the one to which he belonged. They found that he was closer to the town he was heading for, so the angels of mercy took him. It was said that when he was dying, he moved himself (towards that town), and Allah commanded the good town to move closer to him and the other town to move away. This is basic meaning of the Hadith; we have quoted it in full elsewhere. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íÚöÈóÇÏöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÓúÑóİõæÇú Úóáóì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú áÇó ÊóŞúäóØõæÇú ãöä ÑøóÍúãóÉö Çááøóåö Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóÛúİöÑõ ÇáĞøõäõæÈó ÌóãöíÚÇğ</div><br>  (Say: "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins...'') sAllah invites all to His forgiveness; those who claim that the Messiah is God, those who claim that the Messiah is the son of God, those who claim that `Uzayr is the son of God, those who claim that Allah is poor, those who claim that the Hand of Allah is tied up, and those who say that Allah is the third of three Trinity. Allah says to all of these:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó íóÊõæÈõæäó Åöáóì Çááøóåö æóíóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõæäóåõ æóÇááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (Will they not turn in repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) (5:74). And He calls to repentance the one who says something even worse than that, the one who says, `I am your Lord most high,' and says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ÚóáöãúÊõ áóßõãú ãøöäú ÅöáóÜåò ÛóíúÑöì</div><br>  ("I know not that you have a god other than me.'') (28:38). Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Anyone who makes the servants of Allah despair of His mercy after this, has rejected the Book of Allah, but a person cannot repent until Allah decrees that he should repent.''  At-Tabarani recorded that Shutayr bin Shakal said, "I heard Ibn Mas`ud say, `The greatest Ayah in the Book of Allah is:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó ÇáúÍóìøõ ÇáúŞóíøõæãõ </div><br>  (Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)(2:255). The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur'an concerning good and evil is:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóÃúãõÑõ ÈöÇáúÚóÏúáö æóÇáÅúÍúÓóÇäö</div><br>  (Verily, Allah enjoins justice and Al-Ihsan) (16:90). The Ayah in the Qur'an which brings the most relief is in Surat Az-Zumar:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íÚöÈóÇÏöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÓúÑóİõæÇú Úóáóì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú áÇó ÊóŞúäóØõæÇú ãöä ÑøóÍúãóÉö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Say: "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the mercy of Allah.'') And the clearest Ayah in the Qur'an about reliance on Allah is:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÊøóŞö Çááøóåó íóÌúÚóá áøóåõ ãóÎúÑóÌÇğæóíóÑúÒõŞúåõ ãöäú ÍóíúËõ áÇó íóÍúÊóÓöÈõ</div><br>  (And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine) (65:2-3).' Masruq said to him; `You have spoken the truth.''' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Hadiths which tell us not to despair</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah , say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö áóæú ÃóÎúØóÃúÊõãú ÍóÊúì ÊóãúáóÃó ÎóØóÇíóÇßõãú ãóÇ Èóíúäó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ Ëõãøó ÇÓúÊóÛúİóÑúÊõãõ Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì áóÛóİóÑó áóßõãú¡ æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓõ ãõÍóãøóÏòÈöíóÏöåö áóæú áóãú ÊõÎúØöÆõæÇ áóÌóÇÁó Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó ÈöŞóæúãò íõÎúØöÆõæäó¡ Ëõãøó íóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõæäó Çááåó İóíóÛúİöÑõ áóåõã»</div><br>  (By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if you were to commit sin until your sins filled the space between heaven and earth, then you were to ask Allah for forgiveness, He would forgive you. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, if you did not commit sin, Allah would bring other people who would commit sins and then ask Allah for forgiveness so that He could forgive them.)''  This was recorded only by Ahmad. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, as he was on his deathbed, "I have concealed something from you that I heard from the Messenger of Allah ; he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæúáóÇ Ãóäøóßõãú ÊõĞúäöÈõæäó áóÎóáóŞó Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó ŞóæúãğÇ íõĞúäöÈõæäó¡ İóíóÛúİöÑõ áóåõã»</div><br>  (If you did not commit sins, Allah would create people who would sin so that He could forgive them.)''
