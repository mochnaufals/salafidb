Hence, every nation and tribe has its own Qiblah that they choose, while Allah's appointed Qiblah is what the believers face.''  Abul-`Aliyah said, "The Jew has a direction to which he faces (in the prayer). The Christian has a direction to which he faces. Allah has guided you, O (Muslim) Ummah, to a Qiblah which is the true Qiblah.'' This statement was also related to Mujahid, `Ata' Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi, and others.  This last Ayah is similar to what Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áößõáøò ÌóÚóáúäóÇ ãöäßõãú ÔöÑúÚóÉğ æóãöäúåóÜÌÇğ æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ áóÌóÚóáóßõãú ÃõãøóÉğ æóÍöÏóÉğ æóáóÜßöä áøöíóÈúáõæóßõãú İöì ãóÂ ÁóÇÊóÜßõã İóÇÓúÊóÈöŞõæÇ ÇáÎóíúÑóÇÊö Åöáóì Çááå ãóÑúÌöÚõßõãú ÌóãöíÚÇğ</div><br>  (To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way.
