This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÏúÚõ ãóÚó Çááøóåö ÅöáóÜåóÇ ÁóÇÎóÑó áÇó ÈõÑúåóÇäó áóåõ Èöåö İóÅöäøóãóÇ ÍöÓóÇÈõåõ ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåö Åöäøóåõ áÇó íõİúáöÍõ ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó </div><br>  (And whoever calls upon, besides Allah, any other god, of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, the disbelievers will not be successful.) 23:117 So Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ áóãú íõäóÒøöáú Èöåö ÓõáúØóÜäÇğ æóãóÇ áóíúÓó áóåõãú Èöåö Úöáúãñ</div><br>  (for which He has sent down no authority, and of which they have no knowledge;) meaning, they have no knowledge in the subject that they fabricate lies about; it is only something which was handed down to them from their fathers and ancestors, with no evidence or proof, and its origins lie in that which the Shaytan beautified for them and made attractive to them. Allah warned them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ áöáÙøóÜáöãöíäó ãöä äøóÕöíÑò</div><br>  (and for the wrongdoers there is no helper.) meaning, no one to help them against Allah when He sends His punishment and torment upon them.
