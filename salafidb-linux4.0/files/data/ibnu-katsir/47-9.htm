So, when you meet those who disbelieve (in battle), smite (their) necks until you have fully defeated them, then tighten their bonds. Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity or ransom, until the war lays down its burden.

But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.) (5. He will guide them and amend their condition.) (6. And admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them.) (7. O you who believe! If you support (in the cause of) Allah, He will support you, and make your foothold firm.) (8.

Later on, after the war ends and the conflict has ceased, you have a choice in regard to the captives: You may either act graciously toward them by setting them free without charge, or free them for a ransom that you require from them.' It appears that this Ayah was revealed after the battle of Badr. At that time, Allah reproached the believers for sparing many of the enemy's soldiers, and holding too many captives in order to take ransom from them. So He said then:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ßóÇäó áöäóÈöìøò Ãóä íóßõæäó áóåõ ÃóÓúÑóì ÍóÊøóì íõËúÎöäó İöí ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÊõÑöíÏõæäó ÚóÑóÖó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÇááøóåõ íõÑöíÏõ ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉó æóÇááøóåõ ÚóÒöíÒñ Íóßöíãñ - áøóæúáÇó ßöÊóÜÈñ ãøöäó Çááøóåö ÓóÈóŞó áóãóÓøóßõãú İöíãóÂ ÃóÎóĞúÊõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ ÚóÙöíãñ </div><br>  (It is not for a Prophet to have captives of war until he had made a great slaughter (among the enemies) in the land. You desire the commodities of this world, but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. Allah is Mighty and Wise. Were it not for a prior decree from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.)

Mujahid said: "Until `Isa bin Maryam (peace be upon him) descends.''

Imam Ahmad recorded from Jubayr bin Nufayr who reported from Salamah bin Nufayl that he went to the Messenger of Allah and said, "I have let my horse go, and thrown down my weapon, for the war has ended. There is no more fighting.'' Then the Prophet said to him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÇäó ÌóÇÁó ÇáúŞöÊóÇáõ¡ áóÇ ÊóÒóÇáõ ØóÇÆöİóÉñ ãöäú ÃõãøóÊöí ÙóÇåöÑöíäó Úóáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö¡ íõÒöíÛõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì ŞõáõæÈó ÃóŞúæóÇã¡ İóíõŞóÇÊöáõæäóåõãú æóíóÑúÒõŞõåõãõ Çááåõ ãöäúåõãú ÍóÊúì íóÃúÊöíó ÃóãúÑõ Çááåö æóåõãú Úóáóì Ğáößó¡ ÃóáóÇ Åöäøó ÚõŞúÑó ÏóÇÑö ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÇáÔøóÇãõ¡ æóÇáúÎóíúáõ ãóÚúŞõæÏñ İöí äóæóÇÕöíåóÇ ÇáúÎóíúÑõ Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (Now the time of fighting has come.

Allah will turn the hearts of some people away (from the truth), so they (that group) will fight against them, and Allah will bestow on them (war spoils) from them (the enemies) -- until Allah's command comes to pass while they are in that state. Verily, the center of the believers' abode is Ash-Sham. And goodness is tied around the horses' foreheads till the Day of Resurrection.) An-Nasa'i also recorded this narration. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó æóáóæú íóÔóÂÁõ Çááøóåõ áÇóäúÊóÕóÑó ãöäúåõãú</div><br>  (Thus, and had Allah so willed, He could have taken vengeance against them;) which means that had He so willed, He could have taken immediate vengeance against the disbelievers with a chastisement or exemplary punishment directly from Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöä áøöíóÈúáõæó ÈóÚúÖóßõãú ÈöÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (but (He lets you struggle) so as to test with one another.) meaning, He has ordered Jihad and fighting against the enemies in order to try you and test your affairs. Allah also expresses His wisdom by the legislation of Jihad in the following two Surahs, Al `Iman and At-Tawbah, in which He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÍóÓöÈúÊõãú Ãóä ÊóÏúÎõáõæÇú ÇáúÌóäøóÉó æóáóãøóÇ íóÚúáóãö Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÌóÜåóÏõæÇú ãöäßõãú æóíóÚúáóãó ÇáÕøóÜÈöÑöíäó </div><br>  (Or did you think that you would enter the Paradise before Allah had made evident those of you who fight in His cause and made evident those who are steadfast) (3:142)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÜÊöáõæåõãú íõÚóĞøöÈúåõãõ Çááøóåõ ÈöÃóíúÏöíßõãú æóíõÎúÒöåöãú æóíóäúÕõÑúßõãú Úóáóíúåöãú æóíóÔúİö ÕõÏõæÑó Şóæúãò ãøõÄúãöäöíäó - æóíõĞúåöÈú ÛóíúÙó ŞõáõæÈöåöãú æóíóÊõæÈõ Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ æóÇááøóåõ Úóáöíãñ Íóßöíãñ </div><br>  (Fight them; Allah will then punish them by your hands, disgrace them, grant you victory over them, satisfy the breasts of a believing people, and remove the fury of their (the believers') hearts. Allah turns in forgiveness to whom He wills; Allah is Knowing and Wise.) ( 9:14-15) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Merit of the Martyrs</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Since it is customary during wars that many of the believers die, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ŞõÊöáõæÇú İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö İóáóä íõÖöáøó ÃóÚúãóÜáóåõãú</div><br>  (But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.) which means that He would not let their good deeds go to waste, but would rather multiply and increase them. Some of them will continue being rewarded for their good deeds for the entire length of their stay in Al-Barzakh. This has been mentioned in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad on the authority of Kathir bin Murrah, who reported from Qays Al-Judhami, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÚúØóì ÇáÔøóåöíÏõ ÓöÊøó ÎöÕóÇáò ÚöäúÏó Ãóæøóáö ŞóØúÑóÉò ãöäú Ïóãöåö: ÊõßóİøóÑõ Úóäúåõ ßõáøõ ÎóØöíÆóÉò¡ æóíóÑóì ãóŞúÚóÏóåõ ãöäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóíõÒóæøóÌõ ãöäó ÇáúÍõæÑö ÇáúÚöíä¡ æóíóÃúãóäõ ãöäó ÇáúİóÒóÚö ÇáúÃóßúÈóÑö¡ æóãöäú ÚóĞóÇÈö ÇáúŞóÈúÑö¡ æóíõÍóáøóì ÍõáøóÉó ÇáúÅöíãóÇä»</div><br>  (As the first drop of his blood gushes forth, a martyr is granted six merits: all of his sins are forgiven, he is shown his place in Paradise, he is married to wide-eyed Huris, he is secured from the great fear (on Judgement Day) and the torment of the grave, and he is adorned with the adornments of Iman.) Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith. Abu Ad-Darda', may Allah be pleased with him, reported that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÔóİøóÚõ ÇáÔøóåöíÏõ İöí ÓóÈúÚöíäó ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÈóíúÊöå»</div><br>  (A martyr is allowed to intercede for seventy members of his household. ) This was recorded by Abu Dawud, and there are numerous other Hadiths mentioning the merits of the martyrs. As for Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóíóåúÏöíåöãú</div><br>  (He will guide them) meaning, He will guide them to Jannah. This is similar to Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÇÊö íóåúÏöíåöãú ÑóÈøõåõãú ÈöÅöíãóÇäöåöãú ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåöãõ ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ İöí ÌóäøóÜÊö ÇáäøóÚöíãö </div><br>  (Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous good deeds, their Lord will guide them because of their Faith: beneath them rivers will flow in the Gardens of Pleasure.) (10:9) Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÕúáöÍõ ÈóÇáóåõãú</div><br>  (and amend their condition.) meaning, their situation and affairs.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÏúÎöáõåõãõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ÚóÑøóİóåóÇ áóåõãú </div><br>  (And (He will) admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them.) It means that He has acquainted them with Paradise and guided them to it. Mujahid said: "The people of Paradise will be guided to their houses and dwellings and whatever sections Allah has ordained for them in it. They will not make mistakes in this, nor will they ask anyone for directions to their dwellings -- as if they had dwelt in it from the time they were first created.'' Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÎóáóÕó ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö ÍõÈöÓõæÇ ÈöŞóäúØóÑóÉò Èóíúäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóÇáäøóÇÑö¡ íóÊóŞóÇÕøõæäó ãóÙóÇáöãó ßóÇäóÊú Èóíúäóåõãú İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ ÍóÊúì ÅĞóÇ åõĞøöÈõæÇ æóäõŞøõæÇ ÃõĞöäó áóåõãú İöí ÏõÎõæáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö Åöäøó ÃóÍóÏóåõãú ÈöãóäúÒöáöåö İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÃóåúÏóì ãöäúåõ ÈöãóäúÒöáöåö ÇáøóĞöí ßóÇäó İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ»</div><br>  (After the believers securely pass the Fire (on the Day of Judgement), they will be held back upon a bridge between Paradise and the Fire. There, they will have any acts of injustice that they committed against one another in the life of this world rectified. After they are completely purified and cleansed (from injustice), they will be admitted into Paradise. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, each one of them will find his way to his dwelling in Paradise better than he found his way to his dwelling in the worldly life.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Support Allah's Cause, He will then support You</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú Åöä ÊóäÕõÑõæÇú Çááøóåó íóäÕõÑúßõãú æóíõËóÈøöÊú ÃóŞúÏóÇãóßõãú </div><br>  (O you who believe!

(22:40) That is because the reward is comparable to the type of deed that is performed. Thus, Allah says here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõËóÈøöÊú ÃóŞúÏóÇãóßõãú</div><br>  (and make your foothold firm.) Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú İóÊóÚúÓÇğ áøóåõãú</div><br>  (But as for those who disbelieve -- misery awaits them) This misery is the opposite of making firm the footholds of the believers who support the cause of Allah and His Messenger .
