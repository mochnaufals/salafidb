Also, what they said they would do, would never have been fulfilled by them, and this is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöä ŞõæÊöáõæÇú áÇó íóäÕõÑõæäóåõãú</div><br>  (and if they are attacked, they will never help them.) meaning, the hypocrites will not fight along with the Jews,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöä äøóÕóÑõæåõãú</div><br>  (And (even) if they do help them, ) and even if the hypocrites did fight along their side,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíõæóáøõäøó ÇáÇøñÏúÈóÜÑó Ëõãøó áÇó íõäÕóÑõæäó</div><br>  (they will turn their backs, and they will not be victorious.)

They only fight when they have to defend themselves (even though they threaten Muslims of reprisals). Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóÃúÓõåõãú Èóíúäóåõãú ÔóÏöíÏñ</div><br>  (Their enmity among themselves is very great.) meaning, the enmity they feel against each other is intense,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõĞöíŞó ÈóÚúÖóßõãú ÈóÃúÓó ÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (And make you to taste the violence of one another.)(6:65) Allah said in the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÍúÓóÈõåõãú ÌóãöíÚÇğ æóŞõáõæÈõåõãú ÔóÊøóì</div><br>  (You would think they were united, but their hearts are divided.) meaning, even though one might see them combining forces and think that these forces are harmonious, yet in reality, they are divided severely. Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said that this Ayah refers to the hypocrites and the People of the Scriptures,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú Şóæúãñ áÇøó íóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (That is because they are a people who understand not.)

But when (man) disbelieves, Shaytan says: "I am free of you...'') meaning, the example of the Jews being deceived by the promises of the hypocrites, who said that they will help them if Muslims fight them, is that of the devil. When matters got serious and the Jews were besieged, the hypocrites betrayed them and abandoned them to taste utter defeat. Likewise, the devil lures mankind into disbelief and when they obey him, he disowns them and declares himself free of their actions, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì ÃóÎóÇİõ Çááøóåó ÑóÈøó ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (I fear Allah, the Lord of all that exists!)
