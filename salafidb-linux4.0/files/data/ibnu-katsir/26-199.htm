Allah took a covenant from them that they would follow it, and the last of them stood and addressed his people with the good news of Ahmad:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ŞóÇáó ÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäõ ãóÑúíóãó íÈóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó Åöäøöì ÑóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö Åöáóíúßõã ãøõÕóÏøöŞÇğ áøöãóÇ Èóíúäó íóÏóìøó ãöäó ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉö æóãõÈóÔøöÑÇğ ÈöÑóÓõæáò íóÃúÊöì ãöä ÈóÚúÏöì ÇÓúãõåõ ÃóÍúãóÏõ</div><br>  (And (remember) when `Isa, son of Maryam, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawrah before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.) (61:6) Zubur here refers to Books; Zubur is the plural of Az-Zabur, which is also the name used to refer to the Book given to Dawud. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõáøõ ÔóìúÁò İóÚóáõæåõ İöì ÇáÒøõÈõÑö </div><br>  (And everything they have done is noted in the Az-Zubur.) (54:52), meaning, it is recorded against them in the books of the angels.

Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÊøóÈöÚõæäó ÇáÑøóÓõæáó ÇáäøóÈöìøó ÇáÃõãøöìøó</div><br>  (Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write ...)

If this Book with all its eloquence had been revealed to a non-Arab who did not know one word of Arabic, they still would not have believed in him.
