And those who have no knowledge say: "Why does not Allah speak to us (face to face) or why does not a sign come to us'' So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike, We have indeed made plain the signs for people who believe with certainty.)</div>  Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said that Rafi` bin Huraymilah said to the Messenger of Allah , "O Muhammad! If you were truly a Messenger from Allah, as you claim, then ask Allah to speak to us directly, so that we hear His Speech.'' So Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó áóæúáÇó íõßóáøöãõäóÇ Çááøóåõ Ãóæú ÊóÃúÊöíäóÂ ÁóÇíóÉñ</div><br>  (And those who have no knowledge say: "Why does not Allah speak to us (face to face) or why does not a sign come to us'')  Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Qatadah and As-Suddi said that it was actually the statement of the Arab disbelievers:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó ŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó ãöä ŞóÈúáöåöã ãøöËúáó Şóæúáöåöãú</div><br>  (So said the people before them words of similar import. ) He said, "These are the Jews and the Christians.''  What further proves that the Arab idolators said the statement mentioned in the Ayah is that Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ÁóÇíóÉñ ŞóÇáõæÇú áóä äøõÄúãöäó ÍóÊøóì äõÄúÊóì ãöËúáó ãóÂ ÃõæÊöìó ÑõÓõáõ Çááøóåö Çááøóåõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÍóíúËõ íóÌúÚóáõ ÑöÓóÇáóÊóåõ ÓóíõÕöíÈõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÌúÑóãõæÇú ÕóÛóÇÑñ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö æóÚóĞóÇÈñ ÔóÏöíÏñ ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóãúßõÑõæäó </div><br>  (And when there comes to them a sign (from Allah) they say: "We shall not believe until we receive the like of that which the Messengers of Allah had received.''

There are many other Ayat that testify to the disbelief of the Arab idolators, their transgression, stubbornness, and that they asked unnecessary questions out of disbelief and arrogance. The statements of the Arab idolators followed the statements of the nations of the People of the Two Scriptures and other religions before them. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÃóáõßó Ãóåúáõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö Ãóä ÊõäóÒøöáó Úóáóíúåöãú ßöÊóÜÈÇğ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö İóŞóÏú ÓóÃóáõæÇú ãõæÓóì ÃóßúÈóÑó ãöä Ğáößó İóŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóÑöäóÇ Çááøóåö ÌóåúÑóÉğ</div><br>  (The People of the Scripture (Jews) ask you to cause a book to descend upon them from heaven. Indeed, they asked Musa (Moses) for even greater than that, when they said: "Show us Allah in public,'') (4:153) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ŞõáúÊõãú íóÜãõæÓóì áóä äøõÄúãöäó áóßó ÍóÊøóì äóÑóì Çááøóåó ÌóåúÑóÉğ</div><br>  (And (remember) when you said: "O Musa!

Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÔóÜÈóåóÊú ŞõáõæÈõåõãú</div><br>  (Their hearts are alike. ) means, the hearts of the Arab idolators are just like the hearts of those before them, containing disbelief, stubbornness and injustice. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó ãóÂ ÃóÊóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ãöä ŞóÈúáöåöãú ãøöä ÑøóÓõæáò ÅöáÇøó ŞóÇáõæÇú ÓóÜÍöÑñ Ãóæú ãóÌúäõæäñ ÃóÊóæóÇÕóæúÇú Èöåö</div><br>  (Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: "A sorcerer or a madman!'' Have they (the people of the past) transmitted this saying to these (Quraysh pagans)) (51:52-53).  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÈóíøóäøóÇ ÇáÂíóÜÊö áöŞóæúãò íõæŞöäõæäó</div><br>  (We have indeed made plain the signs for people who believe with certainty.) meaning, We made the arguments clear, prooving the truth of the Messengers, with no need of more questions or proofs for those who believe, follow the Messengers and comprehend what Allah sent them with. As for those whose hearts and hearing Allah has stamped and whose eyes have been sealed, Allah described them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÍóŞøóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó - æóáóæú ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ßõáøõ ÁÇíóÉò ÍóÊøóì íóÑóæõÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáÇøñáöíãó </div><br>  (Truly, those, against whom the Word (wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment) (10:96-97).  </div></body></html>
