The blessings include the benefits derived from their wool and hair, from which clothes and furnishings are made, from their milk which is drunk, and their young which are eaten. Their beauty is a kind of adornment, thus Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóßõãú İöíåóÇ ÌóãóÇáñ Íöíäó ÊõÑöíÍõæäó</div><br>  (And there is beauty in them for you, when you bring them home in the evening.) which is when they are brought back from the pasture in the evening. This is a reference to how their flanks become fat, their udders fill with milk and their humps become bigger.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍöíäó ÊóÓúÑóÍõæäó</div><br>  (and as you lead them forth to pasture (in the morning).) meaning when you send them out to the pasture in the morning.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÍúãöáõ ÃóËúŞóÇáóßõãú</div><br>  (And they carry your loads) meaning the heavy burdens that you cannot move or carry by yourselves   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì ÈóáóÏò áøóãú ÊóßõæäõæÇú ÈóÜáöÛöíåö ÅöáÇøó ÈöÔöŞøö ÇáÃóäİõÓö</div><br>  (to a land that you could not reach except with great trouble to yourselves) meaning journeys for Hajj, `Umrah, military campaigns, and journeys for the purpose of trading, and so on. They use these animals for all kinds of purposes, for riding and for carrying loads, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó áóßõãú İöì ÇáÇøñäúÚóÜãö áóÚöÈúÑóÉğ äøõÓúŞöíßõãú ãøöãøóÇ İöì ÈõØõæäöåóÇ æóáóßõãú İíöåóÇ ãóäóÜİöÚõ ßóËöíÑóÉñ æóãöäúåóÇ ÊóÃúßõáõæäó - æóÚóáóíúåóÇ æóÚóáóì Çáúİõáúßö ÊõÍúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (And verily, there is indeed a lesson for you in the An'am (cattle).
