Depart you to a shadow in three columns,) meaning, a flame of fire when it rises and ascends with smoke. So due to its severity and strength, it will have three columns.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó Ùóáöíáò æóáÇó íõÛúäöì ãöäó ÇááøóåóÈö </div><br>  (Neither shady nor of any use against the fierce flame of the Fire.) meaning, shade of the smoke that comes from the flame -- which itself will not have a shade, nor will it benefit against the flame. This means it will not protect them from the heat of the flame. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóåóÇ ÊóÑúãöì ÈöÔóÑóÑò ßóÇáúŞóÕúÑö </div><br>  (Verily, it throws sparks as Al-Qasr,) meaning, its sparks will shoot out from its flame like huge castles. Ibn Mas`ud said, "Like forts.'' Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Malik who reported from Zayd bin Aslam and others said, "This means the trunk of trees.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÃóäøóåõ ÌöãóÜáóÉñ ÕõİúÑñ </div><br>  (As if they were Sufr camels.) means, black camels. This is the view of Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, and Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Jarir favored this view. Ibn `Abbas Mujahid, and Sa`id bin Jubayr said about,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌöãóÜáóÉñ ÕõİúÑñ</div><br>  (Sufr camels.) "Meaning ropes of ships.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóåóÇ ÊóÑúãöì ÈöÔóÑóÑò ßóÇáúŞóÕúÑö </div><br>  (Verily, it (Hell) throws sparks as Al-Qasr.)

Rather, the proof will be established against them, and they will be called upon to speak about the wrong that they did, but they will not be able to say anything. The courts of the Day of Judgement will occur in stages. Sometimes the Lord informs of this stage and sometimes He informs of that stage. This is to show the terrors and calamities of that Day. Thus, after all the details of this discussion, He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíúáñ íóæúãóÆöĞò áøöáúãõßóĞøöÈöíäó </div><br>  (Woe that Day to the deniers!)

It means, `if you are able to save yourselves from being seized by Me, and rescue yourselves from My ruling, then do so. But you are certainly not able to do so.'

(55:33) Allah also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÖõÑøõæäóåõ ÔóíúÆğÇ</div><br>  (And you will not harm Him in the least.)
