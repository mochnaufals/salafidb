This is why he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÃúÊöíßõãóÇ ØóÚóÇãñ ÊõÑúÒóŞóÇäöåö ÅöáÇøó äóÈøóÃúÊõßõãóÇ ÈöÊóÃúæöíáöåö</div><br>  (No food will come to you as your provision, but I will inform you of its interpretation)  Mujahid commented,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÃúÊöíßõãóÇ ØóÚóÇãñ ÊõÑúÒóŞóÇäöåö</div><br>  (No food will come to you as your provision,) this day,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó äóÈøóÃúÊõßõãóÇ ÈöÊóÃúæöíáöåö ŞóÈúáó Ãóä íóÃúÊöíóßõãóÇ</div><br>  (but I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes.) As-Suddi said similarly. Yusuf said that, this knowledge is from Allah Who taught it to me, because I shunned the religion of those who disbelieve in Him and the Last Day, who neither hope for Allah's reward nor fear His punishment on the Day of Return,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóÈóÚúÊõ ãöáøóÉó ÁóÇÈóÂÁöí ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóíóÚúŞõæÈó</div><br>  (And I have followed the religion of my fathers, - Ibrahim, Ishaq and Ya`qub) Yusuf said, `I have avoided the way of disbelief and polytheism, and followed the way of these honorable Messengers,' may Allah's peace and blessings be on them. This, indeed, is the way of he who seeks the path of guidance and follows the way of the Messengers, all the while shunning the path of deviation. It is he whose heart Allah will guide, teaching him what he did not know beforehand. It is he whom Allah will make an Imam who is imitated in the way of righteousness, and a caller to the path of goodness.
