Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöíõĞöíŞóßõãú ãøöä ÑøóÍúãóÊöåö</div><br>  (giving you a taste of His mercy,) that is, the rain which will come down and revive people and the land.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöÊóÌúÑöìó Çáúİõáúßõ ÈöÃóãúÑöåö</div><br>  (and that the ships may sail at His command,) means, on the sea, for they are driven by the wind.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöÊóÈúÊóÛõæÇú ãöä İóÖúáöåö</div><br>  (and that you may seek of His bounty,) means, by trading, earning a living and traveling from one country to another, one region to another.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÔúßõÑõæäó</div><br>  (in order that you may be thankful.) means, that you may give thanks to Allah for the innumerable favors He has done for you, both visible and hidden. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ÑõÓõáÇğ Åöáóì Şóæúãöåöãú İóÌóÂÁõæåõã ÈöÇáúÈóíøöäóÇÊö İóÇäÊóŞóãúäóÇ ãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÌúÑóãõæÇú</div><br>  (And indeed We did send Messengers before you to their own peoples. They came to them with clear proofs, then, We took vengeance on those who committed crimes;) These are words of consolation from Allah to His servant and Messenger Muhammad . They tell him that if many of his people and of mankind disbelieve in him, the previous Messengers were also rejected, despite the clear signs that they brought, but Allah punished those who rejected and opposed them, and saved those who believed in them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÍóŞøÇğ ÚóáóíúäóÇ äóÕúÑõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäíäó</div><br>  (and it was incumbent upon Us to help the believers.) This is a duty which Allah took upon Himself as a blessing and a favor to them. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÊóÈó ÑóÈøõßõãú Úóáóì äóİúÓöåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÉó</div><br>  (your Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself) (6:54). Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Ad-Darda', may Allah be pleased with him, said: "I heard Allah's Messenger saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäö ÇãúÑöìÁò ãõÓúáöãò íóÑõÏøõ Úóäú ÚöÑúÖö ÃóÎöíåö ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇäó ÍóŞøğÇ Úóáóì Çááåö Ãóäú íóÑõÏøó Úóäúåõ äóÇÑó Ìóåóäøóãó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (No Muslim man defends the honor of his brother except that there would be a right upon Allah to defend him from the fire of Hell on the Day of Resurrection.)  Then he recited this Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÍóŞøÇğ ÚóáóíúäóÇ äóÕúÑõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäíäó</div><br>  (and it was incumbent upon Us to help the believers.)''  </div></body></html>
