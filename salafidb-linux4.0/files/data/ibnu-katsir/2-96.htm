The Jews declined this offer by the Messenger of Allah .''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóä íóÊóãóäøóæúåõ ÃóÈóÏğÇ ÈöãóÇ ŞóÏøóãóÊú ÃóíúÏöíåöãú æóÇááøóåõ Úóáöíãñ ÈöÇáÙøóÜáöãíäó </div><br>  (But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent before them (i.e. what they have done). And Allah is Aware of the Zalimin (polytheists and wrongdoers).) meaning, "Since they know that they recognize you, and yet disbelieve in you.'' Had they wished death that day, no Jew would have remained alive on the face of the earth. Moreover, Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóãóäøóæõÇú ÇáúãóæúÊó</div><br>  (Then long for death), means, "Invoke (Allah) for death.'' Also, `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that `Ikrimah said that Ibn `Abbas commented,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóãóäøóæõÇú ÇáúãóæúÊó</div><br>  (Then long for death if you are truthful), "Had the Jews invoked Allah for death, they would have perished.'' Also, Ibn Abi Hatim recorded Sa`id bin Jubayr saying that Ibn `Abbas said, "Had the Jews asked for death, one of them would have choked on his own saliva.'' These statements have authentic chains of narration up to Ibn `Abbas. Further, Ibn Jarir said in his Tafsir, "We were told that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú Ãóäøó ÇáúíóåõæÏó ÊóãóäøóæõÇ ÇáúãóæúÊó áóãóÇÊõæÇ æóáóÑóÃóæúÇ ãóŞóÇÚöÏóåõãú ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ æóáóæú ÎóÑóÌó ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÈóÇåöáõæäó ÑóÓõæáó ÇááåöÕáì Çááå Úáíå æÓáøã áóÑóÌóÚõæÇ áóÇ íóÌöÏõæäó ÃóåúáğÇ æóáóÇ ãóÇáğÇ»</div><br>  (Had the Jews wished for death, they would have died and seen their seats in the Fire. And, those who invoked such curse against Allah's Messenger would have found no families or property had they returned to their homes).''  Similar to this Ayah is Allah's statement in Surat Al-Jumu`ah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú Åöä ÒóÚãúÊõãú Ãóäøóßõãú ÃóæúáöíóÂÁõ áöáøóåö ãöä Ïõæäö ÇáäøóÇÓö İóÊóãóäøóæõÇú ÇáúãóæúÊó Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó - æóáÇó íóÊóãóäøóæäóåõ ÃóÈóÏÇğ ÈöãóÇ ŞóÏøóãóÊú ÃóíúÏíåöãú æóÇááøóåõ Úóáöíãñ ÈöÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó - Şõáú Åöäøó ÇáúãóæúÊó ÇáøóĞöì ÊóİöÑøõæäó ãöäúåõ İóÅöäøóåõ ãõáóÜŞöíßõãú Ëõãøó ÊõÑóÏøõæäó Åöáóì ÚóÇáöãö ÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÇáÔøóåóÜÏóÉö İóíõäóÈøöÆõßõã ÈöãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  ((Say (O Muhammad ): "O you Jews! If you pretend that you are friends of Allah, to the exclusion of (all) other mankind, then long for death if you are truthful. ''But they will never long for it (death), because of what (deeds) their hands have sent before them! And Allah knows well the Zalimin. Say (to them): "Verily, the death from which you flee will surely meet you, then you will be sent back to (Allah) the Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will tell you what you used to do.'') (62:6-8).  So they claimed that they are Allah's sons and loved ones and said, "Only those who are Christian or Jews shall enter Paradise.'' Therefore, they were called to invoke Allah to destroy the lying group, be it them or the Muslims. When the Jews declined, every one was sure of their wrong, for had they been sure of their claims, then they would have accepted the proposal. Their lies were thus exposed after they declined the offer to invoke the curse.  Similarly, the Messenger of Allah called a delegation of Najran's Christians to curse after he refuted them in a debate in which they demonstrated stubbornness and defiance. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóäú ÍóÂÌøóßó İöíåö ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌóÂÁóßó ãöäó ÇáúÚöáúãö İóŞõáú ÊóÚóÇáóæúÇú äóÏúÚõ ÃóÈúäóÂÁóäóÇ æóÃóÈúäóÂÁóßõãú æóäöÓóÂÁóäóÇ æóäöÓóÂÁóßõãú æóÃóäİõÓóäóÇ æÃóäİõÓóßõãú Ëõãøó äóÈúÊóåöáú İóäóÌúÚóá áøóÚúäóÊõ Çááøóåö Úóáóì ÇáúßóÜĞöÈöíäó </div><br>  (Then whoever disputes with you concerning him (`Isa) after (all this) knowledge that has come to you (i.e. `Isa) being a servant of Allah, and having no share in divinity), say (O Muhammad ): "Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves Ü then we pray and invoke (sincerely) the curse of Allah upon those who lie.'') (3:61).  When the Christians heard this challenge, some of them said to each other, "By Allah! If you do such with this Prophet, none of you will have an eye that blinks.'' This is when they resorted to peace and gave the Jizyah (tax) in disgrace. The Prophet accepted the Jizyah from them and sent Abu `Ubaydah bin Al-Jarrah with them as a trustee. Similar to this meaning is Allah's command to His Prophet to proclaim to the polytheists:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ãóä ßóÇäó İöì ÇáÖøóáóÜáóÉö İóáúíóãúÏõÏú áóåõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ ãóÏøÇğ</div><br>  (Say (O Muhammad ) whoever is in error, the Most Gracious (Allah) will prolong him (in it).) (19:75) meaning, "Whoever among us has deviated, may Allah increase and prolong his deviation.'' We will mention this subject later, Allah willing.  The Mubahalah (invocation to Allah to destroy the liars) was called a `wish' here, because every just person wishes that Allah destroy the unjust opponent who is debating with him, especially when the just person has a clear, apparent proof for the truth he is calling to. Also, the Mubahalah involves invoking Allah for death of the unjust group, because to disbelievers, life is the biggest prize, especially when they know the evil destination they will meet after death. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Disbelievers wish They could live longer</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  This is why Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóä íóÊóãóäøóæúåõ ÃóÈóÏğÇ ÈöãóÇ ŞóÏøóãóÊú ÃóíúÏöíåöãú æóÇááøóåõ Úóáöíãñ ÈöÇáÙøóÜáöãíäó æóáóÊóÌöÏóäøóåõãú ÃóÍúÑóÕó ÇáäøóÇÓö Úóáóì ÍóíóæÉò</div><br>  (But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent before them (i.e.what they have done). And Allah is Aware of the Zalimin. And verily, you will find them (the Jews) the greediest of mankind for life.) meaning, greedy to live longer, because they know their evil end, and the only reward they will have with Allah is total loss. This life is a prison for the believer and Paradise for the disbeliever. Therefore, the People of the Book wish they could delay the Hereafter, as much as possible. However, they shall certainly meet what they are trying to avoid, even if they are more eager to delay the Hereafter than the polytheists who do not have a divine book.  Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Ibn `Abbas commented on,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ åõæó ÈöãõÒóÍúÒöÍöåö ãöäó ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö Ãóä íõÚóãøóÑó</div><br>  (But the grant of such life will not save him even a little from (due) punishment.) "Long life shall not save them from torment. Certainly, the polytheists do not believe in resurrection after death, and they would love to enjoy a long life. The Jews know the humiliation they will suffer in the Hereafter for knowingly ignoring the truth.'' Also, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, "The Jews are most eager for this life. They wish they could live for a thousand years. However, living for a thousand years will not save them from torment, just as Iblis' - Satan - long life did not benefit him, due to being a disbeliever.'' t   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÈóÕöíÑñ ÈöãóÇ íóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (And Allah is Seer of what they do.) meaning, "Allah knows what His servants are doing, whether good or evil, and will compensate each of them accordingly.''  </div></body></html>
