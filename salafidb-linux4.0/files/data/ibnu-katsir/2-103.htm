These Ayat are contained in the Book of Allah (Qur'an) which narrates the secrets of the knowledge that the Jews possess, which they hid, and the stories of their earlier generations. The Book of Allah also mentions the texts in the Books of the Jews that are known to only the rabbis and scholars, and the sections where they altered and distorted the rulings of the Tawrah. Since Allah mentioned all of this in His Book revealed to His Prophet Muhammad , then this fact alone should be enough evidence for those who are truthful with themselves and who wish to avoid bringing themselves to destruction due to envy and transgression. Further human instict testifies to the truth that Muhammad was sent with and the clear signs that he brought which he did not learn or acquire from mankind. Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÃóäÒóáúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó ÁóÇíóÜÊò ÈóíøöäóÜÊò</div><br>  (And indeed We have sent down to you manifest Ayat) means, "You recite and convey this Book to them day and night, although you are an Ummi (unlettered) who never read a book. Yet, you inform them of what they have (in their own Books). Allah stated that this fact should serve as an example, a clear sign and a proof against them, if they but knew.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Jews break Their Covenants</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  When the Messenger of Allah was sent and Allah reminded the Jews of the covenant that they had with Him, especially concerning Muhammad , Malik bin As-Sayf said, "By Allah! Allah never made a covenant with us about Muhammad, nor did He take a pledge from us at all.'' Allah then revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóæóßõáøóãóÇ ÚóÜåóÏõæÇú ÚóåúÏğÇ äøóÈóĞóåõ İóÑöíŞñ ãøöäúåõã</div><br>  (Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ÃóßúËóÑõåõãú áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (Nay!

Beforehand, the devils used to ascend to heaven and eavesdrop on the conversations of the angels about what will occur on the earth regarding death, other incidents or unseen matters. They would convey this news to the soothsayers, and the soothsayers would in turn convey the news to the people. The people would believe what the soothsayers told them as being true. When the soothsayers trusted the devils, the devils started to lie to them and added other words to the true news that they heard, to the extent of adding seventy false words to each true word. The people recorded these words in some books. Soon after, the Children of Israel said that the Jinns know matters of the Unseen. When Solomon was sent as a Prophet, he collected these books in a box and buried it under his throne; any devil that dared get near the box was burned. Solomon said, `I will not hear of anyone who says that the devils know the Unseen, but I will cut off his head.' When Solomon died and the scholars who knew the truth about Solomon perished, there came another generation. To them, the devil materialized in the shape of a human and said to some of the Children of Israel, `Should I lead you to a treasure that you will never be able to use up' They said. `Yes.' He said, `Dig under this throne,' and he went with them and showed them Solomon's throne. They said to him, `Come closer.' He said, `No. I will wait for you here, and if you do not find the treasure then kill me. ' They dug and found the buried books, and Satan said to them, `Solomon only controlled the humans, devils and birds with this magic.' Thereafter, the news that Solomon was a sorcerer spread among the people, and the Children of Israel adopted these books. When Muhammad came, they disputed with him relying on these books. Hence Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóİóÑó ÓõáóíúãóÜäõ æóáóÜßöäøó ÇáÔøóíúÇØöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (Sulayman did not disbelieve, but the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Story of Harut and Marut, and the Explanation that They were Angels</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Úóáóì Çáúãóáóßóíúäö ÈöÈóÇÈöáó åóÜÑõæÊó æóãóÜÑõæÊó æóãóÇ íõÚóáøöãóÇäö ãöäú ÃóÍóÏò ÍóÊøóì íóŞõæáÇó ÅöäøóãóÇ äóÍúäõ İöÊúäóÉñ İóáÇó ÊóßúİõÑú İóíóÊóÚóáøóãõæäó ãöäúåõãóÇ ãóÇ íõİóÑøöŞõæäó Èöåö Èóíúäó ÇáúãóÑúÁö æóÒóæúÌöåö</div><br>  (And such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, "We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).'' And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife).  There is a difference of opinion regarding this story. It was said that this Ayah denies that anything was sent down to the two angels, as Al-Qurtubi stated and then referred to the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóİóÑó ÓõáóíúãóÜäõ</div><br>  (Sulayman did not disbelieve) saying, "The negation applies in both cases.

The Jews claimed that Gabriel and Michael brought magic down to the two angels, but Allah refuted this false claim.''  Also, Ibn Jarir reported, that Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Úóáóì Çáúãóáóßóíúäö ÈöÈóÇÈöáó</div><br>  (And such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels)  "Allah did not send magic down.''  Also, Ibn Jarir narrated that Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said about,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Úóáóì Çáúãóáóßóíúäö</div><br>  (And such things that came down to the two angels), "Allah did not send magic down to the them.'' Ibn Jarir commented, "This is the correct explanation for this Ayah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóÈóÚõæÇú ãóÇ ÊóÊúáõæÇú ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäõ Úóáóì ãõáúßö ÓõáóíúãóÜäó</div><br>  (They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely) in the lifetime of Sulayman.) meaning, magic. However, neither did Solomon disbelieve nor did Allah send magic with the two angels. The devils, on the other hand, disbelieved and taught magic to the people of the Babylon of Harut and Marut.''  Ibn Jarir continued; "If someone asks about explaining this Ayah in this manner, we say that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóÈóÚõæÇú ãóÇ ÊóÊúáõæÇú ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäõ Úóáóì ãõáúßö ÓõáóíúãóÜäó</div><br>  (They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely) in the lifetime of Sulayman.) means, magic. Solomon neither disbelieved nor did Allah send magic with the two angels. However, the devils disbelieved and taught magic to the people in the Babylon of Harut and Marut, meaning Gabriel and Michael, for Jewish sorcerers claimed that Allah sent magic by the words of Gabriel and Michael to Solomon, son of David. Allah denied this false claim and stated to His Prophet Muhammad that Gabriel and Michael were not sent with magic. Allah also exonerated Solomon from practicing magic, which the devils taught to the people of Babylon by the hands of two men, Harut and Marut. Hence, Harut and Marut were two ordinary men (not angels or Gabriel or Michael).'' These were the words of At-Tabari, and this explanation is not plausible.  Many among the Salaf, said that Harut and Marut were angels who came down from heaven to earth and did what they did as the Ayah stated. To conform this opinion with the fact that the angels are immune from error, we say that Allah had eternal knowledge what these angels would do, just as He had eternal knowledge that Iblis would do as he did, while Allah refered to him being among the angels,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ŞõáúäóÇ áöáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö ÇÓúÌõÏõæÇú áÃóÏóãó İóÓóÌóÏõæÇú ÅöáÇøó ÅöÈúáöíÓó ÃóÈóì </div><br>  (And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves before Adam.'' And they prostrated except Iblis (Satan), he refused) (20:116) and so forth. However, what Harut and Marut did was less evil than what Iblis, may Allah curse him, did. Al-Qurtubi reported this opinion from `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Ka`b Al-Ahbar, As-Suddi and Al-Kalbi. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Learning Magic is Kufr</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõÚóáøöãóÇäö ãöäú ÃóÍóÏò ÍóÊøóì íóŞõæáÇó ÅöäøóãóÇ äóÍúäõ İöÊúäóÉñ İóáÇó ÊóßúİõÑú</div><br>  (But neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, "We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).)  Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi said that Ar-Rabi' bin Anas said that Qays bin `Abbad said that Ibn `Abbas said, "When someone came to the angels to learn magic, they would discourage him and say to him, `We are only a test, so do not fall into disbelief.' They had knowledge of what is good and evil and what constitutes belief or disbelief, and they thus knew that magic is a form of disbelief. When the person who came to learn magic still insisted on learning it, they commanded him to go to such and such place, where if he went, Satan would meet him and teach him magic. When this man would learn magic, the light (of faith) would depart him, and he would see it shining (and flying away) in the sky. He would then proclaim, `O my sorrow! Woe unto me! What should I do.'' Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that this Ayah means, "The angels were sent with magic, so that the people whom Allah willed would be tried and tested. Allah made them promise that they would not teach anyone until first proclaiming, `We are a test for you, do not fall into disbelief.''' It was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Also, Qatadah said, "Allah took their covenant to not teach anyone magic until they said, `We are a test. Therefore, do not fall in disbelief.'''  Also, As-Suddi said, "When a man would come to the two angels they would advise him, `Do not fall into disbelief. We are a test. ' When the man would ignore their advice, they would say, `Go to that pile of ashes and urinate on it.' When he would urinate on the ashes, a light, meaning the light of faith, would depart from him and would shine until it entered heaven. Then something black that appeared to be smoke would descend and enter his ears and the rest of his body, and this is Allah's anger. When he told the angels what happened, they would teach him magic.

Sunayd said that Hajjaj said that Ibn Jurayj commented on this Ayah (2:102), "No one dares practice magic except a disbeliever. As for the Fitnah, it involves trials and freedom of choice.''The scholars who stated that learning magic is disbelief relied on this Ayah for evidence. They also mentioned the Hadith that Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded from `Abdullah, which states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóÊóì ßóÇåöäğÇ Ãóæú ÓóÇÍöÑğÇ İóÕóÏøóŞóåõ ÈöãóÇ íóŞõæáõ İóŞóÏú ßóİóÑ ÈöãóÇ ÃõäúÒöáó Úóáì ãõÍóãøóÏòÕáì Çááå Úáíå æÓáøã»</div><br>  (Whoever came to a soothsayer or a sorcerer and believed in what he said, will have disbelieved in what Allah revealed to Muhammad .)  This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration and there are other Hadiths which support it. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Causing a Separation between the Spouses is One of the Effects of Magic</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíóÊóÚóáøóãõæäó ãöäúåõãóÇ ãóÇ íõİóÑøöŞõæäó Èöåö Èóíúäó ÇáúãóÑúÁö æóÒóæúÌöåö</div><br>  (And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife,) This means, "The people learned magic from Harut and Marut and indulged in evil acts that included separating spouses, even though spouses are close to, and intimately associate with each other.

Iblis says, `No, by Allah, you have not done much.' Another devil would come to him and would say, `I kept inciting so-and-so, until I separated between him and his wife.' Satan would draw him closer and embrace him, saying, `Yes, you did well.')  Separation between a man and his wife occurs here because each spouse imagines that the other spouse is ugly or ill-mannered, etc. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah's Appointed Term supercedes Everything</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ åõã ÈöÖóÂÑøöíäó Èöåö ãöäú ÃóÍóÏò ÅöáÇøó ÈöÅöĞúäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's leave).
