There were no angels among them. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ÅöáÇøó ÑöÌóÇáÇğ äøõæÍöì Åöáóíúåöãú ãøöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúŞõÑóì</div><br>  (And We sent not before you any but men unto whom We revealed, from among the people of townships) 12:109   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ãóÇ ßõäÊõ ÈöÏúÚÇğ ãøöäó ÇáÑøõÓõáö</div><br>  (Say: "I am not a new thing among the Messengers...) 46:9 Allah tells us that the previous nations denied that and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÈóÔóÑñ íóåúÏõæäóäóÇ</div><br>  ("Shall mere men guide us'') 64:6.
