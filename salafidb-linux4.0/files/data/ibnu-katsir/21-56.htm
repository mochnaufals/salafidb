The point here is that Allah is telling us that He gave guidance to Ibrahim aforetime, i.e., He had already guided him at an early age.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõäøóÇ Èöåö ÚóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (and We were Well-Acquainted with him.) means, and he was worthy of that. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ŞóÇáó áÇøğÈöíåö æóŞóæúãöåö ãóÇ åóÜĞöåö ÇáÊøóãóÜËöíáõ ÇáøóÊöì ÃóäÊõãú áóåóÇ ÚóÜßöİõæäó </div><br>  (When he said to his father and his people: "What are these images, to which you are devoted'') This is the guidance which he had been given during his youth: his denunciation of his people's worship of idols instead of Allah. Ibrahim said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ åóÜĞöåö ÇáÊøóãóÜËöíáõ ÇáøóÊöì ÃóäÊõãú áóåóÇ ÚóÜßöİõæäó</div><br>  ("What are these images, to which you are devoted'') meaning, which you worship with such devotion.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú æóÌóÏúäóÂ ÁóÇÈóÂÁóäóÇ áóåóÇ ÚóÜÈöÏöíäó </div><br>  (They said: "We found our fathers worshipping them.'') means, they had no other evidence apart from the misguided actions of their forefathers.

Both you and they are misguided and are not following any straight path.'
