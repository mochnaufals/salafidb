And say to My servants that they should say those words that are best. (Because) Shaytan verily, sows a state of conflict and disagreement among them.

For Shaytan is the enemy of Adam and his descendants, and has been since he refused to prostrate to Adam. His enmity is obvious and manifest. For this reason it is forbidden for a man to point at his Muslim brother with an iron instrument, for Shaytan may cause him to strike him with it. (Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said: "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íõÔöíÑóäøó ÃóÍóÏõßõãú Åöáóì ÃóÎöíåö ÈöÇáÓøöáóÇÍö¡ İóÅöäøóåõ áóÇ íóÏúÑöí ÃóÍóÏõßõãú áóÚóáøó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäó Ãóäú íóäúÒöÚó İöí íóÏöåö İóíóŞóÚó İöí ÍõİúÑóÉò ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (No one of you should point at his brother with a weapon, for he does not know whether Shaytan will cause him to strike him with it and thus be thrown into a pit of Fire.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith with the chain of narration from `Abdur-Razzaq.  </div></body></html>
