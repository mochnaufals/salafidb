Qatadah said, narrating from Ibrahim An-Nakha`i Al-Lakhmi about the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÊóÌöíÈõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö</div><br>  (And He answers those who believe and do righteous good deeds,) -- (this means) they intercede for their brothers; r   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÒöíÏóåõã ãøöä İóÖúáöåö</div><br>  (and gives them increase of His bounty.) -- (this means) they intercede for their brothers' brothers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó áóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ ÔóÏöíÏñ</div><br>  (And as for the disbelievers, theirs will be a severe torment.) -- having mentioned the believers and the great reward that is theirs, Allah then mentions the disbelievers and the severe, painful, agonizing torment that they will find with Him on the Day of Resurrection, the Day when they are brought to account. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reason why Provision is not Increased</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÈóÓóØó Çááøóåõ ÇáÑøöÒúŞó áöÚöÈóÇÏöåö áóÈóÛóæúÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (And if Allah were to extend the provision for His servants, they would surely rebel in the earth,) means, `if We gave them more provision than they need, this would make them rebel and transgress against one another in an arrogant and insolent manner.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöä íõäóÒøöáõ ÈöŞóÏóÑò ãøóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ Åöäøóåõ ÈöÚöÈóÇÏöåö ÎóÈöíÑõ ÈóÕöíÑñ</div><br>  (but He sends down by measure as He wills. Verily, He is, in respect of His servants, the Well-Aware, the All-Seer.) means, but He gives them provision according to what is in their best interests, and He knows best about that. So He makes rich those who deserve to be rich, and He makes poor those who deserve to be poor.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íõäóÒøöáõ ÇáúÛóíúËó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ŞóäóØõæÇú</div><br>  (And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired,) means, after the people have given up hope that rain will fall, He sends it down upon them at their time of need.

(30:49)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóäÔõÑõ ÑóÍúãóÊóåõ</div><br>  (and spreads His mercy. ) means, He bestows it upon all the people who live in that region. Qatadah said, "We were told that a man said to `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, `O Commander of the faithful, no rain has come and the people are in despair.' `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `Rain will be sent upon you,' and he recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íõäóÒøöáõ ÇáúÛóíúËó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ŞóäóØõæÇú æóíóäÔõÑõ ÑóÍúãóÊóåõ æóåõæó Çáúæóáöìøõ ÇáúÍóãöíÏõ </div><br>  (And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and spreads His mercy. And He is the Protector, Worthy of all praise).'' Meaning He is the One Who is in control of His creation, taking care of what will benefit them in this world and the Hereafter, and the consequences of all His decrees and actions are good, for which He is worthy of all praise.  </div></body></html>
