The Qur'an cures all of that. It is also a mercy through which one attains faith and wisdom and seeks goodness. This is only for those who believe in it and accept it as truthful, it is a cure and a mercy only for such people. As for the disbeliever who is wronging himself by his disbelief, when he hears the Qur'an, it only makes him further from the truth and increases him in his disbelief. The problem lies with the disbeliever himself, not with the Qur'an, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú åõÏğì æóÔöİóÂÁñ æóÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó İöì ÁóÇĞóÇäöåöãú æóŞúÑñ æóåõæó Úóáóíúåöãú Úóãğì ÃõæúáóÜÆößó íõäóÇÏóæúäó ãöä ãøóßóÇäò ÈóÚöíÏò</div><br>  (Say: "It is for those who believe, a guide and a cure.
