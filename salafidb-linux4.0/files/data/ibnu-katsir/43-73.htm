When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÇøñÎöáÇóÁõ íóæúãóÆöĞò ÈóÚúÖõåõãú áöÈóÚúÖò ÚóÏõæøñ ÅöáÇøó ÇáúãõÊøóŞöíäó </div><br>  (Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇÊøóÎóĞúÊõãú ãøöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ÃóæúËóÜäÇğ ãøóæóÏøóÉó Èóíúäößõãú İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ Ëõãøó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö íóßúİõÑõ ÈóÚúÖõßõãú ÈöÈóÚúÖò æóíóáúÚóäõ ÈóÚúÖõßõãú ÈóÚúÖÇğ æóãóÃúæóÇßõãõ ÇáäøóÇÑõ æóãóÇ áóßõãú ãøöä äøóÜÕöÑöíäó</div><br>  (You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah.

Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: "When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÚöÈóÇÏö áÇó Îóæúİñ Úóáóíúßõãõ Çáúíóæúãó æóáÇó ÃóäÊõãú ÊóÍúÒóäõæäó </div><br>  (My servants!

So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ æóßóÇäõæÇú ãõÓúáöãöíäó </div><br>  ((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúÎõáõæÇú ÇáúÌóäøóÉó</div><br>  (Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóäÊõãú æóÃóÒúæóÌõßõãú</div><br>  (you and your wives,) means, your counterparts   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõÍúÈóÑõæäó</div><br>  (in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõØóÇİõ Úóáóíúåöãú ÈöÕöÍóÜİò ãøöä ĞóåóÈò æóÃóßúæóÈò</div><br>  (Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (æóİöíåóÇ ãóÇ ÊóÔúÊóåöí ÇáúÃóäúİõÓõ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ÊóÔúÊóåöíåö ÇáÇøñäúİõÓõ</div><br>  (that their souls desire,)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóáóĞøõ ÇáÇøñÚúíõäõ</div><br>  (and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÊõãú İöíåóÇ</div><br>  (and you will therein) means, in Paradise   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÜáöÏõæäó</div><br>  (abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊöáúßó ÇáúÌóäøóÉõ ÇáøóÊöì ÃõæÑöËúÊõãõæåóÇ ÈöãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóßõãú İöíåóÇ İóÜßöåóÉñ ßóËöíÑóÉñ</div><br>  (Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöäúåóÇ ÊóÃúßõáõæäó</div><br>  (of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
