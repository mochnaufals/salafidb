And of course, Muhammad did not do any of this (as the disbelievers claimed).' Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÃóÎóĞúäóÇ ãöäúåõ ÈöÇáúíóãöíäö </div><br>  (We surely would have seized him by his right hand,) It has been said that this means, `We would seize him by the right hand because it is more stronger in grabbing.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó áóŞóØóÚúäóÇ ãöäúåõ ÇáúæóÊöíäó </div><br>  (And then We certainly would have cut off Al-Watin from him,) Ibn `Abbas said, "It (Al-Watin) refers to the artery of the heart, and it is the vein that is attached to the heart.'' This has also been said by `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hakim, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Muslim Al-Batin and Abu Sakhr Humayd bin Ziyad. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, "It (Al-Watin) is the heart, its blood, and whatever is near it.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ãöäßõã ãøöäú ÃóÍóÏò Úóäúåõ ÍóÜÌöÒöíäó </div><br>  (And none of you could have prevented it from him.) means, `none of you would be able to come between Us and him if We wanted to do any of this to him.' The meaning behind all of this is to say that he (Muhammad ) is truthful, righteous and guided because Allah determined what he is to convey from Him, and Allah helps him with fantastic miracles and definite proofs. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõ áóÊóĞúßöÑóÉñ áøöáúãõÊøóŞöíäó </div><br>  (And verily, this (Qur'an) is a Reminder for those who have Taqwa.) meaning, the Qur'an. This is just as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú åõÏğì æóÔöİóÂÁñ æóÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó İöì ÁóÇĞóÇäöåöãú æóŞúÑñ æóåõæó Úóáóíúåöãú Úóãğì</div><br>  (Say: "It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Qur'an) is blindness for them.'') Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóÇ áóäóÚúáóãõ Ãóäøó ãöäßõã ãøõßóĞøöÈöíäó </div><br>  (And verily, We know that there are some among you that deny (this Qur'an). ) meaning, with this explanation and clarification, there will still be among you those who reject the Qur'an. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõ áóÍóÓúÑóÉñ Úóáóì ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And indeed it (this Qur'an) will be an anguish for the disbelievers (on the Day of Resurrection).) Ibn Jarir said, "And verily this rejection will be anguish for the disbelievers on the Day of Judgement.'' He (Ibn Jarir) also mentioned a similar statement from Qatadah. It is possible that the meaning of the pronoun (it) may also refer to the Qur'an, in which case the verse would mean that the Qur'an and belief in it are a cause of anguish for the disbelievers. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó ÓóáóßúäóÇåõ İöí ŞõáõæÈö ÇáúãõÌúÑöãöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó Èöåö</div><br>  (Thus have We caused it (the denial of the Qur'an) to enter the hearts of the criminals. They will not believe in it.) (26:200,201) And Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍöíáó Èóíúäóåõãú æóÈóíúäó ãóÇ íóÔúÊóåõæäó</div><br>  (And a barrier will be set between them and that which they desire) (34:54). Therefore, Allah says here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõ áóÍóŞøõ ÇáúíóŞöíäö </div><br>  (And verily, it (this Qur'an) is an absolute truth with certainty.) meaning, the right and truthful news in which there is no doubt, suspicion or confusion. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÇÓúãö ÑóÈøößó ÇáúÚóÙöíãö </div><br>  (So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.) meaning, He Who sent down this magnificent Qur'an. This is the end of the explanation (Tafsir) of Surat Al-Haqqah. And to Allah belong all praise and blessings.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
