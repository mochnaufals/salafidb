Woe that Day to the deniers!) Ibn Jarir said this. Then Allah reminding His creatures of His favor, and using the beginning of creation to support the idea of repeating it, He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú äóÎúáõŞßøõã ãøöä ãøóÂÁò ãøóåöíäò </div><br>  (Did We not create you from a despised water) meaning, weak and despised in comparison to the power of the Creator.

Mujahid said, "It holds the dead so that nothing is seen of it.'' Ash-Sha`bi said, "Its interior is for your dead and its surface is for your living.''
