He is the Almighty, and there is none mightier than Him; He is the One Who is able to do all things; He is the Owner of all things and everything is under His control and power. Mujahid said, "This was revealed concerning Quraysh.'' As-Suddi said, "They did not venerate Him as He deserves to be venerated.'' Muhammad bin Ka`b said, "If they had made a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him, they would not have lied.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ŞóÏóÑõæÇú Çááøóåó ÍóŞøó ŞóÏúÑöåö</div><br>  (They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him.) "These are the disbeliever who did not believe that Allah had power over them. Whoever believes that Allah is able to do all things, has made a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him, and whoever does not believe that, has not made a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him.'' Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning this Ayah and how it and other Ayat like it are to be interpreted and accepted without any attempts to twist or change the meaning. Concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ŞóÏóÑõæÇú Çááøóåó ÍóŞøó ŞóÏúÑöåö</div><br>  (They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him. ) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "One of the rabbis came to the Messenger of Allah and said, `O Muhammad! We learn that Allah will put the heavens on one finger, the earths on one finger, the trees on one finger, the water and dust on one finger, and the rest of creation on one finger, then He will say: I am the King.' The Messenger of Allah smiled so broadly that his molars could be seen, in confirmation of what the rabbi had said. Then the Messenger of Allah recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ŞóÏóÑõæÇú Çááøóåó ÍóŞøó ŞóÏúÑöåö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ÌóãöíÚÜÇğ ŞóÈúÖóÜÊõåõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö</div><br>  (They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand).'' Al-Bukhari also recorded this in other places of his Sahih. It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad and Muslim, and by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in the (books of) Tafsir in their Sunans. Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞúÈöÖõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì ÇáúÃóÑúÖó¡ æóíóØúæöí ÇáÓøóãóÇÁó Èöíóãöíäöåö¡ Ëõãøó íóŞõæáõ: ÃóäóÇ Çáúãóáößõ¡ Ãóíúäó ãõáõæßõ ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¿»</div><br>  (Allah will grasp the earth and roll up the heavens in His Right Hand, then He will say: "I am the King, where are the kings of the earth'')'' This version was recorded only by Al-Bukhari; Muslim recorded another version. Al-Bukhari also recorded from Ibn `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÊóÈóÇÑóßó æóÊóÚóÇáóì íóŞúÈöÖõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÇáúÃóÑóÖöíäó Úóáóì ÃõÕúÈõÚò¡ æóÊóßõæäõ ÇáÓøóãæóÇÊõ Èöíóãöíäöåö¡ Ëõãøó íóŞõæáõ: ÃóäóÇ Çáúãóáöß»</div><br>  (On the Day of Resurrection, Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will grasp the earth with one finger, and the heavens will be in His Right Hand, then He will say, "I am the King.'') This version was also recorded by Al-Bukhari It is recorded that Ibn `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah recited this Ayah on the Minbar one day:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ŞóÏóÑõæÇú Çááøóåó ÍóŞøó ŞóÏúÑöåö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ÌóãöíÚÜÇğ ŞóÈúÖóÜÊõåõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö æóÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊõ ãóØúæöíøóÜÊñ Èöíóãöíäöåö ÓõÈúÍóÜäóåõ æóÊóÚóÇáóì ÚóãøóÇ íõÔúÑößõæäó </div><br>  (They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him. On the Day of Resurrection the whole earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified be He, and High be He above all that they associate as partners with Him!) The Messenger of Allah said while moving his hand forward and backward:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõãóÌøöÏõ ÇáÑøóÈøõ äóİúÓóåõ: ÃóäóÇ ÇáúÌóÈøóÇÑõ¡ ÃóäóÇ ÇáúãõÊóßóÈøöÑõ¡ ÃóäóÇ Çáúãóáößõ¡ ÃóäóÇ ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ¡ ÃóäóÇ ÇáúßóÑöíã»</div><br>  (And the Lord will glorify Himself, saying "I am Compeller, I am the Proud, I am the King, I am the Mighty, I am the Most Generous.'') And the Minbar shook so much that we feared that the Messenger of Allah would fall.'' This was also recorded by Muslim, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah.  </div></body></html>
