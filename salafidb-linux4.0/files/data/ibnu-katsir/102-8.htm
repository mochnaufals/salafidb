This delays you until death comes to you and you visit the graves, thus becoming its inhabitants. In Sahih Al-Bukhari, it is recorded in the Book of Ar-Riqaq (Narrations that soften the Heart) from Anas bin Malik, who reported that Ubayy bin Ka`b said, "We used to think that this was a part of the Qur'an until the Ayah was revealed which says;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáúåóÜßõãõ ÇáÊøóßøóÇËõÑõ </div><br>  (The mutual increase diverts you.)'' He was referring to the Hadith in which the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú ßóÇäó áöÇÈúäö ÂÏóãó æóÇÏò ãöäú ĞóåóÈ»</div><br>  (If the Son of Adam had a valley of gold, he would desire another like it...) Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir that he said, "I came to the Messenger of Allah while he was saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáúåóÜßõãõ ÇáÊøóßøóÇËõÑõ </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõ ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó: ãóÇáöí ãóÇáöí¡ æóåóáú áóßó ãöäú ãóÇáößó ÅöáøóÇ ãóÇ ÃóßóáúÊó İóÃóİúäóÜíúÊó¡ Ãóæú áóÈöÓúÊó İóÃóÈúáóíúÊó¡ Ãóæú ÊóÕóÏøóŞúÊó İóÃóãúÖóíúÊó¿»</div><br>  ((The mutual increase diverts you.)'' He was referring to the Hadith in which the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú ßóÇäó áöÇÈúäö ÂÏóãó æóÇÏò ãöäú ĞóåóÈ»</div><br>  (If the Son of Adam had a valley of gold, he would desire another like it...) Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir that he said, "I came to the Messenger of Allah while he was saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáúåóÜßõãõ ÇáÊøóßøóÇËõÑõ </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõ ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó: ãóÇáöí ãóÇáöí¡ æóåóáú áóßó ãöäú ãóÇáößó ÅöáøóÇ ãóÇ ÃóßóáúÊó İóÃóİúäóÜíúÊó¡ Ãóæú áóÈöÓúÊó İóÃóÈúáóíúÊó¡ Ãóæú ÊóÕóÏøóŞúÊó İóÃóãúÖóíúÊó¿»</div><br>  ((The mutual increase diverts you.)( The Son of Adam says, "My wealth, my wealth.'' But do you get anything (of benefit) from your wealth except for that which you ate and you finished it, or that which you clothed yourself with and you wore it out, or that which you gave as charity and you have spent it)'' Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ ÇáúÚóÈúÏõ: ãóÇáöí ãóÇáöí¡ æóÅöäøóãóÇ áóåõ ãöäú ãóÇáöåö ËóáóÇËñ: ãóÇ Ãóßóáó İóÃóİúäóì¡ Ãóæú áóÈöÓó İóÃóÈúáóì¡ Ãóæú ÊóÕóÏøóŞó İóÃóãúÖóì¡ æóãóÇ Óöæóì Ğóáößó İóĞóÇåöÈñ æóÊóÇÑößõåõ áöáäøóÇÓ»</div><br>  (The servant says "My wealth, my wealth.'' Yet he only gets three (benefits) from his wealth: that which he eats and finishes, that which he eats and finishes, that which he wears until it is worn out, or that which he gives in charity and it is spent. Everything else other than that will go away and leave him for the people.) Muslim was alone in recording this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÊúÈóÚõ ÇáúãóíøöÊó ËóáóÇËóÉñ¡ İóíóÑúÌöÚõ ÇËúäóÇäö æóíóÈúŞóì ãóÚóåõ æóÇÍöÏñ: íóÊúÈóÚõåõ Ãóåúáõåõ æóãóÇáõåõ æóÚóãóáõåõ¡ İóíóÑúÌöÚõ Ãóåúáõåõ æóãóÇáõåõ¡ æóíóÈúŞóì Úóãóáõå»</div><br>  (Three things follow the deceased person, and two of them return while one remains behind with him. The things which follow him are his family, his wealth and his deeds. His family and his wealth return while his deeds remain.) This Hadith has also been recorded by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóåúÑóãõ ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó æóíóÈúŞóì ãöäúåõ ÇËúäóÊóÇäö: ÇáúÍöÑúÕõ æóÇáúÃóãóá»</div><br>  (The Son of Adam becomes old with senility, but yet two things remain with him: greed and hope.) Both of them (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded this Hadith in the Two Sahihs. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Threat of seeing Hell and being questioned about the Delights</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó Óóæúİó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó - Ëõãøó ßóáÇøó Óóæúİó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Nay! you shall come to know! Again nay! you shall come to know!) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "This is a threat after a threat.'' Ad-Dahhak said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó Óóæúİó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Nay! you shall come to know!) "Meaning, `O you disbelievers.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ßóáÇøó Óóæúİó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Again nay! you shall come to know!) meaning, `O you believers.''' Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó áóæú ÊóÚúáóãõæäó Úöáúãó ÇáúíóŞöíäö </div><br>  (Nay! you shall come to know! Again nay! you shall come to know!) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "This is a threat after a threat.'' Ad-Dahhak said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó Óóæúİó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Nay! you shall come to know!) "Meaning, `O you disbelievers.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ßóáÇøó Óóæúİó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Again nay! you shall come to know!) meaning, `O you believers.''' Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó áóæú ÊóÚúáóãõæäó Úöáúãó ÇáúíóŞöíäö </div><br>  (Nay! If you knew with a sure knowledge.) meaning, `if you knew with true knowledge, you would not be diverted by rivalry for wealth away from seeking the abode of the Hereafter until you reach the graves.' Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÊóÑóæõäøó ÇáúÌóÍöíãó - Ëõãøó áóÊóÑóæõäøóåóÇ Úóíúäó ÇáúíóŞöíäö </div><br>  (Verily, you shall see the blazing Fire! And again you shall see it with certainty of sight!) This is the explanation of the previous threat which was in Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó Óóæúİó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó - Ëõãøó ßóáÇøó Óóæúİó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Nay! you shall come to know! Again nay! you shall come to know!) Thus, Allah threatens them with this situation, which is what the people of the Fire will see. It is a Fire, which if it exhaled one breath, every angel who is near (to Allah) and every Prophet who was sent would all fall down on their knees due to fear, awe and the sight of its horrors. This is based upon what has been reported in the narrations concerning it. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó áóÊõÓúÜóáõäøó íóæúãóÆöĞò Úóäö ÇáäøóÚöíãö </div><br>  (Then on that Day you shall be asked about the delights!) meaning, `on that Day you all will be questioned concerning your gratitude towards the favors that Allah blessed you with, such as health, safety, sustenance and other things. You will be asked did you return His favors by being thankful to Him and worshipping Him.' Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Husayn bin `Ali As-Suda'i narrated to him from Al-Walid bin Al-Qasim, who reported from Yazid bin Kaysan, who reported from Abi Hazim, who reported from Abu Hurayrah that he said, "Once while Abu Bakr and `Umar were sitting, the Prophet came to them and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÃóÌúáóÓóßõãóÇ ååõäóÇ¿»</div><br>  (What has caused you two to sit here) They replied, `By He Who has sent you with the truth, nothing has brought us out of our houses except hunger.' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí ÈóÚóËóäöí ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö ãóÇ ÃóÎúÑóÌóäöí ÛóíúÑõå»</div><br>  (By He Who has sent me with the truth, nothing has brought me out other than this.) So they went until they came to the house of a man from the Ansar, and the woman of the house received them. The Prophet said to her,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóíúäó İõáóÇäñ¿»</div><br>  (Where is so-and-so) She replied, `He went to fetch some drinking water for us.' So the man came carrying his bucket and he said, `Welcome. Nothing has visited the servants (of Allah) better than a Prophet who has visited me today.' Then he hung his bucket near a palm tree, and climbed it and returned to them with a cluster of dates. So the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ßõäúÊó ÇÌúÊóäóÜíúÊó¿»</div><br>  Why didn't you pick (some of them)) The man replied, `I wanted you to choose with your own eyes.' Then he took a blade (to slaughter a sheep) and the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöíøóÇßó æóÇáúÍóáõæÈ»</div><br>  (Do not slaughter one that gives milk.) So he slaughtered a sheep for them that day and they all ate. Then the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÊõÓúÃóáõäøó Úóäú åóĞóÇ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ ÃóÎúÑóÌóßõãú ãöäú ÈõíõæÊößõãõ ÇáúÌõæÚõ¡ İóáóãú ÊóÑúÌöÚõæÇ ÍóÊøóì ÃóÕóÈúÊõãú åóĞóÇ¡ İóåóĞóÇ ãöäó ÇáäøóÚöíã»</div><br>  (You will be asked about this on the Day of Judgement. Hunger caused you to come out of your homes and you did not return until you had eaten this meal. So this is from the delights.)'' Muslim also recorded this Hadith. It has been confirmed in Sahih Al-Bukhari and the Sunans of At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah from Ibn `Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äöÚúãóÊóÇäö ãóÛúÈõæäñ İöíåöãóÇ ßóËöíÑñ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö: ÇáÕøöÍøóÉõ æóÇáúİóÑóÇÛ»</div><br>  (Two favors are treated unjustly by most people: health and free time.) This means that the people are lacking gratitude for these two favors. They do fulfill their obligations to them. Therefore, whoever does not maintain the right that is obligatory upon him, then he is unjust. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó ŞÇá ÚİÇä: íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö : íóÇ ÇÈúäó ÂÏóãó¡ ÍóãóáúÊõßó Úóáóì ÇáúÎóíúáö æóÇáúÅöÈöáö¡ æóÒóæøóÌúÊõßó ÇáäøöÓóÇÁó¡ æóÌóÚóáúÊõßó ÊóÑúÈóÚõ æóÊóÑúÃóÓõ¡ İóÃóíúäó ÔõßúÑõ Ğóáößó¿»</div><br>  (Allah the Mighty and Majestic says on the Day of Judgement, "O Son of Adam! I made you ride upon the horses and camels, I gave you women to marry, and I made you reside and rule (in the earth). So where is the thanks for that'')  Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith in this manner. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Takathur, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
