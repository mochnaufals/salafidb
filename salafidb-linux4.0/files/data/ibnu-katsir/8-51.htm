Ibn Jurayj said that Mujahid said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÏúÈóÜÑóåõãú</div><br>  (and their backs), refers to their back sides, as happened on the day of Badr. Ibn Jurayj also reported from Ibn `Abbas, "When the idolators faced the Muslims in Badr, the Muslims smote their faces with swords. When they gave flight, the angels smote their rear ends.''  Although these Ayat are describing Badr, they are general in the case of every disbeliever. This is why Allah did not make His statement here restrictive to the disbelievers at Badr,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÊóÑóì ÅöĞú íóÊóæóİøóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ íóÖúÑöÈõæäó æõÌõæåóåõãú æóÃóÏúÈóÜÑóåõãú</div><br>  (And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve (at death); they smite their faces and their backs,)  In Surat Al-Qital (or Muhammad chapter 47) there is a similar Ayah, as well as in Surat Al-An`am,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÊóÑóì ÅöĞö ÇáÙøóÜáöãõæäó İöì ÛóãóÑóÇÊö ÇáúãóæúÊö æóÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ ÈóÇÓöØõæÇú ÃóíúÏöíåöãú ÃóÎúÑöÌõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóßõãõ</div><br>  (And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands (saying): "Deliver your souls!'') 6:93  The angels stretch their hands and smite the disbelievers by Allah's command, since their souls refuse to leave their bodies, so they are taken out by force. This occurs when the angels give them the news of torment and Allah's anger. There is a Hadith narrated from Al-Bara' that when the angel of death attends the disbeliever at the time of death, he comes to him in a terrifying and disgusting shape, saying, "Get out, O wicked soul, to fierce hot wind, boiling water and a shadow of black smoke.'' The disbeliever's soul then scatters throughout his body, but the angels retrieve it, just as a needle is retrieved from wet wool. In this case, veins and nerve cells will be still attached to the soul. Allah states here that angels bring news of the torment of the Fire to the disbelievers. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó ÈöãóÇ ŞóÏøóãóÊú ÃóíúÏöíßõãú</div><br>  (This is because of that which your hands forwarded.) meaning, this punishment is the recompense of the evil deeds that you have committed in the life of the world. This is your reckoning from Allah for your deeds,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó Çááøóåó áóíúÓó ÈöÙóáøóÜãò áøöáúÚóÈöíÏö</div><br>  a(And verily, Allah is not unjust to His servants.)  Certainly, Allah does not wrong any of His creatures, for He is the Just, who never puts anything in an inappropriate place. Honored, Glorified, Exalted and Praised be He, the All-Rich, Worthy of all praise. Muslim recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì íóŞõæáõ: íóÇ ÚöÈóÇÏöí Åöäøöí ÍóÑøóãúÊõ ÇáÙøõáúãó Úóáóì äóİúÓöí æóÌóÚóáúÊõåõ Èóíúäóßõãú ãõÍóÑøóãğÇ İóáóÇ ÊóÙóÇáóãõæÇ¡ íóÇ ÚöÈóÇÏöí ÅöäøóãóÇ åöíó ÃóÚúãóÇáõßõãú ÃõÍúÕöíåóÇ áóßõãú İóãóäú æóÌóÏó ÎóíúÑğÇ İóáúíóÍúãóÏö Çááåó æóãóäú æóÌóÏó ÛóíúÑó Ğóáößó İóáóÇ íóáõæãóäøó ÅöáøóÇ äóİúÓóå»</div><br>  (Allah, the Exalted, said, `O My servants! I have prohibited injustice for Myself, and made it prohibited to you between each other. Therefore, do not commit injustice against each other. O My servants! It is your deeds that I am keeping count of, so whoever found something good, let him praise Allah for it. Whoever found other than that, has only himself to blame.)  This is why Allah said,  </div></body></html>
