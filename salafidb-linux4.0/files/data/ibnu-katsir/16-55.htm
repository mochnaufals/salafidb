It was also reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "It means obligatory.'' Mujahid said: "It means purely for Him,'' i.e., worship is due to Him Alone, from whoever is in the heavens and on earth. As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÛóíúÑó Ïöíäö Çááøóåö íóÈúÛõæäó æóáóåõ ÃóÓúáóãó ãóä İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö ØóæúÚğÇ æóßóÑúåğÇ æóÅöáóíúåö íõÑúÌóÚõæäó </div><br>  (Do they seek other than the religion of Allah, while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned.) (3:83) This is in accordance with the opinion of Ibn `Abbas and `Ikrimah, which is that this Ayah is merely stating the case. According to the opinion of Mujahid, it is by way of instruction, i.e., it is saying: You had better fear associating partners in worship with Me, and be sincere in your obedience to Me. As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇó áöáøóåö ÇáÏøöíäõ ÇáúÎóÇáöÕõ</div><br>  (Surely, the pure religion (sincere devotion) is for Allah only.) (39:3)  Then Allah tells us that He is the One Who has the power to benefit and harm, and that the provisions, blessings, good health and help, His servants enjoy are from His bounty and graciousness towards them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÅöĞóÇ ãóÓøóßõãõ ÇáÖøõÑøõ İóÅöáóíúåö ÊóÌúÜóÑõæäó</div><br>  (Then, when harm touches you, to Him you cry aloud for help.) meaning because you know that none has the power to remove that harm except for Him, so when you are harmed, you turn to ask Him for help and beg Him for aid. As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÓøóßõãõ ÇáúÖøõÑøõ İöì ÇáúÈóÍúÑö Öóáøó ãóä ÊóÏúÚõæäó ÅöáÇó ÅöíøóÇåõ İóáóãøóÇ äóÌøóÜßõãú Åöáóì ÇáúÈóÑøö ÃóÚúÑóÖúÊõãú æóßóÇäó ÇáÅöäúÓóÜäõ ßóİõæÑğÇ </div><br>  (And when harm touches you at sea, those that you call upon vanish, except for Him. But when He brings you safe to land, you turn away. And man is ever ungrateful.)(17:67)  Here, Allah tells us:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÅöĞóÇ ßóÔóİó ÇáÖøõÑøó Úóäúßõãú ÅöĞóÇ İóÑöíŞñ ãøöäúßõã ÈöÑóÈøöåöãú íõÔúÑößõæäó áöíóßúİõÑõæÇú ÈöãóÂ ÁÇÊóíúäóÜåõãú</div><br>  (Then, when He has removed the harm from you, behold! some of you associate others in worship with their Lord (Allah). So they are ungrateful for that which We have given them!) (16:54-55) It was said that the Lam here (translated as "So'') is an indicator of sequence, or that it serves an explanatory function, meaning, `We decreed that they would conceal the truth and deny the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon them. He is the One Who bestows blessings and the One Who removes distress.' Then Allah threatens them, saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóãóÊøóÚõæÇú</div><br>  (Then enjoy yourselves) meaning, do what you like and enjoy what you have for a little while.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (but you will soon come to know.) meaning the consequences of that.  </div></body></html>
