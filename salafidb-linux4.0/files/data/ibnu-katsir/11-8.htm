He mentions that His Throne was over the water before that, just as Imam Ahmad recorded that `Imran bin Husayn said, "The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇŞúÈóáõæÇ ÇáúÈõÔúÑóì íóÇ Èóäöí Êóãöíã»</div><br>  (Accept the glad tidings, O tribe of Tamim!)

Therefore, inform us about the beginning of this matter and how it was.' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóÇäó Çááåõ ŞóÈúáó ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò¡ æóßóÇäó ÚóÑúÔõåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÇÁö¡ æóßóÊóÈó İöí ÇááøóæúÍö ÇáúãóÍúİõæÙö ĞößúÑó ßõáøö ÔóíúÁ»</div><br>  (Allah was before everything and His Throne was over the water. He then wrote in the Preserved Tablet mentioning everything.) Then a man came to me and said, "O `Imran, your she camel has escaped from her fetter.'' I then went out after her and I do not know what was said after I left.'' This Hadith has been recorded in the Two Sahihs of Al-Bukhari and Muslim with a variety of wordings. In Sahih Muslim, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ŞóÏøóÑó ãóŞóÇÏöíÑó ÇáúÎóáóÇÆöŞö ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú íóÎúáõŞó ÇáÓøóãæóÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖó ÈöÎóãúÓöíäó Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉò æóßóÇäó ÚóÑúÔõåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÇÁ»</div><br>  (Verily Allah measured the amount of sustenance of the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and His Throne was over the water.) Under the explanation of this verse, Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÇáó Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó: ÃóäúİöŞú ÃõäúİöŞú Úóáóíúß»</div><br>  (Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said, `Spend and I will spend on you.')

He also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóİóÑóÃóíúÊõãú ãóÇ ÃóäúİóŞó ãõäúĞõ ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãæóÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖó İóÅöäøóåõ áóãú íóÛöÖú ãóÇ İöí íóãöíäöåö¡ æóßóÇäó ÚóÑúÔõåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÇÁö¡ æóÈöíóÏöåö ÇáúãöíÒóÇäõ íóÎúİöÖõ æóíóÑúİóÚ»</div><br>  (Have you seen what has been spent since the creation of the heavens and the earth Verily it does not diminish what is in His Right Hand (in the slightest) and His Throne was over the water. In His Hand is the Scale and he lowers and raises it.) Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíóÈúáõæóßõãú Ãóíøõßõãú ÃóÍúÓóäõ ÚóãóáÇğ</div><br>  (that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds.) This means that He created the heavens and the earth for the benefit of His servants, whom He created so that they may worship Him and not associate anything with Him as a partner. Allah did not create this creation (of the heavens and the earth) out of mere frivolity. This is similar to His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÂÁó æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó æóãóÇ ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ ÈóÜØöáÇğ Ğóáößó Ùóäøõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú İóæóíúáñ áøöáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö </div><br>  (And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose!

Concerning the statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóíøõßõãú ÃóÍúÓóäõ ÚóãóáÇğ</div><br>  (which of you is the best in deeds.) It is important to note here that Allah did not say, "Which of you has done the most deeds.'' Rather, He said, "Best in deeds.'' A deed cannot be considered a good deed until it is done sincerely for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and it must be in accordance with the legislation of the Messenger of Allah . Whenever a deed lacks one of these conditions, then it is null and void. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Polytheists hasten their Torment by arguing against Resurrection after Death</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöä ŞõáúÊó Åöäøóßõãú ãøóÈúÚõæËõæäó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ÇáúãóæúÊö</div><br>  (But if you were to say to them: "You shall indeed be raised up after death.'') Allah, the Exalted, is saying, "O Muhammad, if you were to inform these polytheists that Allah is going to resurrect them after their death, just as He created them originally (they would still reject).'' Even though they know that Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who created the heavens and the earth, just as He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöä ÓóÃóáúÊóåõã ãøóäú ÎóáóŞóåõãú áóíóŞõæáõäøó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: "Allah.'')43:87  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöä ÓóÃóáúÊóåõãú ãøóäú ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó æóÓóÎøóÑó ÇáÔøóãúÓó æóÇáúŞóãóÑó áóíóŞõæáõäøó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (And if you were to ask them: "Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon'' They will surely reply: "Allah.'') 29:61 Even after their awareness of this (Allah's creating), they still reject the resurrection and the promised return on the Day of Judgement. Yet, in reference to ability, the resurrection is easier (for Allah to perform) than the original creation. As Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íóÈúÏóÃõ ÇáúÎóáúŞó Ëõãøó íõÚöíÏõåõ æóåõæó Ãóåúæóäõ Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it (after it has perished); and this is easier for Him.) 30:27 Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ ÎóáúŞõßõãú æóáÇó ÈóÚúËõßõãú ÅöáÇøó ßóäóİúÓò æóÍöÏóÉò</div><br>  (The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as (the creation and resurrection of) a single person.) 31:28 Concerning the statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäú åóÜĞóÇ ÅöáÇøó ÓöÍúÑñ ãøõÈöíäñ</div><br>  (This is nothing but obvious magic.) The polytheists say this due to their disbelief and obstinacy. They say, "We do not believe your claim that resurrection will occur.'' They also say, "He (Muhammad) only says this (resurrection of the dead) because he is bewitched, and he wants you to follow him in what his bewitchment tells him. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöäú ÃóÎøóÑúäóÇ Úóäúåõãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó Åöáóì ÃõãøóÉò ãøóÚúÏõæÏóÉò</div><br>  (And if We delay the torment for them till a determined term,) Allah, the Exalted, is saying "If We delay the torment and the destruction of these polytheists until an appointed time and a period determined, and We promise them a specific time period (of life), they would still say, in rejection and haste;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ íóÍúÈöÓõåõ</div><br>  (What keeps it back) They mean by this, "What delays this torment from overtaking us'' Both rejection and doubt are their very nature. Therefore, they have no escape or refuge from the torment. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meanings of the Word Ummah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The word Ummah is used in the Qur'an and Sunnah with a number of different meanings. Sometimes when it is used it means a specified period of time. An example is the statement of Allah, the Exalted, in this verse,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì ÃõãøóÉò ãøóÚúÏõæÏóÉò</div><br>  (till a determined Ummah (term),) This is also the meaning in the statement of Allah in Surah Yusuf,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöì äóÌóÇ ãöäúåõãóÇ æóÇÏøóßóÑó ÈóÚúÏó ÃõãøóÉò</div><br>  (Then the man who was released, now after Ummah (some time) remembered.) 12:45 The word Ummah is also used to refer to the Imam (leader) who is followed. An example of this is in the statement of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó ßóÇäó ÃõãøóÉğ ŞóÜäöÊğÇ áöáøóåö ÍóäöíİğÇ æóáóãú íóßõ ãöäó ÇáúãõÔúÑößöíäó </div><br>  (Verily, Ibrahim was an Ummah, obedient to Allah, Hanif, and he was not of those who were polytheists.) 16:120 The word Ummah is also used to mean religion and religious creed. This is as Allah mentions concerning the polytheists, that they said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ æóÌóÏúäóÂ ÁóÇÈóÂÁóäóÇ Úóáóì ÃõãøóÉò æóÅöäøóÇ Úóáóì ÁóÇËóÜÑöåöã ãøõŞúÊóÏõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, we found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps. ) 43:23 The word Ummah is also used to mean a group (of people). This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóãøóÇ æóÑóÏó ãóÂÁó ãóÏúíóäó æóÌóÏó Úóáóíúåö ÃõãøóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö íóÓúŞõæäó</div><br>  (And when he arrived at the water (well) of Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÈóÚóËúäóÇ İöì ßõáøö ÃõãøóÉò ÑøóÓõæáÇğ Ãóäö ÇÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáúØøóÜÛõæÊó</div><br>  (And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): "Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut.'') 16:36 Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáößõáøö ÃõãøóÉò ÑøóÓõæáñ İóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁó ÑóÓõæáõåõãú ŞõÖöìó Èóíúäóåõãú ÈöÇáúŞöÓúØö æóåõãú áÇó íõÙúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (And for every Ummah there is a Messenger; when their Messenger comes, the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.) 10:47 The meaning of Ummah here is those people who have had a Messenger sent among them. The meaning of Ummah in this context includes the believers and the disbelievers among them. This is like what has been recorded in Sahih Muslim,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö áóÇ íóÓúãóÚõ Èöí ÃóÍóÏñ ãöäú åóĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉö íóåõæÏöíøñ æóáóÇ äóÕúÑóÇäöíøñ Ëõãøó áóÇ íõÄúãöäõ Èöí ÅöáøóÇ ÏóÎóáó ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! there is no one of this Ummah, whether he be a Jew or Christian, who hears of me and does not believe in me, except that he will enter the Hell- fire.) In reference to the Ummah of followers, then they are those who believe in the Messengers, as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõäÊõãú ÎóíúÑó ÃõãøóÉò ÃõÎúÑöÌóÊú áöáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (You (the followers of Prophet Muhammad) are the best Ummah ever raised up for mankind.) 3:110 In the Sahih the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÃóŞõæáõ: ÃõãøóÊöí ÃõãøóÊöí»</div><br>  (Then I will say, "My Ummah (followers), my Ummah!'') The word Ummah is also used to mean a sect or party.
