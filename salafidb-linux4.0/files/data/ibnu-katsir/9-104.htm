Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and accepts the Sadaqat, and that Allah alone is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to collect the Zakah and Its Benefits</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah commanded His Messenger to take Sadaqah from the Muslims' money to purify and sanctify them with it. This Ayah is general, even though some said that it refers specifically to those who mixed good and evil deeds, who admitted to their errors. Some bedouin later thought that paying Zakah to the Leader was not legislated except to the Messenger himself, using this Ayah as evidence,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎõĞú ãöäú Ãóãúæóáöåöãú ÕóÏóŞóÉğ</div><br>  (Take Sadaqah from their wealth.) Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and other Companions refuted this ill comprehension and fought against them until they paid the Zakah to the Khalifah, just as they used to pay it to the Messenger of Allah . As-Siddiq said, "By Allah! If they abstain from paying a bridle that they used to pay to the Messenger of Allah , I will fight them for refraining from paying it.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÕóáøö Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (and Salli for them), means, supplicate for them, and ask Allah to forgive them. In the Sahih, Muslim recorded that `Abdullah bin Abi Awfa said, "Whenever the Prophet was brought charity, he used to invoke Allah for those who brought it. My father also brought his charity and the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó Õóáøö Úóáóì Âáö ÃóÈöí Ãóæúİóì»</div><br>  (O Allah! I invoke You for the family of Abu Awfa.)'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÕóáóæóÊóßó Óóßóäñ áøóåõãú</div><br>  (Verily, your Salat are a Sakan for them), means, a mercy for them, according to Ibn `Abbas. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÓóãöíÚñ</div><br>  (and Allah is All-Hearer,) of your invocation (O Muhammad),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáöíãñ</div><br>  (All-Knower.) in those who deserve your invocation on their behalf, who are worthy of it. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú íóÚúáóãõæÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó åõæó íóŞúÈóáõ ÇáÊøóæúÈóÉó Úóäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö æóíóÃúÎõĞõ ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÜÊö</div><br>  (Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and accepts the Sadaqat) This Ayah encourages reverting to repentance and giving charity, for each of these actions erases, deletes and eradicate sins. Allah states that He accepts the repentance of those who repent to Him, as well as charity from pure resources, for Allah accepts it with His Right Hand and raises it for its giver until even a date becomes as large as Mount Uhud. Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó íóŞúÈóáõ ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉó æóíóÃúÎõĞõåóÇ Èöíóãöíäöåö İóíõÑóÈøöíåóÇ áöÃóÍóÏößõãú ßóãóÇ íõÑóÈøöí ÃóÍóÏõßõãú ãõåúÑóåõ¡ ÍóÊøóì Åöäøó ÇááøõŞúãóÉó áóÊóßõæäõ ãöËúáó ÃõÍõÏ»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah accepts charity, receives it in His Right Hand and develops it for its giver, just as one of you raises his pony, until the bite of food becomes as large as Uhud.) wThe Book of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, testifies to this Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú íóÚúáóãõæÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó åõæó íóŞúÈóáõ ÇáÊøóæúÈóÉó Úóäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö æóíóÃúÎõĞõ ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÜÊö</div><br>  (Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and accepts the Sadaqat), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóãúÍóŞõ Çááøóåõ ÇáúÑøöÈóæÇú æóíõÑúÈöì ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÜÊö</div><br>  (Allah will destroy Riba and will give increase for Sadaqat.) 2:276 `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "Charity falls in Allah's Hand before it falls in the needy's hand,'' he then recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú íóÚúáóãõæÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó åõæó íóŞúÈóáõ ÇáÊøóæúÈóÉó Úóäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö æóíóÃúÎõĞõ ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÜÊö</div><br>  (Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and accepts the Sadaqat).  </div></body></html>
