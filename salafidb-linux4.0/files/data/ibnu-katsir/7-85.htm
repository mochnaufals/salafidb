And to (the people of) Madyan, (We sent) their brother Shu`ayb. He said: "O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him.

Shu`ayb was the son of Mikil bin Yashjur. And in the Syrian language, his name was Yathrun (Jethro)''. I (Ibn Kathir) say, Madyan was the name of the tribe and also a city that is close to Ma`an on route to the Hijaz (from Ash-Sham). Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóãøóÇ æóÑóÏó ãóÂÁó ãóÏúíóäó æóÌóÏó Úóáóíúåö ÃõãøóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö íóÓúŞõæäó</div><br>  (And when he arrived at the water (a well) of Madyan he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 They are also the people of Al-Aykah (the Woods), as we will mention later on, Allah willing, and our trust is in Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó íóÇŞóæúãö ÇÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó ãóÇ áóßõãú ãøöäú ÅöáóÜåò ÛóíúÑõåõ</div><br>  (He said: "O my people!

He then advised them and commanded them to give full measure and full weight and not to wrong men in their dealings, meaning, to refrain from cheating people in buying and selling. They used to treacherously avoid giving full weight and measure.
