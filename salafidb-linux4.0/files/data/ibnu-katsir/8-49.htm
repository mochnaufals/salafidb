When Abu Jahl was told that the caravan escaped safely, so they should return to Makkah, he commented, "No, by Allah! We will not go back until we proceed to the well of Badr, slaughter camels, drink alcohol and female singers sing to us. This way, the Arabs will always talk about our stance and what we did on that day.'' However, all of this came back to haunt Abu Jahl, because when they proceeded to the well of Badr, they brought themselves to death; and in the aftermath of Badr, they were thrown in the well of Badr, dead, disgraced, humiliated, despised and miserable in an everlasting, eternal torment. This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÈöãóÇ íóÚúãóáõæäó ãõÍöíØñ</div><br>  (and Allah is Muhit (encompassing and thoroughly comprehending) all that they do.) He knows how and what they came for, and this is why He made them taste the worst punishment. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóßõæäõæÇú ßóÇáøóĞöíäó ÎóÑóÌõæÇú ãöä ÏöíóÜÑöåöã ÈóØóÑÇğ æóÑöÆóÂÁó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (And be not like those who come out of their homes boastfully and to be seen of men,) "They were the idolators who fought against the Messenger of Allah at Badr.''

Shaytan, may Allah curse him, made the idolators' purpose for marching seem fair to them. He made them think that no other people could defeat them that day. He also ruled out the possibility that their enemies, the tribe of Bani Bakr, would attack Makkah, saying, "I am your neighbor.'' Shaytan appeared to them in the shape of Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju`shum, the chief of Bani Mudlij, so that, as Allah described them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚöÏõåõãú æóíõãóäøöíåöãú æóãóÇ íóÚöÏõåõãú ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ ÅöáÇøó ÛõÑõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (He Shaytan makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan's promises are nothing but deceptions)4:120.  Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah, (8:48) "On the day of Badr, Shaytan, as well as, his flag holder and soldiers, accompanied the idolators. He whispered to the hearts of the idolators, `None can defeat you today! I am your neighbor.'

When the two armies stood face to face, the Messenger of Allah took a handful of sand and threw it at the faces of the idolators, causing them to retreat. Jibril, peace be upon him, came towards Shaytan, but when Shaytan, while holding the hand of a Mushrik man, saw him, he withdrew his hand and ran away with his soldiers. That man asked him, `O Suraqah! You claimed that you are our neighbor' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöí ÃóÑóì ãóÇ áÇó ÊóÑóæúäó Åöäøöí ÃóÎóÇİõ Çááøóåó æóÇááøóåõ ÔóÏöíÏõ ÇáúÚöŞóÇÈö</div><br>  (Verily, I see what you see not.

Qatadah commented, "They saw a group of believers who came in defense of Allah's religion. We were informed that when he saw Muhammad and his Companions, Abu Jahl said, `By Allah! After this day, they will never worship Allah!' He said this in viciousness and transgression.'' `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, "Some people from Makkah were considering embracing Islam, but when they went with the idolators to Badr and saw how few the Muslims were, they said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÛóÑøó åóÜÄõáÇÁö Ïöíäõåõãú</div><br>  (These people (Muslims) are deceived by their religion.)
