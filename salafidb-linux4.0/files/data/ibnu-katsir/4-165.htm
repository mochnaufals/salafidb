The following are the names of the Prophets whom Allah named in the Qur'an. They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh (Noah), Hud, Salih, Ibrahim (Abraham), Lut, Isma`il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya`qub (Jacob), Yusuf (Joesph), Ayyub (Job), Shu`ayb, Musa (Moses), Harun (Aaron), Yunus (Jonah), Dawud (David), Sulayman (Solomon), Ilyas (Elias), Al-Yasa` (Elisha), Zakariya (Zachariya), Yahya (John) and `Isa (Jesus), and their leader, Muhammad . Several scholars of Tafsir also listed Dhul-Kifl among the Prophets.

This is an honor to Musa, and this is why he is called the Kalim, he whom Allah spoke to directly. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah recorded that `Abdul-Jabbar bin `Abdullah said, "A man came to Abu Bakr bin `Ayyash and said, `I heard a man recite (this Ayah this way): æóßóáøóãó Çááøóåó ãõæÓóì ÊóßáöíãğÇ "and to Allah, Musa spoke directly.'' Abu Bakr said, `Only a disbeliever would recite it like this.' Al-A`mash recited it with Yahya bin Withab, who recited it with Abu `Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami who recited it with `Ali bin Abi Talib who recited with the Messenger of Allah ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóáøóãó Çááøóåõ ãõæÓóì ÊóßúáöíãÇğ</div><br>  (and to Musa Allah spoke directly.)''' Abu Bakr bin Abi Ayyash was so angry with the man who recited the Ayah differently, because he altered its words and meanings. That person was from the group of Mu`tazilah who denied that Allah spoke to Musa or that He speaks to any of His creation. We were told that some of the Mu`tazilah once recited the Ayah that way, so one teacher present said to him, "O son of a stinking woman! What would you do concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁó ãõæÓóì áöãöíŞóÜÊöäóÇ æóßóáøóãóåõ ÑóÈøõåõ</div><br>  (And when Musa came at the time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord spoke to him,) 7:143'' The Shaykh meant that the later Ayah cannot be altered or changed. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reason Behind Sending the Prophets is to Establish the Proof</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøõÓõáÇğ ãøõÈóÔøöÑöíäó æóãõäĞöÑöíäó</div><br>  (Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning,) meaning, the Prophets bring good news to those who obey Allah and practice the good things that please Him. They also warn against His punishment and torment for those who defy His commandments. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöÆóáÇøó íóßõæäó áöáäøóÇÓö Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÍõÌøóÉñ ÈóÚúÏó ÇáÑøõÓõáö æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÚóÒöíÒÇğ ÍóßöíãÇğ</div><br>  (in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.) Allah sent down His Books and sent His Messengers with good news and warnings. He explained what He likes and is pleased with and what He dislikes and is displeased with. This way, no one will have an excuse with Allah.
