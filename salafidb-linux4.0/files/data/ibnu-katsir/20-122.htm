Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away'') (121. Then they both ate of the Tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. Thus Adam disobeyd his Lord, so he went astray.) (122.

Mujahid and Al-Hasan said that he forgot means, "He abandoned it.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ŞõáúäóÇ áöáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö ÇÓúÌõÏõæÇú áÇøğÏóãó</div><br>  (And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam.'') He, Allah mentions how Adam was honored and what respect was given to him. He mentions how He favored him over many of those whom He created. A discussion of this story has already preceded in Surat Al-Baqarah, Surat Al-A`raf, Surat Al-Hijr and Surat Al-Kahf. It will also be mentioned again at the end of Surah Sad. In this story, Allah mentions the creation of Adam and that He commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam as a sign of honor and respect. He also explains the enmity of Iblis for the Children of Adam and for their father, Adam, before them. Due to this Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóÌóÏõæÇú ÅöáÇøó ÅöÈúáöíÓó ÃóÈóì</div><br>  (They prostrated themselves (all) except Iblis; he refused.) This means that he refrained from prostrating and became arrogant.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞõáúäóÇ íÜóÇÏóãõ Åöäøó åóÜĞóÇ ÚóÏõæøñ áøóßó æóáöÒóæúÌößó</div><br>  (Then We said: "O Adam!

But here, in Paradise, you live a life of ease with no burdens and no difficulties.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó áóßó ÃóáÇøó ÊóÌõæÚó İöíåóÇ æóáÇó ÊóÚúÑóì </div><br>  (Verily, you will never be hungry therein nor naked.) The reason that Allah combined hunger and nakedness is because hunger is internal humiliation, while nakedness is external humiliation.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóßó áÇó ÊóÙúãóÄõÇ İöíåóÇ æóáÇó ÊóÖúÍóì </div><br>  (And you (will) suffer not from thirst therein nor from the sun's heat.) These two characteristics are also opposites. Thirst is the internal heat and being parched from lack of water, while the suns heat is the external heat.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóæóÓúæóÓó Åöáóíúåö ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ ŞóÇáó íÜóÇÏóãõ åóáú ÃóÏõáøõßó Úóáóì ÔóÌóÑóÉö ÇáúÎõáúÏö æóãõáúßò áÇøó íóÈúáóì </div><br>  (Then Shaytan whispered to him, saying: "O Adam!

However, Iblis did not cease prodding them until they both had eaten from it. It was the Tree of Eternity (Shajarat Al-Khuld). This meant that anyone who ate from it would live forever and always remain. A Hadith has been narrated which mentions this Tree of Eternity. Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÔóÌóÑóÉğ íóÓöíÑõ ÇáÑøóÇßöÈõ İöí ÙöáøöåóÇ ãöÇÆóÉó ÚóÇãò ãóÇ íóŞúØóÚõåóÇ¡ æóåöíó ÔóÌóÑóÉõ ÇáúÎõáúÏ»</div><br>  (Verily, in Paradise there is a tree which a rider can travel under its shade for one hundred years and still not have passed it. It is the Tree of Eternity.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this narration. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóßóáÇó ãöäúåóÇ İóÈóÏóÊú áóåõãóÇ ÓóæúÁóÊõåõãóÇ</div><br>  (Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ubayy bin Ka`b said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÎóáóŞó ÂÏóãó ÑóÌõáğÇ ØõæóÇáğÇ ßóËöíÑó ÔóÚúÑö ÇáÑøóÃúÓö¡ ßóÃóäøóåõ äóÎúáóÉõ ÓóÍõæŞò¡İóáóãøóÇ ĞóÇŞó ÇáÔøóÌóÑóÉó ÓóŞóØó Úóäúåõ áöÈóÇÓõåõ¡ İóÃóæøóáõ ãóÇ ÈóÏóÇ ãöäúåõ ÚóæúÑóÊõåõ¡ İóáóãøóÇ äóÙóÑó Åöáóì ÚóæúÑóÊöåö ÌóÚóáó íóÔúÊóÏøõ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ İóÃóÎóĞóÊú ÔóÚúÑóåõ ÔóÌóÑóÉñ İóäóÇÒóÚóåóÇ¡ İóäóÇÏóÇåõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóäõ: íóÇ ÂÏóãõ ãöäøöí ÊóİöÑøõ¡ İóáóãøóÇ ÓóãöÚó ßóáóÇãó ÇáÑøóÍúãóäö ŞóÇáó: íóÇ ÑóÈøö áóÇ¡ æóáóßöäö ÇÓúÊöÍúíóÇÁğ¡ ÃóÑóÃóíúÊó Åöäú ÊõÈúÊõ æóÑóÌóÚúÊõ ÃóÚóÇÆöÏöí Åöáóì ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¿ ŞóÇáó: äóÚóã»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah created Adam as a tall man with an abundance of hair on his head. He looked like a clothed palm tree. Then, when he tasted (the fruit of) the tree, his clothes fell off of him. The first thing that became exposed was his private parts. So when he noticed his nakedness, he tried to run back into Paradise. However, in the process a tree caught hold of his hair (i.e. his hair was tangled in a tree), so he ripped his hair out. Then, the Most Beneficent called out to him saying, "O Adam, are you fleeing from me'' When he heard the Words of the Most Beneficent, he said, "No my Lord, but I am ashamed. If I repent and recant would You let me return to Paradise'' Allah replied, "Yes.'') This is the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóáóŞøóì ÁóÇÏóãõ ãöä ÑøóÈøöåö ßóáöãóÇÊò İóÊóÇÈó Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  a(Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him.) 2:37 However, this narration has a break in the chain of transmission between Al-Hasan and Ubayy bin Ka`b. Al-Hasan did not hear this Hadith from Ubayy. It is questionable as to whether this narration can be correctly attributed to the Prophet . Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóØóİöŞóÇ íóÎúÕöİóÇäö ÚóáóíúåöãóÇ ãöä æóÑóŞö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö</div><br>  (And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. ) Mujahid said, "They patched the leaves on themselves in the form of a garment.'' Qatadah and As-Suddi both said the same.

Adam replied, "Are you the one whom Allah chose for His Divine Messages and His direct Speech Are you blaming me for a matter that Allah wrote upon me before He created me'') Then, the Messenger of Allah said, (Thus, Adam defeated Musa.)
