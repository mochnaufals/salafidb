He, the Exalted and Most Honored, will decide who will be thrown into the Fire and she will keep saying, "Are there any more,'' or, `Are there any more whom You will provide me with' This is the apparent meaning of this Ayah which is supported by several Hadiths.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÒóÇáõ Ìóåóäøóãõ íõáúŞóì İöíåóÇ æóÊóŞõæáõ: åóáú ãöäú ãóÒöíÏò¿ ÍóÊúì íóÖóÚó ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚöÒøóÉö ŞóÏóãóåõ İöíåóÇ¡ İóíóäúÒóæöí ÈóÚúÖõåóÇ Åöáóì ÈóÚúÖò æóÊóŞõæáõ: ŞóØú ŞóØú æóÚöÒøóÊößó æóßóÑóãößó. æóáóÇ íóÒóÇáõ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö İóÖúáñ ÍóÊúì íõäúÔöìÁó Çááåõ áóåóÇ ÎóáúŞğÇ ÂÎóÑó İóíõÓúßöäóåõãõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì İöí İõÖõæáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (The people will be thrown into Jahannam and it will say, `Are there any more' Until the Mighty Lord puts His Foot over it and its corners will be collected together and it will say, "Enough, enough by Your grace and compassion!' There will be sufficient empty space in Paradise until Allah creates another creation and He, the Exalted, makes them dwell in the empty parts of Paradise.)'' Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõŞóÇáõ áöÌóåóäøóãó åóáö ÇãúÊóáóÃúÊö¿ æóÊóŞõæáõ: åóáú ãöäú ãóÒöíÏò¿ İóíóÖóÚõ ÇáÑøóÈøõ ÊóÈóÇÑóßó æóÊóÚóÇáóì ŞóÏóãóåõ ÚóáóíúåóÇ İóÊóŞõæáõ: ŞóØú ŞóØ»</div><br>  (Jahannam will be asked, "Are you full'' and it will say, "Are there any more'' Until the Lord, the Blessed and Most Honored, puts His Foot over it and it will say: "Enough!

The Fire said, "I have been favored with the arrogant people and tyrants.'' Paradise said, "What is wrong with me that only the poor and humble people enter me'' Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said to Paradise, "You are My mercy, with which I grant mercy to those whom I will among My servants.'' He said to Hell, "You are My punishment which I inflict upon whom I wish from My servants, and I shall fill both of you.'' As for Hellfire, it will not have its fill until Allah puts His Foot over it and she will say, "Enough! Enough!'' She will become full and its sides will come close to each other. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored shall not be unjust to any one of His creatures. As for Paradise, Allah the Exalted and Most Honored will create another creation to fill it.) Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõÒúáöİóÊö ÇáúÌóäøóÉõ áöáúãõÊøóŞöíäó ÛóíúÑó ÈóÚöíÏò </div><br>  (And Paradise will be Uzlifat to those who had Taqwa, not far off.) meaning, Paradise will be brought close and near to the pious, according to Qatadah, Abu Malik and As-Suddi,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÛóíúÑó ÈóÚöíÏò</div><br>  (not far off), and this will occur on the Day of Resurrection, which is not far off.

Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÂÁó ÈöŞóáúÈò ãøõäöíÈò</div><br>  (and brought a heart turned in repentance. ) meaning, he will meet Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, on the Day of Resurrection with a heart turned in repentance to Him and absolutely free (of Shirk) and humbled to Him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÏúÎõáõæåóÇ</div><br>  (Enter you therein), meaning Paradise,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÓóáóÜãò</div><br>  (in peace and security), they will earn security from the torment of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, and the angels of Allah will greet them with the Salam, according to the explanation of Qatadah.
