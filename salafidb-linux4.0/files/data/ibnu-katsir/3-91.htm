He states that in this case, no repentance shall be accepted from them upon their death. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóíúÓóÊö ÇáÊøóæúÈóÉõ áöáøóĞöíäó íóÚúãóáõæäó ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÜÊö ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ÍóÖóÑó ÃóÍóÏóåõãõ ÇáúãóæúÊõ</div><br>  (And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them) 4:18.

And they are those who went astray.) to those who abandon the path of truth for the path of wickedness. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that some people embraced Islam, reverted to disbelief, became Muslims again, then reverted from Islam. They sent their people inquiring about this matter and they asked the Messenger of Allah . On that, this Ayah was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÈóÚúÏó ÅöíãóÜäöåöãú Ëõãøó ÇÒúÏóÇÏõæÇú ßõİúÑğÇ áøóä ÊõŞúÈóáó ÊóæúÈóÊõåõãú</div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieved after their belief and then went on increasing in their disbelief never will their repentance be accepted). The chain of narration is satisfactory. Thereafter, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóãóÇÊõæÇú æóåõãú ßõİøóÇÑñ İóáóä íõŞúÈóáó ãöäú ÃóÍóÏöåöã ãøöáúÁõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ĞóåóÈğÇ æóáóæö ÇİúÊóÏóì Èöåö</div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them even if they offered it as a ransom.)  Those who die while disbelievers, shall have no good deed ever accepted from them, even if they spent the earth's fill of gold in what was perceived to be an act of obedience. The Prophet was asked about `Abdullah bin Jud`an, who used to be generous to guests, helpful to the indebted and who gave food (to the poor); will all that benefit him The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ¡ Åöäøóåõ áóãú íóŞõáú íóæúãğÇ ãöäó ÇáÏøóåúÑö: ÑóÈøö ÇÛúİöÑ áöí ÎóØöíÆóÊöí íóæúãó ÇáÏøöíä»</div><br>  (No, for not even one day during his life did he pronounce, `O my Lord! Forgive my sins on the Day of Judgment.)  Similarly, if the disbeliever gave the earth's full of gold as ransom, it will not be accepted from him. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõŞúÈóáõ ãöäúåóÇ ÚóÏúáñ æóáÇó ÊóäİóÚõåóÇ ÔóİóÜÚóÉñ</div><br>  (...nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use to him,)2:123, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó ÈóíúÚñ İöíåö æóáÇó ÎöáóÜáñ</div><br>  (...on which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.) 14:31, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú áóæú Ãóäøó áóåõãú ãøóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÌóãöíÚÇğ æóãöËúáóåõ ãóÚóåõ áöíóİúÊóÏõæÇú Èöåö ãöäú ÚóĞóÇÈö íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö ãóÇ ÊõŞõÈøöáó ãöäúåõãú æóáóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ </div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby from the torment on the Day of Resurrection, it would never be accepted of them, and theirs would be a painful torment) 5:36.  This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóãóÇÊõæÇú æóåõãú ßõİøóÇÑñ İóáóä íõŞúÈóáó ãöäú ÃóÍóÏöåöã ãøöáúÁõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ĞóåóÈğÇ æóáóæö ÇİúÊóÏóì Èöåö</div><br>  ,(Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them if they offered it as a ransom).  The implication of this Ayah is that the disbeliever shall never avoid the torment of Allah, even if he spent the earth's fill of gold, or if he ransoms himself with the earth's fill of gold, - all of its mountains, hills, sand, dust, valleys, forests, land and sea.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÄúÊóì ÈöÇáÑøóÌõáö ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö İóíóŞõæáõ áóåõ: íóÇ ÇÈúäó ÂÏóãó¡ ßóíúİó æóÌóÏúÊó ãóäúÒöáóßó¿ İóíóŞõæáõ: Ãóíú ÑóÈøö ÎóíúÑó ãóäúÒöáò¡ İóíóŞõæáõ: Óóáú æóÊóãóäøó¡ İóíóŞõæáõ: ãóÇ ÃóÓúÃóáõ æóáóÇ ÃóÊóãóäøóì ÅöáøóÇ Ãóäú ÊóÑõÏøóäöí Åöáóì ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ İóÃõŞúÊóáó İöí ÓóÈöíáößó ÚóÔúÑó ãöÑóÇÑò¡ áöãóÇ íóÑóì ãöäú İóÖúáö ÇáÔøóåóÇÏóÉö¡ æóíõÄúÊóì ÈöÇáÑøóÌõáö ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáäøóÇÑö İóíóŞõæáõ áóåõ: íóÇ ÇÈúäó ÂÏóãó¡ ßóíúİó æóÌóÏúÊó ãóäúÒöáóßó¿ İóíóŞõæáõ: íóÇ ÑóÈøö ÔóÑøó ãóäúÒöáò¡ İóíóŞõæáõ áóåõ: ÊóİúÊóÏöí ãöäøöí ÈöØöáóÇÚö ÇáúÃóÑúÖö ĞóåóÈğÇ¿ İóíóŞõæáõ: Ãóíú ÑóÈøö äóÚóãú¡ İóíóŞõæáõ: ßóĞóÈúÊó¡ ŞóÏú ÓóÃóáúÊõßó ÃóŞóáøó ãöäú Ğóáößó æóÃóíúÓóÑó İóáóãú ÊóİúÚóáú¡ İóíõÑóÏøõ Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (A man from among the people of Paradise will be brought and Allah will ask him, "O son of Adam!

A man from among the people of the Fire will be brought, and Allah will say to him, "O son of Adam! How do you find your dwelling'' He will say, "It is the worst dwelling, O Lord.'' Allah will ask him, "Would you ransom yourself from Me with the earth's fill of gold'' He will say, "Yes, O Lord.'' Allah will say, "You have lied.
