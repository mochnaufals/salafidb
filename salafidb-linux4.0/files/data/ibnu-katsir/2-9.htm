Nifaq has several types: Nifaq in the creed that causes its people to reside in Hell for eternity, and Nifaq in deed, which is one of the major sins, as we will explain soon, Allah willing. Ibn Jurayj said of the hypocrite that, "His actual deeds are different from what he publicizes, what he conceals is different from what he utters, his entrance and presence are not the same as his exit and absence.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Beginning of Hypocrisy</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The revelations about the characteristics of the hypocrites were revealed in Al-Madinah, this is because there were no hypocrites in Makkah. Rather the opposite was the situation in Makkah, since some people were forced to pretend that they were disbelievers, while their hearts concealed their faith. Afterwards, the Messenger of Allah migrated to Al-Madinah, where the Ansar from the tribes of Aws and Khazraj resided. They used to worship idols during the pre-Islamic period of ignorance, just as the rest of the Arab idolators. Three Jewish tribes resided in Al-Madinah, Banu Qaynuqa`-allies of Al-Khazraj, Banu An-Nadir and Banu Qurayzah-allies of the Aws. Many members of the Aws and Khazraj tribes embraced Islam. However, only a few Jews embraced Islam, such as `Abdullah bin Salam. During the early stage in Al-Madinah, there weren't any hypocrites because the Muslims were not strong enough to be feared yet. On the contrary, the Messenger of Allah conducted peace treaties with the Jews and several other Arab tribes around Al-Madinah. Soon after, the battle of Badr occurred and Allah gave victory to Islam and its people. `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul was a leader in Al-Madinah. He was Al-Khazraj's chief, and during the period of Jahiliyyah he was the master of both tribes - Aws and Khazraj. They were about to appoint him their king when the Message reached Al-Madinah, and many in Al-Madinah embraced Islam. Ibn Salul's heart was filled with hatred against Islam and its people. When the battle of Badr took place, he said, "Allah's religion has become apparent.'' So he pretended to be Muslim, along with many of those who were just like him, as well as many among the People of the Book. It was then that hypocrisy began in Al-Madinah and among the surrounding nomad tribes. As for the Emigrants, none of them were hypocrites, since they emigrated willingly (seeking the pleasure of Allah). Rather, when a Muslim would emigrate from Makkah, he would be forced to abandon all of his wealth, offspring and land; he would do so seeking Allah's reward in the Hereafter. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Tafsir of Ayah 2:8</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íóŞõæáõ ÁóÇãóäøóÇ ÈöÇááøóåö æóÈöÇáúíóæúãö ÇáÃúÎöÑö æóãóÇ åõã ÈöãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (And of mankind, there are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day'' while in fact they do not believe) "This refers to the hypocrites among the Aws and Khazraj and those who behaved as they did.''  This is how Abu Al-`Aliyah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and As-Suddi explained this Ayah. Allah revealed the characteristics of the hypocrites, so that the believers would not be deceived by their outer appearance, thus saving the believers from a great evil. Otherwise, the believers might think that the hypocrites were believers, when in reality they are disbelievers. To consider the sinners as righteous people is extremely dangerous, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íóŞõæáõ ÁóÇãóäøóÇ ÈöÇááøóåö æóÈöÇáúíóæúãö ÇáÃúÎöÑö æóãóÇ åõã ÈöãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (And of mankind, there are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day'' while in fact they do not believe) meaning, they utter these false statements only with their tongues, just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóßó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞõæäó ŞóÇáõæÇú äóÔúåóÏõ Åöäøóßó áóÑóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö æóÇááøóåõ íóÚúáóãõ Åöäøóßó áóÑóÓõæáõåõ</div><br>  (When the hypocrites come to you (O Muhammad ), they say: "We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah.'' Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger) (63:1).  This Ayah means that the hypocrites utter these statements only when they meet you, not because they actually believe what they are saying. The hypocrites emphasize their belief in Allah and the Last Day with their words, when that is not the case in reality. Therefore, Allah stated that the hypocrites lie in their testimony of creed, when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóÔúåóÏõ Åöäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó áóßóÜĞöÈõæäó</div><br>  (And Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars.) (63:1), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ åõã ÈöãõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  (while in fact they believe not)  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÎóÜÏöÚõæäó Çááøóåó æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇ</div><br>  (They try to deceive Allah and those who believe). The hypocrites show belief outwardly while concealing disbelief. They think that by doing this, they will mislead Allah, or that the statements they utter will help them with Allah, and this is an indication of their total ignorance. They think that such behavior will deceive Allah, just as it might deceive some of the believers. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÈúÚóËõåõãõ Çááøóåö ÌóãöíÚÇğ İóíóÍúáöİõæäó áóåõ ßóãóÇ íóÍúáöİõæäó áóßõãú æóíóÍúÓóÈõæäó Ãóäøóåõãú Úóáóì ÔóìúÁò ÃóáÇó Åöäøóåõãú åõãõ ÇáúßóÜĞöÈõæäó </div><br>  (On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you. And they think that they have something (to stand upon). Verily, they are liars!) (58:18). aHence, Allah refuted their way by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÎúÏóÚõæäó ÅáÇøó ÃóäİõÓóåõãú æóãóÇ íóÔúÚõÑõæäó</div><br>  (While they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not!) Allah stated that the hypocrites only deceive themselves by this behavior, although they are unaware of this fact. Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó íõÎóÜÏöÚõæäó Çááøóåó æóåõæó ÎóÇÏöÚõåõãú</div><br>  (Verily, the hypocrites try to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them) (4:142).  Also, Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Ibn Jurayj commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó íõÎóÜÏöÚõæäó Çááøóåó æóåõæó ÎóÇÏöÚõåõãú</div><br>  (Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them), "The hypocrites pronounce, `There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah' seeking to ensure the sanctity of their blood and money, all the while concealing disbelief.''Sa`id said that Qatadah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íóŞõæáõ ÁóÇãóäøóÇ ÈöÇááøóåö æóÈöÇáúíóæúãö ÇáÃúÎöÑö æóãóÇ åõã ÈöãõÄúãöäöíäó - íõÎóÜÏöÚõæäó Çááøóåó æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇ æóãóÇ íóÎúÏóÚõæäó ÅáÇøó ÃóäİõÓóåõãú æóãóÇ íóÔúÚõÑõæäó </div><br>  (And of mankind, there are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last Day'' while in fact they believe not. They try to deceive Allah and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not!) "This is the description of a hypocrite. He is devious, he says the truth with his tongue and defies it with his heart and deeds. He wakes up in a condition other than the one he goes to sleep in, and goes to sleep in a different condition than the one he wakes up in. He changes his mind just like a ship that moves about whenever a wind blows.''  </div></body></html>
