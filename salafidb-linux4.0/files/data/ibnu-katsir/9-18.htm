Those who read the Ayah, "Masjid Allah'', said that it refers to Al-Masjid Al-Haram, the most honored Masjid on the earth, which was built, from the first day, for the purpose of worshipping Allah alone without partners. It was built by Khalil Ar-Rahman (the Prophet Ibrahim) peace be upon him. The idolators do this while they themselves testify to their disbelief with their statements and actions. As-Suddi said, "If you ask a Christian, `What is your religion', He will tell you he is a Christian. If you ask a Jew about his religion, he will say he is a Jew, and the same for a Sabi' and a Mushrik!'''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÍóÈöØóÊú ÃóÚúãóÜáõåõãú</div><br>  (The works of such are in vain), because of their Shirk,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİöì ÇáäøóÇÑö åõãú ÎóÜáöÏõæäó</div><br>  (and in Fire shall they abide.)
