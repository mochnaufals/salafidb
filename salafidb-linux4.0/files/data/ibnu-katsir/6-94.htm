There are many Hadiths, of Mutawatir grade, that explain what occurs when the believers and disbelievers die, and we will mention these Hadiths when explaining Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõËóÈøöÊõ Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÈöÇáúŞóæúáö ÇáËøóÇÈöÊö İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóİöì ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö</div><br>  (Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world, and in the Hereafter.) 14:27 Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÌöÆúÊõãõæäóÇ İõÑóÇÏóì ßóãóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÜßõãú Ãóæøóáó ãóÑøóÉò</div><br>  (And truly you have come unto Us alone as We created you the first time.) 6:94, and this statement will be said on the Day of Return.

But, what part of your money do you have, other than what you eat of it and is thus spent, what you wear and tear and what you gave in chairty and thus remains (in the record of good deeds) Other than that, you will depart and leave it to the people.) Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "On the Day of Resurrection, the Son of Adam will be brought, as if he were a golden chariot and Allah, the Most Honored, will ask, `Where is what you collected' He will reply, `O Lord! I collected it and left it as intact as ever.' Allah will say to him, `O Son of Adam! Where is what you sent forth for yourself (of righteous, good deeds),' and he will realize that he did not send forth anything for himself.''

This chastises and criticizes the disbelievers for the rivals, idols and images that they worshipped in this life, thinking they will avail them in this life and upon Resurrection, if there is Resurrection, as they thought. On the Day of Resurrection, all relationships will be cut off, misguidance will be exposed, and those whom they used to call upon as gods will disappear from them. Allah will then call them, while the rest of creation is listening,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóíúäó ÔõÑóßóÂÆöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßõäÊõãú ÊóÒúÚõãõæäó</div><br>  (Where are My (so-called) partners whom you used to assert) 28:62 And,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞöíáó áóåõãú Ãóíúäó ãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó - ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö åóáú íóäÕõÑõæäóßõãú Ãóæú íóäÊóÕöÑõæäó </div><br>  (And it will be said to them: "Where are those that you used to worship.
