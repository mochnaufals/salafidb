They will have Jannatu `Adn. `Adn means lasting.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåöãõ ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ</div><br>  (wherein rivers flow beneath them,) means, from beneath its rooms and dwellings. Fir`awn said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóÜĞöåö ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöì</div><br>  (and these rivers flowing beneath me...) 43:51   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÍóáøóæúäó</div><br>  (they will be adorned) means, with jewelry.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåóÇ ãöäú ÃóÓóÇæöÑó ãöä ĞóåóÈò</div><br>  (with bracelets of gold,) Allah says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáõÄúáõÄÇğ æóáöÈóÇÓõåõãú İöíåóÇ ÍóÑöíÑñ</div><br>  (and pearls and their garments therein will be of silk) 22:23. This is explained in more detail here, where Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóáúÈóÓõæäó ËöíóÇÈğÇ ÎõÖúÑğÇ ãøöä ÓõäúÏõÓò æóÅöÓúÊóÈúÑóŞò</div><br>  (and they will wear green garments of Sundus and Istabraq.) Sundus refers to a fine garment, like a shirt and the like, and Istabraq is thick and shiny velvet.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõÊøóßöÆöíäó İöíåóÇ Úóáóì ÇáÇøñÑóÇÆößö</div><br>  (They will be Muttaki'in therein on Ara'ik.) The word Muttaki'in implies lying down, or it was said that it means sitting with one's legs crossed, which is closer to the meaning here. In a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãøóÇ ÃóäóÇ İóáóÇ Âßõáõ ãõÊøóßöÆğÇ»</div><br>  (As for me, I do not eat sitting with legs crossed (Muttaki'an)). Ara'ik is the plural of Arikah, which is a bed under a canopy. And Allah knows best.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äöÚúãó ÇáËøóæóÇÈõ æóÍóÓõäóÊú ãõÑúÊóİóŞÇğ</div><br>  (How good is the reward, and what an excellent place of rest (Murtafaq)!) means, how blessed is Paradise as a reward for their good deeds. And what an excellent Murtafaq means, and how good a place to dwell and rest and stay. Previously, Allah had said of Hell,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÆúÓó ÇáÔøóÑóÇÈõ æóÓóÂÁóÊú ãõÑúÊóİóŞğÇ</div><br>  (Terrible is the drink, and an evil place of rest (Murtafaq)!) 18:29. In a similar way, He contrasts the two (Paradise and Hell) in Surat Al-Furqan, where He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóåóÇ ÓóÂÁóÊú ãõÓúÊóŞóÑøÇğ æóãõŞóÇãÇğ </div><br>  (Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.) 25:66. Then He mentions the qualities of the believers, then says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó íõÌúÒóæúäó ÇáúÛõÑúİóÉó ÈöãóÇ ÕóÈóÑõæÇú æóíõáóŞøóæúäó İöíåóÇ ÊóÍöíøóÉğ æóÓóáóÜãÇğ - ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÇ ÍóÓõäóÊú ãõÓúÊóŞóÑøÇğ æóãõŞóÇãÇğ </div><br>  (Those will be rewarded with the highest place because of their patience. Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect. Abiding therein excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.) 25:75-76  </div></body></html>
