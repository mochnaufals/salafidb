So he will have no answer on the Day of Resurrection except to remain silent, because whoever is blind in this world (i.e., does not see Allah's signs and believes not in Him), will be blind in the Hereafter, and more astray.

Mujahid said: "The proof will be obscured from them,'' so they will not be able to ask one another for help by virtue of their blood ties. Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóãøóÇ ãóä ÊóÇÈó æóÁóÇãóäó æóÚóãöáó ÕóÜáöÍÇğ</div><br>  (But as for him who repented, believed, and did righteous deeds,) means, in this world.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÚóÓóì Ãóä íóßõæäó ãöäó ÇáúãõİúáöÍöíäó</div><br>  (then perhaps he will be among those who are successful.) means, on the Day of Resurrection. And the word; perhaps (`Asa), when used in reference to Allah, may He be exalted, implies that the thing described will inevitably come to pass, and this will undoubtedly happen by the grace and mercy of Allah.  </div></body></html>
