If you want us to believe in you, ask your Lord to turn As-Safa' into gold for us.' Allah conveyed to him by inspiration (Wahy): `I have heard what they have said. If you wish, I will do what they say, but if they do not believe after that, the punishment will come down upon them, because after the sign has been sent, there is no room for speculation. Or if you wish, I will be patient with your people and give them more time.' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇÑóÈøö ÇÓúÊóÃúäö Èöåöã»</div><br>  (O Lord, give them more time.)'' This was also narrated by Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj and others. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "The people of Makkah asked the Prophet to turn As-Safa' into gold for them, and to remove the mountains (from around Makkah) so that they could cultivate the land. It was said to him (by Allah): `If you wish, I will be patient and give them more time, or if you wish, I will do what they are asking, but if they then disbelieve, they will be destroyed as the nations before them were destroyed.' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ¡ Èóáö ÇÓúÊóÃúäö Èöåöã»</div><br>  (No, be patient and give them more time.) Then Allah revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ãóäóÚóäóÂ Ãóä äøõÑúÓöáó ÈöÇáÇøñíóÜÊö ÅöáÇøó Ãóä ßóĞøóÈó ÈöåóÇ ÇáÇøñæøóáõæäó</div><br>  (And nothing stops Us from sending the Ayat but that the people of old denied them. ) An-Nasa'i also reported this from the Hadith of Jarir. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said: The Quraysh said to the Prophet , "Ask your Lord to turn As-Safa' into gold and we will believe in you.'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÊóİúÚóáõæäó¿»</div><br>  (Will you really do that) They said, "Yes.'' So he asked his Lord, and Jibril came to him and said: "Your Lord conveys His Salam to you and says, `If you wish, I will turn As-Safa' into gold for them, then whoever of them disbelieves after that, will be punished with a torment the like of which has never be seen in creation; or if you wish, I will open the gates of repentance and mercy for them.''' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Èóáú ÈóÇÈõ ÇáÊøóæúÈóÉö æóÇáÑøóÍúãóÉ»</div><br>  (Rather the gates of repentance and mercy.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ äõÑúÓöáõ ÈöÇáÇøñíóÜÊö ÅöáÇøó ÊóÎúæöíİğÇ</div><br>  (And We sent not the signs except to make them afraid (of destruction).) Qatadah said, "Allah makes people afraid with whatever signs He wills, so that they may learn a lesson and remember and return to Him. We were told that Al-Kufah was shaken at the time of Ibn Mas`ud, who said: `O people, your Lord is rebuking you, so pay heed!''' Similarly, it was reported that Al-Madinah was struck by several earthquakes at the time of `Umar bin Al-Khattab. `Umar said: "You have changed, by Allah, and if such a quake were to strike again, I will subject you to such and such.'' The Prophet said, in a Hadith whose authenticity is agreed upon:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÔøóãúÓó æóÇáúŞóãóÑó ÂíóÊóÇäö ãöäú ÂíóÇÊö Çááåö æóÅöäøóåõãóÇ áóÇ íóäúßóÓöİóÇäö áöãóæúÊö ÃóÍóÏò æóáóÇ áöÍóíóÇÊöåö¡ æóáóßöäøó Çááåó ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó íõÎóæøöİõ ÈöåöãóÇ ÚöÈóÇÏóåõ¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóíúÊõãú Ğóáößó İóÇİúÒóÚõæÇ Åöáóì ĞößúÑöåö æóÏõÚóÇÆöåö æóÇÓúÊöÛúİóÇÑöåö Ëõãøó ŞóÇáó: íóÇ ÃõãøóÉó ãõÍóãøóÏò æóÇááåö ãóÇ ÃóÍóÏñ ÃóÛúíóÑó ãöäó Çááåö Ãóäú íóÒúäöíó ÚóÈúÏõåõ Ãóæú ÊóÒúäöíó ÃóãóÊõåõ¡ íóÇ ÃõãøóÉó ãõÍóãøóÏò æóÇááåö áóæú ÊóÚúáóãõæäó ãóÇ ÃóÚúáóãõ áóÖóÍößúÊõãú ŞóáöíáğÇ æóáóÈóßóíúÊõãú ßóËöíÑğÇ»</div><br>  (The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah, and they are not eclipsed for the death or life of anyone. Allah uses them to make His servants afraid, so if you see them, hasten to remember Him, call on Him and seek His forgiveness.) Then he said: (O Ummah of Muhammad, by Allah, no one has a greater sense of jealousy than Allah if He sees His servant, or female servant, committing Zina (illegal sexual intercourse). O Ummah of Muhammad, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much.)  </div></body></html>
