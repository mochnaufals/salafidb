Hence, if you claim that what he was sent with did not come from Allah, then produce something similar to what he has brought to you, using the help of anyone you wish instead of Allah. However, you will not be able to succeed in this quest. Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÔõåóÏóÂÁóßõãõ</div><br>  (your witnesses) means "Aids.'' Also, As-Suddi reported that Abu Malik said the Ayah means, "Your partners, meaning, some other people to help you in that. Meaning then go and seek the help of your deities to support and aid you.'' Also, Mujahid said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÏúÚõæÇú ÔõåóÏóÂÁóßõã</div><br>  (and call your witnesses) means, "People, meaning, wise and eloquent men who will provide the testimony that you seek.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Challenge</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah challenged the disbelievers in various parts of the Qur'an. For instance, Allah said in Surat Al-Qasas (28:49),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú İóÃúÊõæÇú ÈößöÊóÜÈò ãøöäú ÚöäÏö Çááøóåö åõæó ÃóåúÏóì ãöäúåõãóÂ ÃóÊøóÈöÚúåõ Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó </div><br>  (Say (to them, O Muhammad ): "Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two (the Tawrah (Torah) and the Qur'an), that I may follow it, if you are truthful''). Also, Allah said in Surat Al-Isra' (17:88),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõá áøóÆöäö ÇÌúÊóãóÚóÊö ÇáÅöäÓõ æóÇáúÌöäøõ Úóáóì Ãóä íóÃúÊõæÇú ÈöãöËúáö åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäö áÇó íóÃúÊõæäó ÈöãöËúáöåö æóáóæú ßóÇäó ÈóÚúÖõåõãú áöÈóÚúÖò ÙóåöíÑğÇ </div><br>  (Say: "If mankind and the Jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.'') Allah said in Surat Hud (11:13),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú íóŞõæáõæäó ÇİúÊóÑóÇåõ Şõáú İóÃúÊõæÇú ÈöÚóÔúÑö ÓõæóÑò ãøöËúáöåö ãõİúÊóÑóíóÇÊò æóÇÏúÚõæÇú ãóäö ÇÓúÊóØóÚúÊõãú ãøöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó </div><br>  (Or they say, "He (Prophet Muhammad ) forged it (the Qur'an).'' Say: "Bring you then ten forged Surahs (chapters) like it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the truth!''), and in Surat Yunus (10:37-38),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäõ Ãóä íõİúÊóÑóì ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö æóáóÜßöä ÊóÕúÏöíŞó ÇáøóĞöì Èóíúäó íóÏóíúåö æóÊóİúÕöíáó ÇáúßöÊóÇÈö áÇó ÑóíúÈó İöíåö ãöä ÑøóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó - Ãóãú íóŞõæáõæäó ÇİúÊóÑóÇåõ Şõáú İóÃúÊõæÇú ÈöÓõæÑóÉò ãøöËúáöåö æóÇÏúÚõæÇú ãóäö ÇÓúÊóØóÚúÊõãú ãøöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó </div><br>  (And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allah (Lord of the heavens and the earth), but it is a confirmation of (the revelation) which was before it (i.e. the Tawrah, and the Injil), and a full explanation of the Book (i.e. Laws decreed for mankind) Ü wherein there is no doubt Ü from the Lord of all that exists.) (Or do they say: "He (Muhammad ) has forged it'' Say: "Bring then a Surah (chapter) like it, and call upon whomsoever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!''). All of these Ayat were revealed in Makkah.  Allah also challenged the disbelievers in the Ayat that were revealed in Al-Madinah. In this Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ßõäÊõãú İöì ÑóíúÈò</div><br>  (And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in Rayb) meaning, doubt.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöãøóÇ äóÒøóáúäóÇ Úóáóì ÚóÈúÏöäóÇ</div><br>  (Concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our servant) meaning, Muhammad ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃúÊõæÇú ÈöÓõæÑóÉò ãøöä ãøöËúáöåö</div><br>  (then produce a Surah (chapter) the like thereof) meaning, similar to the Qur'an. This is the Tafsir of Mujahid, Qatadah, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari, Az-Zamakhshari and Ar-Razi. Ar-Razi said that this is the Tafsir of `Umar, Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and the majority of the scholars. And he gave preference to this view and mentioned the fact that Allah has challenged the disbelievers as individuals and as groups, whether literate or illiterate, thus making the challenge truly complete. This type of challenge is more daring than simply challenging the disbelievers who might not be literate or knowledgeable. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃúÊõæÇú ÈöÚóÔúÑö ÓõæóÑò ãøöËúáöåö</div><br>  (Bring you then ten forged Surahs (chapters) like it) (11:13), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÃúÊõæäó ÈöãöËúáöåö</div><br>  (They could not produce the like thereof) (17:88).  Therefore, this is a general challenge to the Arab disbelievers, the most eloquent among all nations. Allah challenged the Arab disbelievers both in Makkah and Al-Madinah several times, especially since they had tremendous hatred and enmity for the Prophet and his religion. Yet, they were unable to succeed in answering the challenge, and this is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä áøóãú ÊóİúÚóáõæÇú æóáóä ÊóİúÚóáõæÇú</div><br>  (But if you do it not, and you can never do it), indicating that they will never be able to answer the challenge. This is another miracle, in that, Allah clearly stated without doubt that the Qur'an will never be opposed or challenged by anything similar to it, for eternity. This is a true statement that has not been changed until the present and shall never change. How can anyone be able to produce something like the Qur'an, when the Qur'an is the Word of Allah Who created everything How can the words of the created ever be similar to the Words of the Creator <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Examples of the Miracle of the Qur'an</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Whoever reads through the Qur'an will realize that it contains various levels of superiority through both the apparent and hidden meanings that it mentions. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÑßöÊóÜÈóÃõÍúßöãóÊú ÁÇíóÜÊõåõ Ëõãøó İõÕøöáóÊú ãöä áøóÏõäú Íóßöíãò ÎóÈöíÑò</div><br>  (Alif Lam Ra. (This is) a Book, the verses whereof are perfect (in every sphere of knowledge, etc.), and then explained in detail from One (Allah), Who is Wise and well-acquainted (with all things)) (11:1)  So the expressions in the Qur'an are perfect and its meanings are explained. Further, every word and meaning in the Qur'an is eloquent and cannot be surpassed. The Qur'an also mentioned the stories of the people of the past; and these accounts and stories occurred exactly as the Qur'an stated. Also, the Qur'an commanded every type of righteousness and forbade every type of evil, just as Allah stated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóãøóÊú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó ÕöÏúŞÇğ æóÚóÏúáÇğ</div><br>  (And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice) (6:115). meaning, true in the stories it narrates and just in its Laws. The Qur'an is true, just and full of guidance. It does not contain exaggerations, lies or falsehood, unlike Arabic and other types of poems that contained lies. These poems, conform with the popular statement, "The most eloquent speech is the one that contains the most lies!'' Sometimes, one would find a long poem that mainly contains descriptions of women, horses or alcohol. Or, the poem might contain praise or the description of a certain person, horse, camel, war, incident, fear, lion, or other types of items and objects. Such praise or descriptions do not bring any benefit, except shed light on the poet's ability to clearly and eloquently describe such items. Yet, one will only be able to find one or two sentences in many long poems that elaborate on the main theme of the poem, while the rest of the poem contains insignificant descriptions and repetitions.  As for the Qur'an, it is entirely eloquent in the most perfect manner, as those who have knowledge in such matters and understand Arabic methods of speech and expressions concur. When one reads through the stories in the Qur'an, he will find them fruitful, whether they were in extended or short forms, repeated or not. The more these stories are repeated, the more fruitful and beautiful they become. The Qur'an does not become old when one repeats reciting it, nor do the scholars ever get bored with it. When the Qur'an mentions the subject of warning and promises, it presents truths that would make solid, firm mountains shake, so what about the comprehending, understanding hearts When the Qur'an promises, it opens the hearts and the ears, making them eager to attain the abode of peace - Paradise - and to be the neighbors of the Throne of the Most Beneficent. For instance, on the subject of promises and encouragement, the Qur'an said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóÚúáóãõ äóİúÓñ ãøóÂ ÃõÎúİöìó áóåõã ãøöä ŞõÑøóÉö ÃóÚúíõäò ÌóÒóÂÁğ ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do) (32:17), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİöíåóÇ ãóÇ ÊóÔúÊóåöíåö ÇáÇøñäúİõÓõ æóÊóáóĞøõ ÇáÇøñÚúíõäõ æóÃóäÊõãú İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó</div><br>  ((There will be) therein all that inner selves could desire, and all that eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever) (43:71).  On the subject of warning and discouragement;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÃóãöäÊõãú Ãóä íóÎúÓöİó Èößõãú ÌóÇäöÈó ÇáúÈóÑøö</div><br>  (Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a side of the land to swallow you up) (17:68), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁóãöäÊõãú ãøóä İöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö Ãóä íóÎúÓöİó Èößõãõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖó İóÅöĞóÇ åöìó ÊóãõæÑõ - Ãóãú ÃóãöäÊõãú ãøöä İöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö Ãóä íõÑúÓöáó Úóáóíúßõãú ÍóÜÕöÈÇğ İóÓóÊóÚúáóãõæäó ßóíúİó äóĞöíÑö </div><br>  (Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allah), will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allah), will not send against you a violent whirlwind Then you shall know how (terrible) has been My warning) (67:16-17).  On the subject of threats, the Qur'an said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßõáÇøğ ÃóÎóĞúäóÇ ÈöĞóäÈöåö</div><br>  (So We punished each (of them) for his sins) (29:40). Also, on the subject of soft advice, the Qur'an said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÑóÃóíúÊó Åöä ãøóÊøóÚúäóÜåõãú Óöäöíäó - Ëõãøó ÌóÂÁóåõã ãøóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íõæÚóÏõæäó - ãóÂ ÃóÛúäóì Úóäúåõãú ãøóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íõãóÊøóÚõæäó </div><br>  (Tell Me, (even) if We do let them enjoy for years. And afterwards comes to them that (punishment) which they had been promised. All that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them) (26:205-207).  There are many other examples of the eloquence, beauty, and benefits of the Qur'an.  When the Qur'an is discussing Laws, commandments and prohibitions, it commands every type of righteous, good, pleasing and beneficial act. It also forbids every type of evil, disliked and amoral act. Ibn Mas`ud and other scholars of the Salaf said, "When you hear what Allah said in the Qur'an, such as,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú</div><br>  (O you who believe!), then listen with full attention, for it either contains a type of righteousness that Allah is enjoining, or an evil that He is forbidding.'' For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÃúãõÑõåõã ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö æóíóäúåóÜåõãú Úóäö ÇáúãõäúßóÑö æóíõÍöáøõ áóåõãõ ÇáØøóíøöÈóÜÊö æóíõÍóÑøöãõ Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáúÎóÈóÜÆöËó æóíóÖóÚõ Úóäúåõãú ÅöÕúÑóåõãú æóÇáÇøñÛúáóÜáó ÇáøóÊöì ßóÇäóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (He (Muhammad ) commands them for Al-Ma`ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibat(i.e. all good and lawful things), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khaba'ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful things), he releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them) (7:157).  When the Ayat mention Resurrection and the horrors that will occur on that Day, and Paradise and the Fire and the joys and safe refuge that Allah prepared for His loyal friends, or torment and Hell for His enemies, these Ayat contain glad tidings or warnings. The Ayat then call to perform good deeds and avoid evil deeds, making the life of this world less favorable and the Hereafter more favorable. They also establish the correct methods and guide to Allah's straight path and just legislation, all the while ridding the hearts of the evil of the cursed devil. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Qur'an is the Greatest Miracle given to the Prophet</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The Two Sahihs record that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú äóÈöíó ãöäó ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁö ÅöáøóÇ ŞóÏú ÃõÚúØöíó ãöäó ÇáÂíóÇÊö ãóÇ Âãóäó Úóáóì ãöËúáöåö ÇáúÈóÔóÑõ¡ æóÅäøóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÇáøóĞöí ÃõæÊöíÊõå æóÍúíğÇ ÃóæúÍóÇåõ Çááåõ Åöáóíøó İóÃóÑúÌõæ Ãóäú Ãóßõæäó ÃóßúËóÑóåõãú ÊóÇÈöÚğÇ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (Every Prophet was given a miracle, the type of which brings mankind to faith. What I was given is a revelation that Allah sent down to me. Yet, I hope that I will have the most following on the Day of Resurrection.)  This is the wording narrated by Muslim. The Prophet stated that among the Prophets he was given a revelation, meaning, he was especially entrusted with the miraculous Qur'an that challenged mankind to produce something similar to it. As for the rest of the divinely revealed Books, they were not miraculous according to many scholars. Allah knows best. The Prophet was also aided with innumerable signs and indications that testify to the truth of his prophethood and what he was sent with, all thanks and praise is due to Allah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Meaning of `Stones</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÊøóŞõæÇú ÇáäøóÇÑó ÇáøóÊöì æóŞõæÏõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ æóÇáúÍöÌóÇÑóÉõ ÃõÚöÏøóÊú áöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (Then fear the Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers) (2:24).  `Fuel' is wood, or similar substances, used to start and feed a fire. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ÇáúŞóÜÓöØõæäó İóßóÇäõæÇú áöÌóåóäøóãó ÍóØóÈÇğ </div><br>  (And as for the Qasitun (disbelievers who deviated from the right path), they shall be firewood for Hell) (72:15), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßõãú æóãóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ÍóÕóÈõ Ìóåóäøóãó ÃóäÊõãú áóåóÇ æóÇÑöÏõæäó </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú ßóÇäó åóÜÄõáÇÁö ÁóÇáöåóÉğ ãøóÇ æóÑóÏõæåóÇ æóßõáøñ İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó </div><br>  (Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you enter it. Had these (idols) been alihah (gods), they would not have entered there (Hell), and all of them will abide therein) (21:98-99).  The stones mentioned here are the giant, rotten, black, sulfuric stones that become the hottest when heated, may Allah save us from this evil end. It was also reported that the stones mentioned here are the idols and rivals that were worshipped instead of Allah, just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßõãú æóãóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ÍóÕóÈõ Ìóåóäøóãó</div><br>  (Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah,are (but) fuel for Hell!) (21:28).  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõÚöÏøóÊú áöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (prepared for the disbelievers)  It appears most obvious that it refers to the Fire that is fueled by men and stones, and it also may refer to the stones themselves. There is no contradiction between these two views, because they are dependent upon each other. `Prepared' means, it is `kept' and will surely touch those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger . Ibn Ishaq narrated that Muhammad said that `Ikrimah or Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõÚöÏøóÊú áöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (prepared for the disbelievers),  "For those who embrace the disbelief that you (disbelievers) have embraced.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Jahannam (Hellfire) exists now</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Many of the Imams of the Sunnah used this Ayah to prove that the Fire exists now. This is because Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõÚöÏøóÊú</div><br>  (prepared) meaning, prepared and kept. There are many Hadiths on this subject. For instance, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóÍóÇÌøóÊö ÇáúÌóäøóÉõ æóÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (Paradise and the Fire had an argument..)  Also, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÓúÊóÃúĞóäóÊö ÇáäøóÇÑõ ÑóÈøóåóÇ İóŞóÇáóÊú: ÑóÈøö Ãóßóáó ÈóÚÖöí ÈóÚúÖğÇ İóÃĞöäó áóåóÇ ÈöäóİóÓóíúäö: äóİóÓò İöí ÇáÔøöÊóÇÁö æóäóİóÓò İöí ÇáÕøóíúİ»</div><br>  (The Fire sought the permission of her Lord. She said, 'O my Lord! Some parts of me consumed the other parts.' And Allah allowed her two periods to exhale, one in winter and one in summer.)  Also, there is a Hadith recorded from Ibn Mas`ud that the Companions heard the sound of a falling object. When they asked about it, the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóĞóÇ ÍóÌóÑñ ÃõáúŞöíó Èöåö ãöäú ÔóİöíÑö Ìóåóäøóãó ãõäúĞõ ÓóÈúÚöíäó ÓóäóÉğ¡ ÇáúÂäó æóÕóáó Åöáì ŞóÚúÑöåóÇ»</div><br>  (This is a stone that was thrown from the top of Jahannam seventy years ago, but only now reached its bottom.) This Hadith is in Sahih Muslim.  There are many Hadiths that are Mutawatir (narrated by many different chains of narrations) on this subject, such as the Hadiths about the eclipse prayer, the night of Isra' etc.  Allah's statements,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃúÊõæÇú ÈöÓõæÑóÉò ãøöä ãøöËúáöåö</div><br>  (Then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof) (2:23), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÓõæÑóÉò ãøöËúáöåö</div><br>  (A Surah (chapter) like it) (10:38) this includes the short and long Surahs of the Qur'an. Therefore, the challenge to creation stands with regards to both the long and short Surahs, and there is no disagreement that I know of on this fact between the scholars of old and new. Before he became Muslim, `Amr bin Al-`As met Musaylimah the Liar who asked him, "What has recently been revealed to your fellow (meaning Muhammad ) in Makkah'' `Amr said, "A short, yet eloquent Surah.'' He asked, "What is it'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÚóÕúÑö - Åöäøó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó áóİöì ÎõÓúÑò </div><br>  (By Al-`Asr (the time).
