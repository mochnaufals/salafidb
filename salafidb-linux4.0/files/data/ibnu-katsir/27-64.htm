Is not He Who originates creation, and shall thereafter repeat it, and Who provides for you from heaven and earth Is there any god with Allah Say: "Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful.'')  He is the One Who, by His might and power, originates creation and then repeats it. This is like the Ayat:</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÈóØúÔó ÑóÈøößó áóÔóÏöíÏñ - Åöäøóåõ åõæó íõÈúÏöìÁõ æóíõÚöíÏõ </div><br>  (Verily, the punishment of your Lord is severe and painful.

Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sends down water from the sky as a blessing, and causes it to penetrate the earth, and then come forth as springs. After that, by means of the water He brings forth all kinds of crops, fruits and flowers, in all their different forms and colors.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáõæÇú æóÇÑúÚóæúÇ ÃóäúÚóÜãóßõãú Åöäøó İöì Ğáößó áÃíóÜÊò áÇøñæúáöì Çáäøõåóì </div><br>  (Eat and pasture your cattle; verily, in this are signs for men of understanding) (20:54).

Produce the evidence of that. But it is known that they have no proof or evidence, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÏúÚõ ãóÚó Çááøóåö ÅöáóÜåóÇ ÁóÇÎóÑó áÇó ÈõÑúåóÇäó áóåõ Èöåö İóÅöäøóãóÇ ÍöÓóÇÈõåõ ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåö Åöäøóåõ áÇó íõİúáöÍõ ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó </div><br>  (And whoever invokes besides Allah, any other god, of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord.
