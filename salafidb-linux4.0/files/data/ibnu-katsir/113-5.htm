Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, "Al-Falaq is the morning.'' The same has been reported from Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Abdullah bin Muhammad bin `Aqil, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Ibn Zayd. Malik also reported a similar statement from Zayd bin Aslam. Al-Qurazi, Ibn Zayd and Ibn Jarir all said, "This is like Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇáöŞõ ÇáÅöÕúÈóÇÍö</div><br>  (He is the Cleaver of the daybreak.).'' (6:96) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ÔóÑøö ãóÇ ÎóáóŞó </div><br>  (From the evil of what He has created,) This means from the evil of all created things. Thabit Al-Bunani and Al-Hasan Al-Basri both said, "Hell, Iblis and his progeny, from among that which He (Allah) created.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ÔóÑøö ÛóÇÓöŞò ÅöĞóÇ æóŞóÈó </div><br>  (And from the evil of the Ghasiq when Waqab,) Mujahid said, "Ghasiq is the night, and `when it Waqab' refers to the setting of the sun.'' Al-Bukhari mentioned this from him. Ibn Abi Najih also reported a similar narration from him (Mujahid).  The same was said by Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Ad-Dahhak, Khusayf, Al-Hasan and Qatadah. They said, "Verily, it is the night when it advances with its darkness.'' Az-Zuhri said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ÔóÑøö ÛóÇÓöŞò ÅöĞóÇ æóŞóÈó </div><br>  (And from the evil of the Ghasiq when Waqab,) "This means the sun when it sets.'' Abu Al-Muhazzim reported that Abu Hurayrah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ÔóÑøö ÛóÇÓöŞò ÅöĞóÇ æóŞóÈó </div><br>  (And from the evil of the Ghasiq when Waqab, ) "This means the star.'' Ibn Zayd said, "The Arabs used to say, `Al-Ghasiq is the declination (of the position) of the heavenly body known as Pleiades. The number of those who were ill and stricken with plague would increase whenever it would decline, and their number would lessen whenever it rose.'''  Ibn Jarir said, "Others have said that it is the moon.''  The support for the people who hold this position (that it means the moon) is a narration that Imam Ahmad recorded from Al-Harith bin Abi Salamah. He said that `A'ishah said, "The Messenger of Allah took me by my hand and showed me the moon when it rose, and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóÚóæøóĞöí ÈöÇááåö ãöäú ÔóÑøö åóĞóÇ ÇáúÛóÇÓöŞö ÅöĞóÇ æóŞóÈó»</div><br>  (Seek refuge with Allah from the evil of this Ghasiq when it becomes dark.)'' At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i both recorded this Hadith in their Books of Tafsir in their Sunans. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ÔóÑøö ÇáäøóİøóÜËóÜÊö İöì ÇáúÚõŞóÏö </div><br>  (And from the evil of the blowers in knots,) Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak all said, "This means the witches.'' Mujahid said, "When they perform their spells and blow into the knots.''  In another Hadith it has been reported that Jibril came to the Prophet and said, "Are you suffering from any ailment, O Muhammad'' The Prophet replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú»</div><br>  (Yes.) So Jibril said, "In the Name of Allah, I recite prayer (Ruqyah) over you, from every illness that harms you, from the evil of every envious person and evil eye. May Allah cure you.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Discussion of the Bewitchment of the Prophet</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  In the Book of Medicine of his Sahih, Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah said, "The Messenger of Allah was bewitched until he thought that he had relations with his wives, but he had not had relations with them.'' Sufyan said, "This is the worst form of magic when it reaches this stage.'' So the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÚóÇÆöÔóÉõ¡ ÃóÚóáöãúÊö Ãóäøó Çááåó ŞóÏú ÃóİúÊóÇäöí İöíãóÇ ÇÓúÊóİúÊóíúÊõåõ İöíåö¿ ÃóÊóÇäöí ÑóÌõáóÇäö İóŞóÚóÏó ÃóÍóÏõåõãóÇ ÚöäúÏó ÑóÃúÓöí æóÇáúÇÎóÑõ ÚöäúÏó ÑöÌúáóíøó¡ İóŞóÇá ÇáøóĞöí ÚöäúÏó ÑóÃúÓöí áöáúÇÎóÑö: ãóÇ ÈóÇáõ ÇáÑøóÌõáö¿ ŞóÇáó: ãóØúÈõæÈñ¡ ŞóÇáó: æóãóäú ØóÈøóåõ¡ ŞóÇáó: áóÈöíÏõ Èúäõ ÃóÚúÕóãó: ÑóÌõáñ ãöäú Èóäöí ÒõÑóíúŞò Íóáöíİñ áöíóåõæÏó¡ ßóÇäó ãõäóÇİöŞğÇ¡ ŞóÇáó: æóİöíãó¿ ŞóÇáó: İöí ãõÔúØò æóãõÔóÇØóÉò¡ ŞóÇáó: æóÃóíúäó¿ ŞóÇáó: İöí Ìõİøö ØóáúÚóÉò ĞóßóÑò¡ ÊóÍúÊó ÑóÇÚõæİóÉò İöí ÈöÆúÑö ĞóÑúæóÇäó»</div><br>  (O `A'ishah! Do you know that Allah has answered me concerning that which I asked Him Two men came to me and one of them sat by my head while the other sat by my feet. The one who was sitting by my head said to the other one, `What is wrong with this man' The other replied, `He is bewitched.' The first one said, `Who bewitched him' The other replied, `Labid bin A`sam. He is a man from the tribe of Banu Zurayq who is an ally of the Jews, and a hypocrite.' The first one asked, `With what (did he bewitch him)' The other replied, `With a comb and hair from the comb.' The first one asked, `Where (is the comb)' The other answered, `In the dried bark of a male date palm under a rock in a well called Dharwan.') `A'ishah said, "So he went to the well to remove it (the comb with the hair).
