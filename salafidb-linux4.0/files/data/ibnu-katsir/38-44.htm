These tests afflicted his body, his wealth and his children, until there was no part of his body that was healthy except his heart. Then he had nothing left in this world which he could use to help him deal with his sickness or the predicament he was in, besides his wife, who retained her devotion to him because of her faith in Allah and His Messenger. She used to work for people as a paid servant, and she fed and served him (Ayyub) for nearly eighteen years. Before that, he was very rich and had many children, being well off in worldly terms. All of that had been taken away until he ended up being thrown into the city dump where he stayed all this time, shunned by relatives and strangers alike, with the exception of his wife -- may Allah be pleased with her. She did not leave him, morning and evening, except for when she was serving people, then she would come straight back to him. When this had gone on for a long time, and things had gotten very bad, and the time allotted by divine decree had come to an end, Ayyub prayed to the Lord of the worlds, the God of the Messengers, and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøöì ãóÓøóäöìó ÇáÖøõÑøõ æóÃóäÊó ÃóÑúÍóãõ ÇáÑøóÇÍöãöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, distress has seized me, and You are the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy.) (21:83). And according to this Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇĞúßõÑú ÚóÈúÏóäóÂ ÃóíøõæÈó ÅöĞú äóÇÏóì ÑóÈøóåõ Ãóäøöì ãóÓøóäöìó ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ ÈöäõÕúÈò æóÚóĞóÇÈò </div><br>  (And remember Our servant Ayyub, when he invoked his Lord (saying): "Verily, Shaytan has afflicted me with distress and torment!'') It was said that "distress'' referred to bodily afflictions and "torment'' referred to the loss of his wealth and children. Then the Most Merciful of those who show mercy responded to him, telling him to stand up and strike the ground with his foot. He did this, and Allah caused a spring of water to flow. He commanded him to wash in it, and all the pain and affliction in his body disappeared. Then He commanded him to strike the ground in a different place, and Allah caused another spring to flow, and Ayyub was commanded to drink from it. Then all his internal problems disappeared, and he became healthy again, inside and out.

They used to visit him every morning and every evening. One of them said to his companion, "You know, by Allah, that Ayyub committed a great sin which nobody in the world ever committed.'' His companion said, "Why are you saying that'' He said, "For eighteen years he has been suffering and Allah has not had mercy on him and relieve his suffering.'' When he went to him the next morning, the (second) man could not wait to tell this to Ayyub. Ayyub, peace be upon him, said, "I do not know what you are talking about, but Allah knows if I passed by two men who were arguing and they mentioned the Name of Allah, I would go back home and offer expiation lest they had mentioned the Name of Allah in an improper manner. '' Whenever he went out to answer the call of nature, when he finished, his wife would take his hand until he came back home. One day he took a long time, and Allah had revealed to Ayyub, (Strike the ground with your foot. This is (a spring of) water to wash in, cool and a (refreshing) drink.) She thought that he had taken too long, so she turned to look at him, and saw that Allah had taken away the afflictions he had been suffering, and he looked better than he had ever looked. When she saw him, she said, "May Allah bless you! Have you seen Allah's Prophet, the one who is sorely tested By Allah, I have never seen a man who looks more like him than you, if he were healthy.'' He said, "I am he.'' He had two threshing floors, one for wheat and one for barley. Allah sent two clouds, and when one of them reached the threshing floor of the wheat, it rained gold until it was full. The other rained gold on the threshing floor of the barley until it was full.) This is the wording of Ibn Jarir, may Allah have mercy on him. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóíúäóãóÇ ÃóíøõæÈõ íóÛúÊóÓöáõ ÚõÑúíóÇäğÇ ÎóÑøó Úóáóíúåö ÌóÑóÇÏñ ãöäú ĞóåóÈò İóÌóÚóáó ÃóíøõæÈõ Úóáóíúåö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉõ æóÇáÓøóáóÇãõ íóÍúËõæ İöí ËóæúÈöåö¡ İóäóÇÏóÇåõ ÑóÈøõåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó íóÇ ÃóíøõæÈõ¡ Ãóáóãú Ãóßõäú ÃóÛúäóíúÊõßó ÚóãøóÇ ÊóÑóì ŞóÇáó Úóáóíúåö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉõ æóÇáÓøóáóÇãõ: Èóáóì íóÇ ÑóÈøö¡ æóáóßöäú áóÇ Ûöäì Èöí Úóäú ÈóÑóßóÊöß»</div><br>  (While Ayyub was bathing naked, locusts of gold fell upon him.

Ayyub, peace be upon him, got angry with his wife and was upset about something she had done, so he swore an oath that if Allah healed him, he would strike her with one hundred blows. When Allah healed him, how could her service, mercy, compassion and kindness be repaid with a beating So Allah showed him a way out, which was to take a bundle of thin grass, with one hundred stems, and hit her with it once. Thus he fulfilled his oath and avoided breaking his vow. This was the solution and way out for one who had Taqwa of Allah and turned to Him in repentance.
