So they should beware of him and not follow in his footsteps. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÎóáóŞúäóÜßõãú Ëõãøó ÕóæøóÑúäóÜßõãú Ëõãøó ŞõáúäóÇ áöáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö ÇÓúÌõÏõæÇú áÃóÏóãó İóÓóÌóÏõæÇú</div><br>  (And surely, We created you and then gave you shape; then We told the angels, "Prostrate yourselves to Adam,'' and they prostrated,) This is like His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ŞóÇáó ÑóÈøõßó áöáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö Åöäøöì ÎóÜáöŞñ ÈóÔóÑğÇ ãøöä ÕóáúÕóÜáò ãøöäú ÍóãóÅò ãøóÓúäõæäò - İóÅöĞóÇ ÓóæøóíúÊõåõ æóäóİóÎúÊõ İöíåö ãöä ÑøõæÍöì İóŞóÚõæÇú áóåõ ÓóÜÌöÏöíäó </div><br>  (And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "I am going to create a man from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud. So, when I have fashioned him completely and breathed into him the soul (which I created for him), then fall (you) down prostrating yourselves unto him.'') 15:28-29. After Allah created Adam with His Hands from dried clay of altered mud and made him in the shape of a human being, He blew life into him and ordered the angels to prostrate before him, honoring Allah's glory and magnificence. The angels all heard, obeyed and prostrated, but Iblis did not prostrate. We explained this subject in the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah. Therefore, the Ayah (7:11) refers to Adam, although Allah used the plural in this case, because Adam is the father of all mankind. Similarly, Allah said to the Children of Israel who lived during the time of the Prophet ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÙóáøóáúäóÇ Úóáóíúßõãõ ÇáúÛóãóÇãó æóÃóäÒóáúäóÇ Úóáóíúßõãõ Çáúãóäøó æóÇáÓøóáúæóì</div><br>  (And We shaded you with clouds and sent down on you manna and the quail,)2:57 This refers to their forefathers who lived during the time of Moses. But, since that was a favor given to the forefathers, and they are their very source, then the offspring have also been favored by it. This is not the case in:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÅöäúÓóÜäó ãöä ÓõáóÜáóÉò ãøöä Øöíäò </div><br>  (And indeed We created man out of an extract of clay (water and earth.))23:12 For this merely means that Adam was created from clay. His children were created from Nutfah (mixed male and female sexual discharge). This last Ayah is thus talking about the origin of mankind, not that they were all created from clay, and Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
