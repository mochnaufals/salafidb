Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÍúíóíúäóÜåóÇ æóÃóÎúÑóÌúäóÇ ãöäúåóÇ ÍóÈøÇğ İóãöäúåõ íóÃúßõáõæäó</div><br>  (We give it life, and We bring forth from it grains, so that they eat thereof.) meaning, `We have made it a provision for them and their cattle.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöíåóÇ ÌóäøóÜÊò ãøöä äøóÎöíáò æóÃóÚúäóÜÈò æóİóÌøóÑúäóÇ İöíåóÇ ãöäó ÇáúÚõíõæäö </div><br>  (And We have made therein gardens of date palms and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein.) means, `We have created therein rivers which flow to the places where they are needed, so that they may eat of their fruits.' When Allah reminds them of the blessing that He bestows upon His creation by creating crops and plants, He mentions the different types and kinds of fruits. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÚóãöáóÊúåõ ÃóíúÏöíåöãú</div><br>  (and their hands made it not.) means, all of that could only come about by the mercy of Allah towards them, not by their own efforts and labor and strength. This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó íóÔúßõÑõæäó</div><br>  (Will they not then give thanks) meaning, will they not then give thanks for the innumerable blessings that He has bestowed upon them. Ibn Jarir, however, understood the word Ma to mean Alladhi (i.e., a relative pronoun). In this case the meaning of the Ayah would be that they eat from the fruits provided by Allah's bounty and from what their own hands have done, i.e., by planting the seeds and tending the plants. Ibn Jarir mentioned other possible interpretations in his Tafsir, but this is the interpretation that he favored. This interpretation also fits with the recitation of Ibn Mas`ud: (áöíóÃúßõáõæÇ ãöäú ËóãóÑöåö æóãöãøóÇ ÚóãöáóÊúåõ ÃóíúÏöíåöãú ÃóİóáóÇ íóÔúßõÑõæäó)  (So that they may eat of the fruit thereof -- and from what their own hands have done.) Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓõÈúÍóÜäó ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞ ÇáÇøñÒúæóÌó ßõáøóåóÇ ãöãøóÇ ÊõäÈöÊõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ</div><br>  (Glory be to Him Who has created all the pairs of that which the earth produces,) meaning, of crops and fruits and plants.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäú ÃóäİõÓöåöãú</div><br>  (as well as of their own (human) kind, ) means, He made them into male and female.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöãøóÇ áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (and of that which they know not.) means, different kinds of creatures of which they know nothing. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÒóæúÌóíúäö áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó </div><br>  (And of everything We have created pairs, that you may remember.)
