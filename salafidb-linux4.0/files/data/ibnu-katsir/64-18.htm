Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó Êõáúåößõãú Ãóãúæóáõßõãú æóáÇó ÃóæúáóÜÏõßõãú Úóä ĞößúÑö Çááøóåö æóãóä íóİúÚóáú Ğóáößó İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÎóÜÓöÑõæäó </div><br>  (O you who believe! Let not your properties or you children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And whosoever does that then they are the losers.) (63:9) Allah the Exalted said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÍúĞóÑõæåõãú</div><br>  (therefore, beware of them!) for your religion, according to Ibn Zayd. Mujahid explained the Ayah ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ãöäú ÃóÒúæóÌößõãú æóÃóæúáÜÏößõãú ÚóÏõæøÇğ áøóßõãú</div><br>  (Verily, among your wives and your children there are enemies for you;) by saying, "They might direct the man to sever his relation or disobey his Lord. The man, who loves his wives and children, might obey them in this case.'' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said to a man who asked him about this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú Åöäøó ãöäú ÃóÒúæóÌößõãú æóÃóæúáÜÏößõãú ÚóÏõæøÇğ áøóßõãú İóÇÍúĞóÑõæåõãú</div><br>  (O you who believe! Verily, among your wives and your children there are enemies for you; therefore beware of them!) "There were men who embraced Islam in Makkah and wanted to migrate to Allah's Messenger . However, their wives and children refused to allow them. Later when they joined Allah's Messenger , they found that those who were with him (the Companions) have gained knowledge in the religion, so they were about to punish their wives and children. Allah the Exalted sent down this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÊóÚúİõæÇú æóÊóÕúİóÍõæÇú æóÊóÛúİöÑõæÇú İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (But if you pardon (them) and overlook, and forgive, then verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)'' At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said that it is Hasan Sahih. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÂ Ãóãúæóáõßõãú æóÃóæúáóÜÏõßõãú İöÊúäóÉñ æóÇááøóåõ ÚöäúÏóåõ ÃóÌúÑñ ÚóÙöíãñ </div><br>  (Your wealth and your children are only a Fintah, whereas Allah! With Him is a great reward.) Allah said that the wealth and children are a test and trial from Allah the Exalted for His creatures, so that He knows those who obey Him and those who disobey Him. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÚöäúÏóåõ</div><br>  (whereas Allah! With Him) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÌúÑñ ÚóÙöíãñ</div><br>  (is a great reward.) As Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Òõíøöäó áöáäøóÇÓö ÍõÈøõ ÇáÔøóåóæóÊö ãöäó ÇáäøöÓóÂÁö æóÇáúÈóäöíäó æóÇáúŞóäóÜØöíÑö ÇáúãõŞóäØóÑóÉö ãöäó ÇáĞøóåóÈö æóÇáúİöÖøóÉö æóÇáúÎóíúáö ÇáúãõÓóæøóãóÉö æóÇáÃóäúÚóÜãö æóÇáúÍóÑúËö Ğóáößó ãóÊóÜÚõ ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÇááøóåõ ÚöäÏóåõ ÍõÓúäõ ÇáúãóÃóÈö </div><br>  (Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women children, Qanatir Al-Muqantarah of gold and silver, branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present world's life; but Allah has the excellent return with him.) (3:14), and the Ayah after it. Imam Ahmad recorded that Buraydah said, "The Messenger of Allah was giving a speech and Al-Hasan and Husayn came in wearing red shirts, walking and tripping. The Messenger descended from the Minbar, held them and placed them in front of them and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÕóÏóŞó Çááåõ æóÑóÓõæáõåõ ÅöäøóãóÇ ÃóãúæóÇáõßõãú æóÃóæúáóÇÏõßõãú İöÊúäóÉñ¡ äóÙóÑúÊõ Åöáóì åóĞóíúäö ÇáÕøóÈöíøóíúäö íóãúÔöíóÇäö æóíóÚúËõÑóÇäö¡ İóáóãú ÃóÕúÈöÑú ÍóÊúì ŞóØóÚúÊõ ÍóÏöíËöí æóÑóİóÚúÊõåõãóÇ»</div><br>  (Allah and His Messenger said the truth,`Verily, your wealth and your children are a Fitnah.' I saw these two boys walking and tripping and could not be patient until I stopped my speech and picked them up.)'' This was recorded by the Sunan compilers, and At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Gharib.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Order for Taqwa, as much as One is Capable</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó ãóÇ ÇÓúÊóØóÚúÊõãú</div><br>  (So have Taqwa of Allah as much as you can;) meaning, as much as you are able and can bear or endure. The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÃóãóÑúÊõßõãú ÈöÃóãúÑò İóÇÆúÊõæÇ ãöäúåõ ãóÇ ÇÓúÊóØóÚúÊõãú¡ æóãóÇ äóåóíúÊõßõãú Úóäúåõ İóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæå»</div><br>  (When I command you to do something, do as much as you can of it, and whatever I forbid for you, then avoid it.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúãóÚõæÇú æóÃóØöíÚõæÇú</div><br>  (listen and obey,) means, obey what Allah and His Messenger command you to do and do not stray from it to the right or left. Do not utter a statement or make a decision before Allah and His Messenger issue a statement or decision. Do not ignore what you were ordered to do, nor commit what you were forbidden from doing. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Encouraging Charity</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäúİöŞõæÇú ÎóíúÑÇğ áÇøğäİõÓößõãú</div><br>  (and spend in charity; that is better for yourselves.) meaning, give from what Allah has granted you to your relatives, the poor, the needy and the weak. Be kind to Allah's creatures, just as Allah was and still is kind with you. This will be better for you in this life and the Hereafter. Otherwise, if you do not do it, it will be worse for you in this life and the Hereafter. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõæŞó ÔõÍøó äóİúÓöåö İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúãõİúáöÍõæäó</div><br>  (And whosoever is saved from his own greed, then they are the successful ones.) This was explained with a similar Ayah in Surat Al-Hashr, where we also mentioned the relevant Hadiths. Therefore, we do not need to repeat them here, all praise and gratitude is due to Allah. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊõŞúÑöÖõæÇú Çááøóåó ŞóÑúÖÇğ ÍóÓóäÇğ íõÖóÜÚöİúåõ áóßõãú æóíóÛúİöÑú áóßõãú</div><br>  (If you lend to Allah a handsome loan, He will double it for you, and will forgive you.) meaning, whatever you spend, then Allah will replace it, and on Him will be the reward of whatever you give away in charity. Allah considered giving charity as if it is a loan to Him, just as Allah said in a Qudsi Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú íõŞúÑöÖõ ÛóíúÑó Ùóáõæãò æóáóÇ ÚóÏöíã»</div><br>  ("Who will give a loan to He Who is neither unjust nor poor'') This is why Allah the Exalted said in Surat Al-Baqarah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíõÖóÇÚöİóåõ áóåõ ÃóÖúÚóÇİğÇ ßóËöíÑóÉğ</div><br>  (So that He may multiply it to him many times) (2:245) Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÛúİöÑú áóßõãú</div><br>  (and will forgive you.) meaning, He will erase your mistakes,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÔóßõæÑñ</div><br>  (And Allah is Shakur) meaning, He gives abundantly in return for what was little,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Íóáöíãñ</div><br>  (Halim) means, He forgives, pardons, covers and absolves the sins, mistakes, errors and shortcomings,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÜáöãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÇáÔøóåóÜÏóÉö ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÍóßöíãõ </div><br>  (All-Knower of the unseen and seen, the Almighty, the All-Wise.) Its explanation has already preceded several times. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Taghabun, all the praise and appreciation is due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
