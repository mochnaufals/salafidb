Surely, nothing will busy Allah from attending to anything else.'' This type of speech pattern is common in the Arabic language. For example, one would say, "I will attend to you,'' even when one is not busy with anything else. Allah's saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáËøóŞóáÇóäö</div><br>  (O you Thaqalan!) refers to the humans and the Jinns, as in the Hadith;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÓúãóÚõåóÇ ßõáøõ ÔóíúÁò ÅöáøóÇ ÇáËøóŞóáóíúä»</div><br>  (Everyone will be able to hear it, except the Thaqalayn.) In another narration that explains it, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöáøóÇ ÇáúÅöäúÓó æóÇáúÌöä»</div><br>  (...except mankind and the Jinns.)

If you are able to pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, then pass beyond (them)! But you will never be able to pass them, except with authority (from Allah)!) meaning, `you will never be able to escape Allah's orders and decrees, because it encompasses you. You will never be able to avoid or avert His rule and judgement over you, you are surrounded by it wherever you may be.' This is also about the Gathering when the angels, comprising seven lines in every direction, will surround the creatures. None of the creatures will be able to escape on that Day,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÈöÓõáúØóÜäò</div><br>  (except with authority) meaning, except with the commandment from Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ íóæúãóÆöĞò Ãóíúäó ÇáúãóİóÑøõ - ßóáÇøó áÇó æóÒóÑó - Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó íóæúãóÆöĞò ÇáúãõÓúÊóŞóÑøõ </div><br>  (On that Day man will say: "Where (is the refuge) to flee'' No!

Abu Salih said, "It is the flame above the fire below the smoke.'' Ad-Dahhak said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÔõæóÇÙñ ãøöä äøóÇÑò</div><br>  (Shuwaz of fire) "A flood of fire.'' Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõÍóÇÓñ</div><br>  (and Nuhas) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas; "The smoke of the fire.'' Similar was reported from Abu Salih, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Abu Sinan. Ibn Jarir said that the Arabs used to call the smoke of the fire, Nuhas and Nihas. But he said that the scholars of Qur'anic recitation said that in this Ayah, the word recited is Nuhas. Mujahid said, "Molten brass poured over their heads.'' Qatadah held the same view. Ad-Dahhak said,"Nuhas is liquid copper.'' The Ayah means, `if you, mankind and the Jinns, try to escape on the Day of Resurrection, then the angels, including those among them who guard Hellfire, will bring you back by directing smoke of fire and molten brass on you.'
