And who have faith in what is revealed to you and in what was revealed before you, and in the Hereafter they are certain.)</div>  Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúßó æóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó ãöä ŞóÈúáößó</div><br>  (And who have faith in what is revealed to you and in what was revealed before you.) means, "They believe in what Allah sent you with, and in what the previous Messengers were sent with, they do not distinguish between (believing) them, nor do they reject what they brought from their Lord.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈöÇáÃúÎöÑóÉö åõãú íõæŞöäõæäó</div><br>  (And in the Hereafter they are certain) that is the resurrection, the standing (on the Day of Resurrection), Paradise, the Fire, the reckoning and the the Scale that weighs the deeds (the Mizan). The Hereafter is so named because it comes after this earthly life. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Attributes of the Believers</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The people described here (2:4) are those whom Allah described in the preceding Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö æóíõŞöíãõæäó ÇáÕøóáæÉó æóãöãøóÇ ÑóÒóŞúäóÜåõãú íõäİöŞõæäó </div><br>  (Those who have faith in the Ghayb and perform Salah, and spend out of what we have provided for them.)  Mujahid once stated, "Four Ayat at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah describe the believers, two describe the disbelievers, and thirteen describe the hypocrites.'' The four Ayat mentioned in this statement are general and include every believer, whether an Arab, non-Arab, or a person of a previous Scripture, whether they are Jinns or humans. All of these attributes complement each other and require the existence of the other attributes. For instance, it is not possible that one believes in the Unseen, performs the prayer and gives Zakah without believing in what the Messenger of Allah and the previous Messengers were sent with. The same with certainty in the Hereafter, this is not correct without that, for Allah has commanded the believers,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÁóÇãöäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö æóÑóÓõæáöåö æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈö ÇáøóĞöì äóÒøóáó Úóáóì ÑóÓõæáöåö æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈö ÇáøóĞöì ÃóäóÒáó ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (O you who believe!

Also, Allah the Exalted described the believers;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÁóÇãóäó ÇáÑøóÓõæáõ ÈöãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúåö ãöä ÑøóÈøöåö æóÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó ßõáøñ ÁóÇãóäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóãóáóÜÆößóÊöåö æóßõÊõÈöåö æóÑõÓõáöåö áÇó äõİóÑøöŞõ Èóíúäó ÃóÍóÏò ãøöä ÑøõÓõáöåö</div><br>  (The Messenger (Muhammad ) believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) "We make no distinction between any of His Messengers'') (2: 285), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö æóÑõÓõáöåö æóáóãú íõİóÑøöŞõæÇú Èóíúäó ÃóÍóÏò ãøöäúåõãú</div><br>  (And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them (Messengers)) (4:152),  This is a sample of the Ayat that indicate that the true believers all believe in Allah, His Messengers and His Books.  The faithful among the People of the Book, have a special significance here, since they believe in their Books and in all of the details related to that, so when such people embrace Islam and sincerely believe in the details of the religion, then they will get two rewards. As for the others, they can only believe in the previous religious teachings in a general way. For instance, the Prophet stated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÍóÏóËóßõãú Ãóåúáõ ÇáúßöÊóÇÈö İóáóÇ ÊõßóĞøöÈõæåõãú æóáóÇ ÊõÕóÏöŞõæåõãú æóáßöäú ŞõæáõæÇ: ÂãóäøóÇ ÈöÇáøóĞöí ÃõäúÒöáó ÅöáóíúäóÇ æóÃõäúÒöáó Åöáóíúßõã»</div><br>  (When the People of the Book narrate to you, neither reject nor affirm what they say. Rather, say, 'We believe in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to you.')  However, the faith that many Arabs have in the religion of Islam as it was revealed to Muhammad might be more complete, encompassing and firmer than the faith of the People of the Book who embraced Islam. Therefore, if the believers in Islam among the People of the Book gain two rewards, other Muslims who have firmer Islamic faith might gain an equal reward that compares to the two the People of the Book gain (upon embracing Islam). And Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
