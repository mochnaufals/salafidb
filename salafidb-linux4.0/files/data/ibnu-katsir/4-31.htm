Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on a man who buys a garment, saying that if he likes it he will keep it, or he will return it along with an extra Dirham, "This is what Allah meant, when He said, o   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÃúßõáõæÇú Ãóãúæóáóßõãú Èóíúäóßõã ÈöÇáúÈóÇØöáö</div><br>  (Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly.'') `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "When Allah sent down,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó ÊóÃúßõáõæÇú Ãóãúæóáóßõãú Èóíúäóßõãú ÈöÇáúÈóÜØöáö</div><br>  (O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly) some Muslims said, `Allah has forbidden us from eating up each other's property unjustly, and food is our best property. Therefore, none among us is allowed to eat from anyone else's food.' After that Allah sent down,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíúÓó Úóáóì ÇáÇøñÚúãóì ÍóÑóÌñ</div><br>  (There is no restriction on the blind) (until the end of the Ayah). 24:61.'''  Qatadah said similarly.

However, there is no harm in commercial transactions that transpire between the buyer and the seller with mutual consent, so that money is legally earned from these transactions. Mujahid said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Ãóä Êóßõæäó ÊöÌóÜÑóÉğ Úóä ÊóÑóÇÖò ãøöäúßõãú</div><br>  (except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent.) means, "By selling and buying, or giving someone a gift.'' Ibn Jarir recorded this statement. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Option to Buy or Sell Before Parting, is Part of `Mutual Consent' in Trading</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Mutual agreement in various transactions is attained when both parties have the right to uphold or dissolve the agreement before they part. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÈóíøöÚóÇäö ÈöÇáúÎöíóÇÑö ãóÇáóãú íóÊóİóÑøóŞóÇ»</div><br>  (The seller and the buyer retain the (right to change their mind) as long as they have not parted.)

Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Al-`As said that when the Prophet sent him for the battle of Dhat As-Salasil, "I had a wet dream during a very cold night and feared that if I bathed, I would die. So I performed Tayammum (with pure earth) and led my company in the Dawn prayer. When I went back to the Messenger of Allah , I mentioned what had happened to me and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÚóãúÑõæ ÕóáøóíúÊó ÈöÃóÕúÍóÇÈößó æóÃóäúÊó ÌõäõÈ»</div><br>  (O `Amr!

Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you). So I performed Tayammum and prayed.' The Messenger of Allah smiled and did not say anything.'' This is the narration reported by Abu Dawud. Ibn Marduwyah mentioned this honorable Ayah and then reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ŞóÊóáó äóİúÓóåõ ÈóÍóÏöíÏóÉò¡ İóÍóÏöíÏóÊõåõ İöí íóÏöåö¡ íóÌóÃõ ÈöåóÇ ÈØúäóåõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö İöí äóÇÑö Ìóåóäøóãó¡ ÎóÇáöÏğÇ ãõÎóáøóÏğÇ İöíåóÇ ÃóÈóÏğÇ¡ æãóäú ŞóÊóáó äóİúÓóåõ ÈöÓõãó İóÓõãøõåõ İöí íóÏöåö¡ íóÊóÍóÓøóÇåõ İöí äóÇÑö Ìóåóäøóãó¡ ÎóÇáöÏğÇ ãõÎóáøóÏğÇ İöíåóÇ ÃóÈóÏğÇ¡ æóãóäú ÊóÑóÏøóì ãöäú ÌóÈóáò İóŞóÊáó äóİúÓóåõ¡ İóåõæó ãõÊóÑóÏó İöí äóÇÑö Ìóåóäøóãó¡ ÎóÇáöÏğÇ ãõÎóáøóÏğÇ İöíåóÇ ÃóÈóÏğÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever kills himself with an iron tool, then his tool will be in his hand and he will keep stabbing himself with it in the Fire of Jahannam, forever and ever. Whoever kills himself with poison, then his poison will be in his hand and he will keep taking it in the Fire of Jahannam forever and ever. Whoever kills himself by throwing himself from a mountain, will keep falling in the Fire of Jahannam forever and ever.) This Hadith was also collected in the Two Sahihs. Abu Qilabah said that Thabit bin Ad-Dahhak said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ŞóÊóáó äóİúÓóåõ ÈöÔóíúÁò¡ ÚõĞøöÈó Èöåö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (Whoever kills himself with an instrument, will be punished with it on the Day of Resurrection.) This Hadith was collected by the Group. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóİúÚóáú Ğáößó ÚõÏúæóäÇğ æóÙõáúãÇğ</div><br>  (And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, ) meaning, whoever commits what Allah has forbidden for him transgression and injustice - while knowing that it is forbidden for him, yet he still dares to commit it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó äõÕúáöíåö äóÇÑÇğ</div><br>  (We shall cast him into the Fire,). This Ayah carries a stern warning and a truthful promise. Therefore, every sane person should beware of it, those who hear the speech with full comprehension. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Minor Sins Will be Pardoned if One Refrains from Major Sins</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊóÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ßóÈóÂÆöÑó ãóÇ Êõäåóæúäó Úóäúåõ äõßóİøöÑú Úóäúßõãú ÓóíøöÆóÜÊößõãú</div><br>  (If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall remit from you your (small) sins,) meaning, if you avoid the major evil deeds that you were prohibited We will forgive you the minor evil deeds and will admit you into Paradise.

There are several Hadiths on the subject of this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Salman Al-Farisi said, "The Prophet said to me, `Do you know what the day of Al-Jumu`ah is' I said, `It is the day during which Allah brought together the creation of your father (Adam).' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áßöäú ÃóÏúÑöí ãóÇ íóæúãõ ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö¡ áóÇ íóÊóØóåøóÑõ ÇáÑøóÌõáõ İóíõÍúÓöäõ ØõåõæÑóåõ¡ Ëõãøó íóÃúÊöí ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉó İóíõäúÕöÊõ ÍóÊøóì íóŞúÖöíó ÇáúÅãóÇãõ ÕóáóÇÊóåõ¡ ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇäó ßóİøóÇÑóÉğ áóåõ ãóÇ Èóíúäóåõ æóÈóíúäó ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö ÇáúãõŞúÈöáóÉö¡ ãóÇ ÇÌúÊõäöÈóÊö ÇáúãóŞúÊóáóÉ»</div><br>  (I know what the day of Jumu`ah is. Anyone who takes a bath and cleans himself as much as he can and then proceeds for the Friday prayer and remains quiet until the Imam finishes the prayer, all his sins in between the present and the next Friday will be forgiven, as long as major sins were avoided.)''  Al-Bukhari recorded similar wording from Salman Al-Farisi. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Seven Destructive Sins</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  What are the Seven Destructive Sins In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇ ÇáÓøóÈúÚó ÇáúãõæÈöŞóÇÊ»</div><br>  (Avoid the seven great destructive sins.)

Another Hadith that mentions False Witness Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said, "The Messenger of Allah mentioned the major sins, or was asked about the major sins. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÔøöÑúßõ ÈöÇááåö¡ æóŞóÊúáõ ÇáäøóİúÓö¡ æóÚõŞõæŞõ ÇáúæóÇáöÏóíúä»</div><br>  (Associating others with Allah in worship, killing the life, and being undutiful to the parents.)

Shu`bah - one of the narrators of the Hadith - said, "Most likely, in my opinion, he said, `False testimony.''' The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith from Shu`bah from Anas. Another Hadith In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakrah said that his father said, "The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ÃõäóÈøöÆõßõãú ÈöÃóßúÈóÑö ÇáúßóÈóÇÆöÑö¿»</div><br>  (Should I inform you about the greatest of the great sins) We said, `Yes, O Allah's Messenger !'

Another Hadith that mentions killing the Offspring In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! What is the greatest sin' (in one narration) the biggest sin' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóäú ÊóÌúÚóáó ááåö äöÏøğÇ æóåõæó ÎóáóŞóß»</div><br>  (To make a rival for Allah while He Alone created you.)

Another Hadith from `Abdullah bin `Amr  Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóßúÈóÑõ ÇáúßóÈóÇÆöÑö: ÇáöÅÔúÑóÇßõ ÈöÇááåö¡ æóÚõŞõæŞõ ÇáúæóÇáöÏóíúäö Ãóæú ŞóÊúáõ ÇáäøóİúÓö ÔÚÈÉ ÇáÔÇß æóÇáúíóãöíäõ ÇáúÛóãõæÓ»</div><br>  (The greatest sins are: To join others in worship with Allah, to be undutiful to one's parents - or to take a life) Shu`bah was uncertain of which one - (and the false oath). Recorded by Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasai.  Another Hadith by `Abdullah bin `Amr about Causing one's Parents to be Cursed `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ãöäú ÃóßúÈóÑö ÇáúßóÈóÇÆöÑö Ãóäú íóáúÚóäó ÇáÑøóÌõáõ æóÇáöÏóíúå»</div><br>  (Among the worst of the major sins is for a man to curse his own parents.)

This is the wording of Muslim. At-Tirmidhi said, "Sahih.'' It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓöÈóÇÈõ ÇáúãõÓúáöãö İõÓõæŞñ¡ æóŞöÊóÇáõåõ ßõİúÑ»</div><br>  (Cursing a Muslim is a sin and fighting him is Kufr.)  </div></body></html>
