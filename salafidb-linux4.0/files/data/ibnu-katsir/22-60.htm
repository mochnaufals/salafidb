With regard to those who die for the sake of Allah, whether they are emigrants or not. This Ayah and the Sahih Hadiths guarantee that they will be well provided for and that Allah will show them kindness. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Shurahbil bin As-Simt said: "We spent a long time besieging a stronghold in the land of the Romans. Salman Al-Farisi, may Allah be pleased with him, passed by me and said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ãóÇÊó ãõÑóÇÈöØğÇ ÃóÌúÑóì Çááåõ Úóáóíúåö ãöËúáó Ğóáößó ÇáúÃóÌúÑö¡ æóÃóÌúÑóì Úóáóíúåö ÇáÑøöÒúŞó¡ æóÃóãöäó ãöäó ÇáİóÊøóÇäöíäó¡ æóÇŞúÑóÄõæÇ Åöäú ÔöÆúÊõãú:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÌóÑõæÇú İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö Ëõãøó ŞõÊöáõæÇú Ãóæú ãóÇÊõæÇú áóíóÑúÒõŞóäøóåõãõ Çááøóåõ ÑöÒúŞÇğ ÍóÓóäÇğ æóÅöäøó Çááøóåó áóåõæó ÎóíúÑõ ÇáÑóÒöŞöíäó - áóíõÏúÎöáóäøóåõãú ãøõÏúÎóáÇğ íóÑúÖóæúäóåõ æóÅöäøó Çááøóåó áóÚóáöíãñ Íóáöíãñ »</div><br>  (Whoever dies guarding the borders of Islam, Allah will give him a reward like that reward (of martyr) and will provide for him and keep him safe from trials.

Fadalah bin `Ubayd sat by the grave of the man who had passed away and someone said to him, "Are you neglecting the martyr and not sitting by his grave'' He said, "I would not mind which of these two graves Allah would resurrect me from, for Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÌóÑõæÇú İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö Ëõãøó ŞõÊöáõæÇú Ãóæú ãóÇÊõæÇú áóíóÑúÒõŞóäøóåõãõ Çááøóåõ ÑöÒúŞÇğ ÍóÓóäÇğ</div><br>  (Those who emigrated in the cause of Allah and after that were killed or died, surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them.)'' And he recited these two Ayat, then said, "What should I seek, O you servant, if I were to enter an entrance to His pleasure, and be provided good provisions By Allah, I would not mind which of these two graves Allah would resurrect me from.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó æóãóäú ÚóÇŞóÈó ÈöãöËúáö ãóÇ ÚõæŞöÈó Èöåö</div><br>  (That is so. And whoever has retaliated with the like of that which he was made to suffer....) Muqatil bin Hayan and Ibn Jurayj mentioned that this was revealed about a skirmish in which the Companions encountered some of the idolators. The Muslims urged them not to fight during the Sacred Months, but the idolators insisted on fighting and initiated the aggression. So the Muslims fought them and Allah granted them victory.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó áóÚóİõæøñ ÛóİõæÑñ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah indeed is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.)  </div></body></html>
