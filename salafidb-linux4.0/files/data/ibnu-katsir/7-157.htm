They delivered the good news of his advent to their nations and commanded them to follow him. His descriptions were still apparent in their Books, as the rabbis and the priests well know. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sakhr Al-`Uqayli said that a bedouin man said to him, "I brought a milk-producing camel to Al-Madinah during the life time of Allah's Messenger. After I sold it, I said to myself, `I will meet that man (Muhammad) and hear from him.' So I passed by him while he was walking between Abu Bakr and `Umar, and I followed them until they went by a Jewish man, who was reading from an open copy of the Tawrah. He was mourning a son of his who was dying and who was one of the most handsome boys. The Messenger of Allah asked him (the father),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÔõÏõßó ÈöÇáøóĞöí ÃóäúÒóáó ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉó åóáú ÊóÌöÏõ İöí ßöÊóÇÈößó åóĞóÇ ÕöİóÊöí æóãóÎúÑóÌöí¿»</div><br>  (I ask you by He Who has sent down the Tawrah, do you not find the description of me and my advent in your Book) He nodded his head in the negative. His son said, `Rather, yes, by He Who has sent down the Tawrah! We find the description of you and your advent in our Book. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah. ' The Prophet said (to the Companions),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóŞöíãõæÇ ÇáúíóåõæÏöíøó Úóäú ÃóÎöíßõã»</div><br>  (Stop the Jew (the father) from (taking care of) your brother (in Islam).) The Prophet then personally took care of the son's funeral and led the funeral prayer on him.''' This Hadith is sound and is supported by a similar Hadith in the Sahih narrated from Anas. Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Muthanna said that `Ata' bin Yasar said, "I met `Abdullah bin `Amr and asked him, `Tell me about the description of Allah's Messenger in the Tawrah.' He said, `Yes, by Allah! He is described in the Tawrah, just as he is described in the Qur'an,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÈöìøõ ÅöäøóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÜßó ÔóÇåöÏÇğ æóãõÈóÔøöÑÇğ æóäóĞöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (O Prophet! Verily, We have sent you as a witness, and a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner.) 33:45 as a safe refuge for the unlettered ones. `You are My servant and Messenger. I have called you `Al-Mutawakkil' (who trusts in Allah), not hard or harsh.' Neither uttering foul speech in the markets nor returning evil deed with one in kind. Rather, he forgives and forgoes. Allah will not end his life until He straightens through him the crooked religion, so that they might proclaim, `There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.' He will open through him sealed hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.''' `Ata' then said, "I also met Ka`b and asked him the same question, and his answer did not differ from `Abdullah's answer, even concerning one letter. '' Al-Bukhari recorded it from `Abdullah bin `Amr. It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari up to the word forgoes. And he mentioned the narration of `Abdullah bin `Amr then he said; "It was common in the speech of our Salaf that they describe the Books of the People of the Two Scriptures as the Tawrah, as some Hadiths concur. Allah knows best.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÃúãõÑõåõã ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö æóíóäúåóÜåõãú Úóäö ÇáúãõäúßóÑö</div><br>  (He commands them to do good; and forbids them from evil;) This is the description of the Messenger of Allah in previous Books. These were the true qualities of our Messenger , as well, for he only ordained good and forbade evil. We should mention here that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "When you hear Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú</div><br>  (O you who believe!), then pay it your full attention, for it is a good that you are being commanded, or an evil that you are being forbidden.'' And the most important and greatest of these commands and prohibitions, is that Allah has sent the Messenger to order worshipping Him Alone without partners and forbid worshipping others besides Him. This is the Message that Allah has sent all Messengers with before Muhammad , just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÈóÚóËúäóÇ İöì ßõáøö ÃõãøóÉò ÑøóÓõæáÇğ Ãóäö ÇÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáúØøóÜÛõæÊó</div><br>  (And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): "Worship Allah, and avoid the Taghut (false deities)'')16:36. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÍöáøõ áóåõãõ ÇáØøóíøöÈóÜÊö æóíõÍóÑøöãõ Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáúÎóÈóÜÆöËó</div><br>  (He makes lawful for them the good things, and forbids them from the evil things,) meaning, he makes the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah and Ham, etc., lawful. They were prohibitions that they invented which were only hard for themselves. He also forbids them from evil things, such as the flesh of the pig, Riba, and foods that were treated as lawful although Allah the Exalted had forbidden them. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported this from Ibn `Abbas. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÖóÚõ Úóäúåõãú ÅöÕúÑóåõãú æóÇáÇøñÛúáóÜáó ÇáøóÊöì ßóÇäóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (He (Muhammad) releases them from their heavy burdens, and from the fetters that were upon them.) indicates that Muhammad came with leniency and an easy religion. As mentioned in the Hadith recorded from many routes that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈõÚöËúÊõ ÈöÇáúÍóäöíİöíøóÉö ÇáÓøóãúÍóÉ»</div><br>  (I was sent with the easy way of Hanifiyyah monotheism) The Prophet said to the two Commanders he appointed, Mu`adh and Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, when he sent them to Yemen,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóÔøöÑóÇ æóáóÇ ÊõäóİøöÑóÇ æóíóÓøöÑóÇ æóáóÇ ÊõÚóÓøöÑóÇ æóÊóØóÇæóÚóÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÎúÊóáöİóÇ»</div><br>  (Bring glad tidings and do not drive people away, make things easy and do not make them difficult, obey each other and do not differ among yourselves). Abu Barzah Al-Aslami, the Prophet's Companion, said, "I accompanied the Messenger of Allah and saw how easy he was. The nations that were before us had things made difficult for them in their laws. Allah made the law encompassing and easy for this Ummah. Hence the statement of the Messenger of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÊóÌóÇæóÒó áöÃõãøóÊöí ãóÇ ÍóÏøóËóÊú Èöåö ÃóäúİõÓõåóÇ ãóÇ áóãú ÊóŞõáú Ãóæú ÊóÚúãóá»</div><br>  (Allah has forgiven my Ummah for what occurs in themselves, as long as they do not utter it or act upon it.) The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑõİöÚó Úóäú ÃõãøóÊöí ÇáúÎóØóÃõ æóÇáäøöÓúíóÇäõ æóãóÇ ÇÓõÊõßúÑöåõæÇ Úóáóíúå»</div><br>  (My Ummah was forgiven (by Allah) unintentional errors, forgetfulness and what they are forced to do.)'' This is why Allah has guided this Ummah to proclaim,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÇ áÇó ÊõÄóÇÎöĞúäóÂ Åöä äøóÓöíäóÂ Ãóæú ÃóÎúØóÃúäóÇ ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóáÇó ÊóÍúãöáú ÚóáóíúäóÂ ÅöÕúÑğÇ ßóãóÇ ÍóãóáúÊóåõ Úóáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ãöä ŞóÈúáöäóÇ ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóáÇó ÊõÍóãøöáúäóÇ ãóÇ áÇó ØóÇŞóÉó áóäóÇ Èöåö æóÇÚúİõ ÚóäøóÇ æóÇÛúİöÑú áóäóÇ æóÇÑúÍóãúäóÂ ÃóäÊó ãóæúáóÜäóÇ İóÇäúÕõÑúäóÇ Úóáóì ÇáúŞóæúãö ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  ("Our Lord!

Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawla (Patron, Supporter and Protector) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.) 2:286 It is recorded in Sahih Muslim that the Prophet said that Allah the Exalted said after every one of these supplications, "I shall accept (your supplication).''
