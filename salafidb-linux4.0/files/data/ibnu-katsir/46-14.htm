Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÜóÇãóäó</div><br>  (and believed) `this person who testified to its truthfulness from the Children of Israel, due to his realization that it was the truth.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúÊóßúÈóÑúÊõãú</div><br>  (while you rejected (the truth)!) `whereas you have arrogantly refused to follow it.'

The witness here refers to any witness in general. It includes `Abdullah bin Salam and other from them as well. For indeed, this Ayah was revealed in Makkah before `Abdullah bin Salam had accepted Islam. This is similar to the statement of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ íõÊúáóì Úóáóíúåöãú ŞóÇáõæÇú ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Èöåö Åöäøóåõ ÇáúÍóŞøõ ãöä ÑøóÈøöäóÂ ÅäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáöåö ãõÓúáöãöíäó </div><br>  (And when it is recited to them, they say: "We believe in it.

(28:53) It is also similar to Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÁóÇãöäõæÇú Èöåö Ãóæú áÇó ÊõÄúãöäõæÇú Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúÚöáúãó ãöä ŞóÈúáöåö ÅöĞóÇ íõÊúáóì Úóáóíúåöãú íóÎöÑøõæäó áöáÇøñĞúŞóÇäö ÓõÌøóÏğÇ - æóíóŞõæáõæäó ÓõÈúÍóÇäó ÑóÈøöäóÂ Åöä ßóÇäó æóÚúÏõ ÑóÈøöäóÇ áóãóİúÚõæáÇğ </div><br>  (Verily! Those who were given knowledge before it -- when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in prostration, and they say: "Exalted is our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.'') (17:107-108) It has been narrated from Sa`d, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said, "I have not heard Allah's Messenger say about anyone walking on the surface of the earth that he is of the people of Jannah -- except for `Abdullah bin Salam. Concerning him the following Ayah was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÔóåöÏó ÔóÇåöÏñ ãøöä Èóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó Úóáóì ãöËúáöåö</div><br>  ((at the same time), a witness from among the Children of Israel has testified to something similar)'' This has been recorded in the Two Sahihs and An-Nasa'i. Similarly, Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Ikrimah, Yusuf bin `Abdullah bin Salam, Hilal bin Yasaf, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri, Malik bin Anas and Ibn Zayd all said that this refers to `Abdullah bin Salam. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áóæú ßóÇäó ÎóíúÑÇğ ãøóÇ ÓóÈóŞõæäóÂ Åöáóíúåö</div><br>  (And those who disbelieve say of those who believe: "Had it been good, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it!'') which means that those who disbelieve say of those who believe in the Qur'an: "Had it (the Qur'an) been any good, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it!'' By that, they meant Bilal, `Ammar, Suhayb, Khabbab, may Allah be pleased with them, and others like them of the weak, the male servants, and female servants. The pagans said this only because they thought that they held a high status with Allah, and that He took special care of them. By that, they made a great and obvious error, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞáößó İóÊóäøóÇ ÈóÚúÖóåõãú ÈöÈóÚúÖò áøöíóŞõæáæÇú ÃóåóÜÄõáÇÁö ãóäøó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöã ãøöä ÈóíúäöäóÂ</div><br>  (Thus have We tried some of them with others, that they might say: "Is it these whom Allah has favored from among us'') (6:53) meaning, they wonder how could those weaklings be the ones who were guided from among them. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú ßóÇäó ÎóíúÑÇğ ãøóÇ ÓóÈóŞõæäóÂ Åöáóíúåö</div><br>  (Had it been good, they (the weak and poor) would not have preceded us to it!) Contrary to this is the position of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah: They say about any act or saying that has not been reported from the Companions: "It is an innovation. If there was any good in it, they would have preceded us in doing it, because they have not left off any of the good characteristics except that they hurried to perform them.'' Allah continues,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú áóãú íóåúÊóÏõæÇú Èöåö</div><br>  (And when they have not been guided by it,) meaning, the Qur'an.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóíóŞõæáõæäó åóÜĞóÂ Åöİúßñ ŞóÏöíãñ</div><br>  (they say: "This is an ancient falsehood!'') meaning, an old lie. They mean by this that the Qur'an has been quoted and taken from the ancient people, thereby belittling the Qur'an and its followers. This is clear arrogance, as Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóØóÑõ ÇáúÍóŞøö æóÛóãúØõ ÇáäøóÇÓ»</div><br>  ((Arrogance is) rejecting the truth and belittling the people.) Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ŞóÈúáöåö ßöÊóÇÈõ ãõæÓóì</div><br>  (And before this was the Scripture of Musa) and it was the Tawrah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöãóÇãÇğ æóÑóÍúãóÉğ æóåóÜĞóÇ ßöÊóÜÈñ</div><br>  (as a guide and mercy. And this is a Book) meaning, the Qur'an.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõÕóÏøöŞõ</div><br>  (confirming) meaning, that which came before it of the previous Books.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöÓóÇäÇğ ÚóÑóÈöíøÇğ</div><br>  (in the Arabic tongue,) means that it is eloquent and clear.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíõäĞöÑó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú æóÈõÔúÑóì áöáúãõÍúÓöäöíäó</div><br>  (to warn those who do wrong, and as glad tidings for the doers of good.) meaning, it contains a warning to the dis- believers and glad tidings for the belie- vers. Allah then says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ŞóÇáõæÇú ÑóÈøõäóÇ Çááøóåõ Ëõãøó ÇÓúÊóŞóÜãõæÇú</div><br>  (Verily, those who say: "Our Lord is (only) Allah,'' and thereafter stand firm,) The explanation of this has been dis- cussed earlier in Surat As-Sajdah. See 41:30 Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó Îóæúİñ Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (on them shall be no fear,) meaning, con- cening their future.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó åõãú íóÍúÒóäõæäó</div><br>  (nor shall they grieve.) meaning, over what they have left behind. Allah continues,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÇ ÌóÒóÂÁğ ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein (forever) -- a reward for what they used to do.) meaning, the deeds are a cause for their attaining the mercy and their being engulfed by it -- and Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
