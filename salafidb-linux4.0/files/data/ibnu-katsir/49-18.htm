However, Faith had not yet firmly entered their hearts,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáóÊö ÇáÇøñÚúÑóÇÈõ ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Şõá áøóãú ÊõÄúãöäõæÇú æóáóÜßöä ŞõæáõæÇú ÃóÓúáóãúäóÇ æóáóãøóÇ íóÏúÎõáö ÇáÇíãóÜäõ İöì ŞõáõæÈößõãú</div><br>  (The bedouins say: "We believe.'' Say: "You do not believe, but say, `We have submitted,' for Faith has not yet entered your hearts...'') This honorable Ayah provides proof that Faith is a higher grade than Islam, according to the scholars of the Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. This is also demostrated in the Hadith of Jibril, peace be upon him, when he questioned the Prophet about Islam, then Iman then Ihsan. Thus moving the general matter to one more specific, then even more specific. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amir bin Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas said, "The Messenger of Allah gave (something to) some men and did not give one of them. Sa`d said, `O Allah's Messenger, you gave to so-and-so and so-and-so. However, you gave nothing to so-and-so, even though he is a believer.' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóæú ãõÓúáöãñ¿»</div><br>  (Or say, a Muslim.) Sa`d repeated his statement thrice each time the Prophet answered,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóæú ãõÓúáöãñ¿»</div><br>  (Or say, a Muslim.) The Prophet then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí áóÃõÚúØöí ÑöÌóÇáğÇ æóÃóÏóÚõ ãóäú åõæó ÃóÍóÈøó Åöáóíøó ãöäúåõãú¡İóáóãú ÃõÚúØöåö ÔóíúÆğÇ ãóÎóÇİóÉó Ãóäú íõßóÈøõæÇ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑö Úóáóì æõÌõæåöåöã»</div><br>  (I might give some men and give nothing to others, even though the latter are dearer to me than the former. I do not give them things for fear that they might be thrown on their faces in the Fire.)'' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Therefore, the Prophet made a distinction between the grade of believer and the grade of Muslim, indicating that Iman is a more exclusive grade than Islam. I mentioned this subject in detail supported by evidence, in the beginning of the explanation of the chapter on Iman in Sahih Al-Bukhari, all praise is due to Allah and all the favors are from Him. So this proves that the bedouins whom the Ayah mentioned were not hypocrites, rather they were Muslims in whose hearts Faith was not yet firmly established. They claimed a higher grade for themselves than the grade that they earned, and they were taught a lesson as a consequence. This meaning agrees with the meaning given by Ibn `Abbas, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Qatadah and that preferred by Ibn Jarir. These bedouins were taught a lesson,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõá áøóãú ÊõÄúãöäõæÇú æóáóÜßöä ŞõæáõæÇú ÃóÓúáóãúäóÇ æóáóãøóÇ íóÏúÎõáö ÇáÇíãóÜäõ İöì ŞõáõæÈößõãú</div><br>  (Say: "You do not believe, but say `We are Muslims,' for Faith has not yet entered your hearts...'') meaning, `you have not yet achieved the reality of Faith.'
