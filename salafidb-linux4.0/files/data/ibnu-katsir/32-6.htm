There is no Creator besides Him, no intercessor except the one to whom He gives permission.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó ÊóÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (Will you not then remember) -- this is addressed to those who worship others apart from Him and put their trust in others besides Him -- exalted and sanctified and glorified be He above having any equal, partner, supporter, rival or peer, there is no God or Lord except Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÏóÈøöÑõ ÇáÇøñãúÑó ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö Åöáóì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö Ëõãøó íóÚúÑõÌõ Åöáóíúåö</div><br>  (He directs the command from the heavens to the earth; then it will go up to Him,) means, His command comes down from above the heavens to the furthest boundary of the seventh earth.

The distance between heaven and earth is the distance of five hundred years traveling, and the thickness of the heaven is the distance of five hundred years. Mujahid, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak said, "The distance covered by the angel when he descends or ascends is the distance of five hundred years, but he covers it in the blink of an eye.'' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì íóæúãò ßóÇäó ãöŞúÏóÇÑõåõ Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉò ãøöãøóÇ ÊóÚõÏøõæäóĞóáößó ÚóÇáöãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÇáÔøóåóÜÏóÉö</div><br>  (in one Day, the measurement of which is a thousand years of your reckoning. That is He, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen,) meaning, He is controlling all these affairs. He sees all that His servants do, and all their deeds, major and minor, significant and insignificant, ascend to Him. He is the Almighty Who has subjugated all things to His control, and to Whom everybody submits, and He is Most Merciful to His believing servants. He is Almighty in His mercy and Most Merciful in His might. This is perfection: might combined with mercy and mercy combined with might, for He is Merciful without any hint of weakness.  </div></body></html>
