What these people, upon whom the blessing had been bestowed, should have done, was to accept it and give thanks for it, and try to understand it and act in accordance with it night and day, as was done by the wise ones among them who became Muslim and followed the Messenger , may Allah be pleased with them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóİóáóãú íóÏøóÈøóÑõæÇú ÇáúŞóæúáó</div><br>  (Have they not pondered over the Word,) Qatadah said, "Because, by Allah, if the people had pondered the meaning and understood it properly, they would have found in the Qur'an a deterrent to disobeying Allah. But they only paid attention to the Ayat which are not entirely clear, and so they were destroyed because of that.'' Then Allah says, denouncing the disbelievers of the Quraysh:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú áóãú íóÚúÑöİõæÇú ÑóÓõæáóåõãú İóåõãú áóåõ ãõäßöÑõæäó </div><br>  (Or is it that they did not recognize their Messenger so they deny him) means, `do they not recognize Muhammad and the honesty, trustworthiness and good character with which he grew up among them Can they deny that or argue against it' Ja`far bin Abi Talib said to An-Najashi, the king of Ethiopia: "O King, Allah has sent to us a Messenger whose lineage, honesty and trustworthiness are known to us.'' Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah said something similar to the deputy of Kisra when he wanted to challenge him. When the Byzantine ruler Heraclius asked Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb and his companions -- who were still disbelievers and had not yet become Muslim -- about the characteristics, lineage, honesty and trustworthiness of the Prophet , they could only tell the truth and admit that he was indeed noble and truthful.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú íóŞõæáõæäó Èöåö ÌöäøóÉñ</div><br>  (Or they say: There is madness in him) This is a narration of what the Quraysh said about the Prophet . They said that he was making up the Qur'an by himself, or that he was crazy and did not know what he was saying. Allah tells us that their hearts did not believe that, they knew that what they were saying about the Qur'an was falsehood, for it had come to them from the Words of Allah and could not be resisted or rejected. So Allah challenged them and all the people of the world to produce something like it if they could -- but they could not and would never be able to do so. So Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ÌóÂÁóåõãú ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö æóÃóßúËóÑõåõãú áöáúÍóŞøö ßóÜÑöåõæäó</div><br>  (Nay, but he brought them Al-Haqq, but most of them are averse to the truth.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Truth does not follow Whims and Desires</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæö ÇÊøóÈóÚó ÇáúÍóŞøõ ÃóåúæóÂÁóåõãú áóİóÓóÏóÊö ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊõ æóÇáÇøñÑúÖõ æóãóä İöíåöäøó</div><br>  (And if Al-Haqq had followed their desires, verily, the heavens and the earth, and whosoever is therein would have been corrupted!) Mujahid, Abu Salih and As-Suddi said, "Al-Haqq is Allah, may He be glorified.'' What is meant by the Ayah is that if Allah had responded to the desires in their hearts and prescribed things accordingly, the heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein, would have been corrupted, i.e., because of their corrupt and inconsistent desires. As Allah says of them elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæúáÇó äõÒøöáó åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäõ Úóáóì ÑóÌõáò ãøöäó ÇáúŞóÑúíóÊóíúäö ÚóÙöíãò</div><br>  ("Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of the two towns'') 43:31 Then He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóåõãú íóŞúÓöãõæäó ÑóÍúãóÉó ÑóÈøößó</div><br>  (Is it they who would portion out the mercy of your Lord) 43:32 And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõá áøóæú ÃóäÊõãú Êóãúáößõæäó ÎóÒóÂÆöäó ÑóÍúãóÉö ÑóÈøöì ÅöĞğÇ áÃãúÓóßúÊõãú ÎóÔúíóÉó ÇáÅöäİóÇŞö</div><br>  (Say: "If you possessed the treasure of the mercy of my Lord, then you would surely hold back for fear of spending it.

Only Allah, may He be glorified, is Perfect in all His attributes, words, actions, laws, power and control of His creation, may He be exalted and sanctified. There is no God but He and no Lord besides Him.

Here Allah tells of their stubbornness in their disbelief, in that even if He had removed the calamity from them and made them understand the Qur'an, they still would not follow it; they would still persist in their disbelief and stubborn transgression.

He knows about some- thing that will not happen, but if it were to happen, He knows how it would be.
