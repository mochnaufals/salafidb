They agreed, however, that the trees mentioned here are those that stand on trunks.''`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "An-Najm refers to the plants that lay on the ground.'' Similar was said by Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi and Sufyan Ath-Thawri. This is what Ibn Jarir preferred, may Allah have mercy upon him. Mujahid said, "An-Najm (the star); the one that is in the sky.'' Al-Hasan and Qatadah said similarly. This is the saying that is the most obvious, and Allah knows best, for Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑó Ãóäøó Çááøóåó íóÓúÌõÏõ áóåõ ãóä İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóãóä İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÇáÔøóãúÓõ æóÇáúŞóãóÑõ æóÇáäøõÌõæãõ æóÇáúÌöÈóÇáõ æóÇáÔøóÌóÑõ æóÇáÏøóæóÂÈøõ æóßóËöíÑñ ãøöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (See you not that whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and the moving creatures, and many of mankind prostrate themselves to Allah.)(22:18) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóãóÂÁó ÑóİóÚóåóÇ æóæóÖóÚó ÇáúãöíÒóÇäó </div><br>  (And the heaven He has raised high, and He has set up the balance.) meaning the justice, as He said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ÑõÓõáóäóÇ ÈöÇáúÈóíøöäóÜÊö æóÃóäÒóáúäóÇ ãóÚóåõãõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó æóÇáúãöíÒóÇäó áöíóŞõæãó ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÈöÇáúŞöÓúØö</div><br>  (Indeed, We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and sent down with them the Book and the balance that mankind may keep up equity.)(57:25) Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇøó ÊóØúÛóæúÇú İöì ÇáúãöíÒóÇäö </div><br>  (In order that you may not transgress the balance.) meaning, He created the heavens and earth in justice and truth so that everything is founded on, and observing, justice and truth.

Allah raised the heavens and put down, or laid, the earth and balanced it with firm mountains, so that it would be stable for its residents that live on it, i.e. the various types and kinds of creatures, different in species, shape, color and language. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said that Al-An'am means the creatures.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåóÇ İóÜßöåóÉñ</div><br>  (Therein are fruits,) of various colors, taste and scent,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáäøóÎúáõ ĞóÇÊõ ÇáÇøñßúãóÇãö</div><br>  (and date palms producing Akmam.) Allah mentioned the date tree here specifically because of its benefit, both fresh and dry. Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn `Abbas said said Al-Akmam, means sheathed fruit stalks. Similar was said by more than one of the scholars of Tafsir, it refers to the stalks that the seeds grow in to become a cluster of dates, unripe green dates then they ripen and ripen more. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÍóÈøõ Ğõæ ÇáúÚóÕúİö æóÇáÑøóíúÍóÇäõ </div><br>  (And also corn, with (its) `Asf, and Rayhan.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said that in,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÍóÈøõ Ğõæ ÇáúÚóÕúİö</div><br>  (And also corn, with (its) `Asf), `Asf means straw.'' Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, "`Asf is green leaves cut from the stem, so it is called `Asf when it dries out.'' Similarly, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Abu Malik said that `Asf means straw. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others said that Rayhan means leaves, while Al-Hasan said that it means sweet-scented plants. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that Rayhan means green leaves. The meanings here, and Allah knows best, are the various crops that produce straw, such as wheat and barley, and Rayhan are the leaves that grow on the stems. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Mankind is surrounded by Allah's Favors</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöÃóìøö ÁóÇáÇÁö ÑóÈøößõãóÇ ÊõßóĞøöÈóÇäö </div><br>  (Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) meaning, "O mankind and Jinn, which of the favors that Allah has given to you do you deny'' Mujahid and others said this, and it is apparent when one reads what comes after it. Meaning the favors that are obvious to you while you are surrounded by them, you cannot deny or reject them. So we say, just as the believers among the Jinns said, "O Allah! None of Your favors do we deny. All praise is due to You.'' Ibn `Abbas used to say, "Nay, our Lord!'' meaning, "None of Your favors do we deny.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóáóŞó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ãöä ÕóáúÕóÜáò ßóÇáúİóÎøóÇÑö - æóÎóáóŞó ÇáúÌóÂäøó ãöä ãøóÇÑöÌò ãøöä äøóÇÑò İóÈöÃóìøö ÁóÇáÇÁö ÑóÈøößõãóÇ ÊõßóĞøöÈóÇäö ÑóÈøõ ÇáúãóÔúÑöŞóíúäö æóÑóÈøõ ÇáúãóÛúÑöÈóíúäö İóÈöÃóìøö ÁóÇáÇÁö ÑóÈøößõãóÇ ÊõßóĞøöÈóÇäö </div><br>  </div></body></html>
