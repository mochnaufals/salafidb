Mujahid said that this part of the Ayah refers to the nine miracles.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäú ÃóÎúÑöÌú Şóæúãóßó</div><br>  (Bring out your people) he is being commanded;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÎúÑöÌú Şóæúãóßó ãöäó ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö Åöáóì ÇáäøõæÑö</div><br>  (Bring out your people from darkness into light,) call them to all that is good and righteous, in order that they might turn away from the darkness of ignorance and misguidance they indulged in, to the light of guidance and the enlightenment of faith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóĞóßøöÑúåõãú ÈöÃóíøóÇãö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (and remind them of the annals (or days) of Allah) remind them (O Musa) of Allah's days, meaning, favors and bounties which He bestowed on them when He delivered them from the grip of Fir`awn and his injustice, tyranny and brutality. This is when Allah delivered them from their enemy, made a passage for them through the sea, shaded them with clouds, sent down manna and quails for them, and other favors and bounties. Mujahid, Qatadah and several others said this. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğáößó áÂíóÜÊò áøößõáøö ÕóÈøóÇÑò ÔóßõæÑò</div><br>  (Truly, therein are Ayat for every patient, thankful (person).) Allah says, `Our delivering of Our loyal supporters among the Children of Israel from the grasp of Fir`awn and saving them from the disgraceful torment, provides a lesson to draw from for those who are patient in the face of affliction, and thankful in times of prosperity. Qatadah said, "Excellent is the servant who if he is tested, he observes patience, and if he is granted prosperity, he is thankful for it.'' It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÃóãúÑó ÇáúãõÄúãöäö ßõáøóåõ ÚóÌóÈñ¡ áóÇ íóŞúÖöí Çááåõ áóåõ ŞóÖóÇÁğ ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóåõ¡ Åöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóÊúåõ ÖóÑøóÇÁõ ÕóÈóÑó¡ İóßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóåõ¡ æóÅöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóÊúåõ ÓóÑøóÇÁõ ÔóßóÑó¡ İóßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóå»</div><br>  (Verily, all of the matter of the believer is amazing, for every decision that Allah decrees for him is good for him. If an affliction strikes him, he is patient and this is good for him; if a bounty is give to him, he is thankful and this is good for him.)  </div></body></html>
