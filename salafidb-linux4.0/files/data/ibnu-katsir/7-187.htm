It was said that this Ayah was revealed about the Quraysh or the Jews, although it appears that it was about the Quraysh, because this Ayah was revealed in Makkah. The Quraysh used to ask about the Last Hour, because they used to deny it and discount its coming.

Also, Ma`mar said that Al-Hasan commented on this Ayah, "When the Last Hour comes, it will be heavy on the residents of the heavens and earth.''

When it rises (from the west) and the people see it, then, all people will believe. However, this is when faith does not benefit a soul that did not believe beforehand nor earned good in faith. The Hour will (all of a sudden) commence while two men have spread a garment between them, and they will neither have time to conclude the transaction nor to fold the garment. The Hour will commence after a man milked his animal, but he will not have time to drink it. The Hour will start when a man is making his watering hole (for his animals), but will not have time to make use of the pool. And the Hour will commence while a man has raised his hand with a bite to his mouth, but will not eat it.) Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÜóáõæäóßó ßóÃóäøóßó Íóİöìøñ ÚóäúåóÇ</div><br>  (They ask you as if you have good knowledge of it.) "As if you have good relations and friendship with them!'' Ibn `Abbas said, "When the people (pagans of Quraysh) asked the Prophet about the Last Hour, they did so in a way as if Muhammad was their friend! Allah revealed to him that its knowledge is with Him Alone and He did not inform a close angel or Messenger of it.'' The correct explanation for this Ayah is, as narrated from Mujahid, through Ibn Abi Najih,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÜóáõæäóßó ßóÃóäøóßó Íóİöìøñ ÚóäúåóÇ</div><br>  (They ask you as if you have Hafi of it.) means, `as if you had asked about its time and so its knowledge is with you.' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÅöäøóãóÇ ÚöáúãõåóÇ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö æóáóÜßöäøó ÃóßúËóÑó ÇáäøóÇÓö áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (Say: "The knowledge thereof is with Allah (Alone), but most of mankind know not.'') When Jibril came in the shape of a bedouin man to teach the people matters of their religion, he sat next to the Messenger of Allah asking him as if to learn. Jibril asked the Messenger about Islam, then about Iman (faith) then about Ihsan (Excellence in the religion). He asked next, "When will the Hour start'' Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÇáúãóÓúÄõæáõ ÚóäúåóÇ ÈöÃóÚúáóãó ãöäó ÇáÓøóÇÆöá»</div><br>  (He who is asked about it has no more knowledge of it than the questioner.)  Therefore, the Prophet was saying, `I have no more knowledge in it than you (O Jibril), nor does anyone have more knowledge in it than anyone else.' The Prophet then recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÚöäÏóåõ Úöáúãõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö</div><br>  (Verily, Allah, with Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour.) 31:34  In another narration, Jibril asked the Prophet about the portents of the Hour, and the Prophet mentioned them. The Prophet also said in this narration,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İöí ÎóãúÓò áóÇ íóÚúáóãõåõäøó ÅöáøóÇ Çááå»</div><br>  (Five, their knowledge is only with Allah) then recited this Ayah (31:34). In response to the Prophet's answers after each question, Jibril would say, "You have said the truth.'' This made the Companions wonder about this questioner who would ask a question and attest to every answer he was given. When Jibril went away, the Messenger of Allah said to the Companions,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóĞóÇ ÌöÈúÑöíáõ ÃóÊóÇßõãú íõÚóáøöãõßõãú Ïöíäóßõã»</div><br>  (This is Jibril, he came to teach you matters of your religion.) In yet another narration, the Prophet commented,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóãóÇ ÃóÊóÇäöí İöí ÕõæÑóÉò ÅöáøóÇ ÚóÑóİúÊõåõ İöíåóÇ ÅöáøóÇ ÕõæÑóÊõåõ åóĞöå»</div><br>  (I recognized him (Jibril) in every shape he came to me in, except this one.) Muslim recorded that `Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said; "When the bedouins used to come to the Prophet , they used to ask him about the Hour. The Prophet would answer them, while pointing at the youngest person among them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäú íóÚöÔú åóĞóÇ áóãú íõÏúÑößúåõ ÇáúåóÑóãõ ÍóÊøóì ŞóÇãóÊú Úóáóíúßõãú ÓóÇÚóÊõßõã»</div><br>  (If this (young man) lives, he will not become old before your Hour starts.)  The Prophet meant the end of their life that introduces them to the life in Barzakh, which is between this life and the Hereafter. Muslim recorded that Anas said that a man asked Allah's Messenger about the Hour, and the Messenger answered,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäú íóÚöÔú åóĞóÇ ÇáúÛõáóÇãõ İóÚóÓóì Ãóäú áóÇ íõÏúÑößóåõ ÇáúåóÑóãõ ÍóÊøóì ÊóŞõæãó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉ»</div><br>  (If this young boy lives, it might be that he will not become old before the Hour starts.) Only Muslim collected this Hadith. Jabir bin `Abdullah said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah saying, one month before he died,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóÓúÃóáõæäöí Úóäö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö¡ æóÅöäøóãóÇ ÚöáúãõåóÇ ÚöäúÏó Çááåö¡ æóÃõŞúÓöãõ ÈöÇááåö ãóÇ Úóáóì ÙóåúÑö ÇáúÃóÑúÖö Çáúíóæúãó ãöäú äóİúÓò ãóäúİõæÓóÉò ÊóÃúÊöí ÚóáóíúåóÇ ãöÇÆóÉõ ÓóäóÉ»</div><br>  (You keep asking me about the Hour, when its knowledge is with Allah. I swear by Allah that there is no living soul on the face of the earth now will be alive a hundred years from now.) Muslim collected this Hadith. A similar Hadith is recorded in Two Sahihs from Ibn `Umar, but he commented, "The Messenger of Allah meant that his generation will be finished by that time reach its appointed term.''

They mentioned the matter of the Last Hour, and they asked Ibrahim about it, who said, `I do not have knowledge of it.' They asked Musa about it and he said, `I have no knowledge of it.' They then asked `Isa about it, and he said, `As for when it will occur, only Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, knows that. My Lord has conveyed to me that the Dajjal (False Messiah) will appear, and I will have two staffs (spears) with me. When he sees me, he will dissolve just as lead is dissolved. Allah will destroy him when he sees me, and the tree and the stone will say, `O Muslim! There is a disbeliever under (behind) me, so come and kill him.' Allah will destroy them (the Dajjal and his army), and the people will safely go back to their lands and areas. Thereafter, Gog and Magog will appear, and they will be swarming from every mound, sweeping over the earth and destroying everything they pass by. They will drink every water source they pass. The people will come to me complaining about Gog and Magog and will invoke Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, against them, and Allah will bring death to all of them until the earth rots with their stinking odor. Allah will send down rain on them and the rain will carry their corpses, until it throws them in the sea... My Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored has conveyed to me that when this occurs, the Hour will be just like the pregnant women when the term of pregnancy is full, her family does not know when she will surprise them and give birth, whether by night or by day.) Ibn Majah also collected a similar Hadith Therefore these are the greatest of the Messengers but they did not have knowledge of the appointed term of the Hour. They asked `Isa about it and he spoke about its Signs, since he will descend in the last generations of this Ummah, implementing the Law of Allah's Messenger , killing the Dajjal and destroying Gog and Magog people by the blessing of his supplication. `Isa merely informed them of the knowledge Allah gave him on this subject. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hudhayfah said, "The Messenger of Allah was asked about the Hour and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÚöáúãõåóÇ ÚöäúÏó ÑóÈøöí ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó áóÇ íõÌóáøöíåóÇ áöæóŞúÊöåóÇ ÅöáøóÇ åõæó¡ æóáóßöäú ÓóÃõÎúÈöÑõßõãú ÈöãóÔóÇÑöíØöåóÇ æóãóÇ íóßõæäõ Èóíúäó íóÏóíúåóÇ¡ Åöäøó Èóíúäó íóÏóíúåóÇ İöÊúäóÉğ æóåóÑóÌğÇ»</div><br>  (Its knowledge is with my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored, none can reveal its time except Him.

None among the collectors of the six Sunan collected this Hadith using this chain of narration.
