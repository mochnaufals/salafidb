The reason why the haste of man is mentioned here is that when mention is made of those who mock the Messenger , (the believers) will want to avenge them swiftly, and that so should happen sooner. Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎõáöŞó ÇáÅäúÓóÇäõ ãöäú ÚóÌóáò</div><br>  (Man is created of haste.) because He delays (the punishment) until a time when, once He seizes him, He will never let him go. He delays it, then He hastens it; He waits, then He does not delay any longer. So He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÃõæúÑöíßõãú ÁóÇíóÜÊöì</div><br>  (I will show you My Ayat) meaning, My vengeance, ruling and power over those who disobey Me.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõæäö</div><br>  (So ask Me not to hasten (them).)  </div></body></html>
