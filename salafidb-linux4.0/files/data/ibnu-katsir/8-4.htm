They neither believe in any of Allah's Ayat nor trust (in Allah) nor pray if they are alone nor pay the Zakah due on their wealth. Allah stated that they are not believers. He then described the believers by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÇ ĞõßöÑó Çááøóåõ æóÌöáóÊú ŞõáõæÈõåõãú</div><br>  (The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts) and they perform what He has ordained,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÊõáöíóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ÁóÇíóÜÊõåõ ÒóÇÏóÊúåõãú ÅöíãóÜäÇğ</div><br>  (and when His Ayat are recited unto them, they increase their faith) and conviction,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóáóì ÑóÈøöåöãú íóÊóæóßøóáõæäó</div><br>  (and they put their trust in their Lord), having hope in none except Him. '' Mujahid commented on,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌöáóÊú ŞõáõæÈõåõãú</div><br>  (their hearts Wajilat), "Their hearts become afraid and fearful.'' Similar was said by As-Suddi and several others. The quality of a true believer is that when Allah is mentioned, he feels a fear in his heart, and thus implements His orders and abstains from His prohibitions. Allah said in a similar Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÇ İóÚóáõæÇú İóÜÍöÔóÉğ Ãóæú ÙóáóãõæÇú ÃóäúİõÓóåõãú ĞóßóÑõæÇú Çááøóåó İóÇÓúÊóÛúİóÑõæÇú áöĞõäõæÈöåöãú æóãóä íóÛúİöÑõ ÇáĞøõäõæÈó ÅöáÇøó Çááøóåõ æóáóãú íõÕöÑøõæÇú Úóáóì ãóÇ İóÚóáõæÇú æóåõãú íóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (And those who, when they have committed Fahishah (immoral sin) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; -- and none can forgive sins but Allah -- and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know) 3:135, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ãóäú ÎóÇİó ãóŞóÇãó ÑóÈøöåö æóäóåóì ÇáäøóİúÓó Úóäö Çáúåóæóì - İóÅöäøó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó åöìó ÇáúãóÃúæóì </div><br>  (But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from vain desires. Verily, Paradise will be his abode.) 79:40-41  Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated that As-Suddi commented,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÇ ĞõßöÑó Çááøóåõ æóÌöáóÊú ŞõáõæÈõåõãú</div><br> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>(The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts)</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  "A man might be thinking of committing injustice or a sin.

Al-Bukhari and other scholars relied on this Ayah (8:2) and those similar, as evidence that faith increases and varies in strength from heart to heart. This is also the view of the majority of the scholars of Islam, prompting some scholars, such as Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad bin Hanbal and Abu `Ubayd to declare that this is the consensus of the Ummah, as we mentioned in the beginning of the explanation of Sahih Al-Bukhari. All the thanks and praises are due to Allah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reality of Tawakkul</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóáóì ÑóÈøöåöãú íóÊóæóßøóáõæäó</div><br>  (And they put their trust in their Lord.)  Therefore, the believers hope in none except Allah, direct their dedication to Him alone, seek refuge with Him alone, invoke Him alone for their various needs and supplicate to Him alone. They know that whatever He wills, occurs and that whatever He does not will never occurs, that He alone is the One Who has the decision in His kingdom, without partners; none can avert the decision of Allah and He is swift in reckoning. Hence the statement of Sa`id bin Jubayr, "Tawakkul of Allah is the essence of faith. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Deeds of Faithful Believers</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íõŞöíãõæäó ÇáÕøóáóæÉó æóãöãøóÇ ÑóÒóŞúäóÜåõãú íõäİöŞõæäó </div><br>  (Who perform the Salah and spend out of what We have provided them.)  Allah describes the actions of the believers after He mentioned their faith. The acts mentioned here include all types of righteous acts, such as establishing prayer, which is Allah's right. Qatadah said, "Establishing the prayer requires preserving its times, making ablution for it, bowing down and prostrating.'' Muqatil bin Hayyan said, "Establishing the prayer means to preserve its times, perform perfect purity for it, perform perfect bowings and prostrations, recite the Qur'an during it, sitting for Tashahhud and reciting the Salah (invoking Allah's blessings) for the benefit of the Prophet.''  Spending from what Allah has granted includes giving the Zakah and the rest of the what is due from the servant, either what is obligatory or recommended. All of the servants are Allah's dependents, and the most beloved among them to Him are the most beneficial to His creation. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reality of Faith</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó ÍóŞøÇğ</div><br>  (It is they who are the believers in truth.) means, those who have these qualities are the believers with true faith. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Fruits of Perfect Faith</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóåõãú ÏóÑóÌóÜÊñ ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  (For them are grades of dignity with their Lord) meaning, they have different grades, ranks and status in Paradise,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõãú ÏóÑóÌóÜÊñ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö æÇááøóåõ ÈóÕöíÑñ ÈöãóÇ íóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (They are in varying grades with Allah, and Allah is All-Seer of what they do.)3:163  Next, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÛúİöÑóÉñ</div><br>  (and forgiveness), therefore, Allah will forgive them their sins and reward them for their good deeds. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Ãóåúáó Úöáøöíøöíäó áóíóÑóÇåõãú ãóäú ÃóÓúİóáó ãöäúåõãú ßóãóÇ ÊóÑóæúäó ÇáúßóæúßóÈó ÇáúÛóÇÈöÑó İöí ÃõİõŞò ãöäú ÂİóÇŞö ÇáÓøóãóÇÁ»</div><br>  (The residents of `Illiyyin (in Paradise) are seen from those below them, just as you see the distant planet in the horizon of the sky.)

They are for men who have faith in Allah and believed in the Messengers.)  In a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and the collectors of Sunan, Abu `Atiyyah said that Ibn Abu Sa`id said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Ãóåúáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö áóíóÊóÑóÇÁóæäó Ãóåúáó ÇáÏøóÑóÌóÇÊö ÇáúÚõáóì ßóãóÇ ÊóÑóÇÁóæúäó ÇáúßóæúßóÈó ÇáúÛóÇÈöÑó İöí ÃõİõŞö ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö æóÅöäøó ÃóÈóÇ ÈóßúÑò æóÚõãóÑó ãöäúåõãú æóÃóäúÚóãóÇ»</div><br>  (Residents of Paradise see the residents of the highest grades just as you see the distant planet in the horizon of the sky.
