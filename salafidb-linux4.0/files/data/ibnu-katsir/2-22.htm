He also surrounded them with blessings, both hidden and apparent. He made the earth a resting place for them, just like the bed, stable with the firm mountains.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóãóÂÁó ÈöäóÂÁğ</div><br>  (And the sky as a canopy) meaning, `a ceiling'.

Hence, Allah caused the various types of vegetation and fruits to grow as a means of sustenance for people and their cattle. Allah reiterated this bounty in various parts of the Qur'an.  There is another Ayah that is similar to this Ayah (2:22), that is, Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóÜáó áóßõÜãõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ŞóÜÑóÇÑÇğ æóÇáÓøóãóÂÁó ÈöäóÜÂÁğ æóÕóæøóÑóßõÜãú İóÃóÍúÓóäó ÕõæóÑóßõÜãú æóÑóÒóŞóßõÜãú ãøöäó ÇáØøóíøöÈóÜÊö Ğóáößõãõ Çááøóåõ ÑóÈøõßõÜãú İóÊóÜÈóÜÑóßó Çááøóåõ ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (It is He Who has made for you the earth as a dwelling place and the sky as a canopy, and has given you shape and made your shapes good (looking) and has provided you with good things. That is Allah, your Lord, so Blessed be Allah, the Lord of all that exists) (40:64).  The meaning that is reiterated here is that Allah is the Creator, the Sustainer, the Owner and Provider of this life, all that is in and on it. Hence, He alone deserves to be worshipped, and no one and nothing is to be associated with Him. This is why Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóÌúÚóáõæÇú ááøóåö ÃóäÏóÇÏÇğ æóÃóäÊõãú ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He alone has the right to be worshipped)) (2:22).

So either order, or I will do it.' Yahya said, 'My brother! I fear that if you do it before me, I will be punished or the earth will be shaken under my feet.' Hence, Yahya bin Zakariya called the Children of Israel to Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), until they filled the Masjid. He sat on the balcony, thanked Allah and praised him and then said, `Allah ordered me to implement five commandments and that I should order you to adhere to them. The first is that you worship Allah alone and not associate any with Him. The example of this command is the example of a man who bought a servant from his money with paper or gold. The servant started to work for the master, but was paying the profits to another person. Who among you would like his servant to do that Allah created you and sustains you. Therefore, worship Him alone and do not associate anything with Him. I also command you to pray, for Allah directs His Face towards His servant's face, as long as the servant does not turn away. So when you pray, do not turn your heads to and fro. I also command you to fast. The example of it is the example of a man in a group of men and he has some musk wrapped in a piece of cloth, and consequently, all of the group smells the scent of the wrapped musk. Verily, the odor of the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allah than the scent of musk. I also command you to give charity. The example of this is the example of a man who was captured by the enemy. They tied his hands to his neck and brought him forth to cut off his neck. He said to them, 'Can I pay a ransom for myself' He kept ransoming himself with small and large amounts until he liberated himself. I also command you to always remember Allah. The example of this deed is that of a man who the enemy is tirelessly pursuing. He takes refuge in a fortified fort. When the servant remembers Allah, he will be resorting to the best refuge from Satan.)  Al-Harith then narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÃóäóÇ ÂãõÑõßõãú ÈöÎóãúÓò Çááåõ ÃóãóÑóäöí Èöåöäøó: ÇáúÌóãóÇÚóÉö æóÇáÓøóãúÚö æóÇáØøóÇÚóÉö æóÇáúåöÌúÑóÉö æóÇáúÌöåóÇÏö İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö.

Stick to the Jama`ah (community of the faithful), listen and obey (your leaders) and perform Hijrah (migration) and Jihad for the sake of Allah. Whoever abandons the Jama`ah, even the distance of a hand span, will have removed the tie of Islam from his neck, unless he returns. Whoever uses the slogans of Jahiliyah (the pre-Islamic period of ignorance) he will be among those kneeling in Jahannam (Hellfire).) They said, "O Messenger of Allah! Even if he prays and fasts'' He said, (Even if he prays, fasts and claims to be Muslim. So call the Muslims with their names that Allah has called them: `The Muslims, the believing servants of Allah.')  This is a Hasan Hadith, and it contains the statement, "Allah has created and sustains you, so worship Him and do not associate anything with Him in worship.'' This statement is relevant in the Ayat (2:21-22) we are discussing here and supports singling Allah in worship, without partners. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Signs of Allah's Existence</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Several scholars of Tafsir, like Ar-Razi and others, used these Ayat as an argument for the existence of the Creator, and it is a most worthy method of argument. Indeed, whoever ponders over the things that exist, the higher and lower creatures, their various shapes, colors, behavior, benefits and ecological roles, then he will realize the ability, wisdom, knowledge, perfection and majesty of their Creator. Once a bedouin was asked about the evidence to Allah's existence, he responded, "All praise is due to Allah! The camel's dung testifies to the existence of the camel, and the track testifies to the fact that someone was walking. A sky that holds the giant stars, a land that has fairways and a sea that has waves, does not all of this testify that the Most Kind, Most Knowledgeable exists''  Hence, whoever gazes at the sky in its immensity, its expanse, and the various kinds of planets in it, some of which appear stationary in the sky - whoever gazes at the seas that surround the land from all sides, and the mountains that were placed on the earth to stabilize it, so that whoever lives on land, whatever their shape and color, are able to live and thrive - whoever reads Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáúÌöÈóÇáö ÌõÏóÏñ ÈöíÖñ æóÍõãúÑñ ãøõÎúÊóáöİñ ÃóáúæóäõåóÇ æóÛóÑóÇÈöíÈõ ÓõæÏñæóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö æóÇáÏøóæóÂÈøö æóÇáÇøñäúÚóÜãö ãõÎúÊóáöİñ Ãóáúæóäõåõ ßóĞóáößó ÅöäøóãóÇ íóÎúÔóì Çááøóåó ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö ÇáúÚõáóãóÇÁõ</div><br>  (And among the mountains are streaks white and red, of varying colours and (others) very black. And likewise, men and Ad-Dawabb (moving (living) creatures, beasts) and cattle are of various colours. It is only those who have knowledge among His servants that fear Allah) (35: 27-28).  Whoever thinks about the running rivers that travel from area to area bringing benefit, whoever ponders over what Allah has created on earth; various animals and plants of different tastes, scents, shapes and colors that are a result of unity between land and water, whoever thinks about all of this then he will realize that these facts testify to the existence of the Creator, His perfect ability, wisdom, mercy, kindness, generosity and His overall compassion for His creation. There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, nor is there a Lord besides Him, upon Him we rely and to Him we turn in repentance. There are numerous Ayat in the Qur'an on this subject.  </div></body></html>
