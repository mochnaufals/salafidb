A Hadith states that, <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Ordering the Prophet to have Patience and to glorify Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÕúÈöÑú áöÍõßúãö ÑóÈøößó İóÅöäøóßó ÈöÃóÚúíõäöäóÇ</div><br>  (So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes;) meaning, `be patient in the face of their annoyance and do not be concerned about it, for you are under Our Eyes and Protection, and We will surely protect you from the people,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÍóãúÏö ÑóÈøößó Íöíäó ÊóŞõæãõ</div><br>  (and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) Ad-Dahhak said, "Meaning to stand for the Salah (and say): "Glorious are You and with Your praise, Hallowed be Your Name, Exalted be Your majesty, and there is no God (worthy of worship) except You.'' In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that `Umar used to recite this supplication when he began Salah. Ahmad and the Sunan compilers recorded this Hadith from Abu Sa`id and other Companions, who stated that the Prophet used to say that. Abu Al-Jawza' commented on the Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÍóãúÏö ÑóÈøößó Íöíäó ÊóŞõæãõ</div><br>  (and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) "From your sleep, from your bed.'' And this is the view chosen by Ibn Jarir. Suporting this view is the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÊóÚóÇÑøó ãöäó Çááøóíúáö İóŞóÇáó: áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ æóÍúÏóåõ áóÇ ÔóÑöíßó áóåõ¡ áóåõ Çáúãõáúßõ æóáóåõ ÇáúÍóãúÏõ¡ æóåõæó Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ¡ ÓõÈúÍóÇäó Çááåö æóÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááåö æóáóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ æóÇááåõ ÃóßúÈóÑõ¡ æóáóÇ Íóæúáó æóáóÇ ŞõæøóÉó ÅöáøóÇ ÈöÇááåö.

For Him is the kingdom and all praise is due to Him. He has power over all things. Glory be to Allah, and all praise is due to Allah, and La illaha illallah and Allah is Greater. There is neither might nor power except Allah.' And then says, `O Lord! Forgive me.' Or invokes (Allah), he will be responded to it, and if he intends and performs ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted.) Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers also recorded this Hadith. Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid commented on the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÍóãúÏö ÑóÈøößó Íöíäó ÊóŞõæãõ</div><br>  (and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) saying, "From every gathering you sit in.'' Ath-Thawri said that Abu Ishaq narrated that Abu Al-Ahwas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÍóãúÏö ÑóÈøößó Íöíäó ÊóŞõæãõ</div><br>  (and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) "When a person wants to stand from a gathering, he says: `Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise.''' Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÌóáóÓó İöí ãóÌúáöÓò İóßóËõÑó İöíåö áóÛóØõåõ¡ İóŞóÇáó ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú íóŞõæãó ãöäú ãóÌúáöÓöåö: ÓõÈúÍóÇäóßó Çááúåõãøó æóÈöÍóãúÏößó¡ ÃóÔúåóÏõ Ãóäú áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ ÃóäúÊó¡ ÃóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõßó æóÃóÊõæÈõ Åöáóíúßó¡ ÅöáøóÇ ÛóİóÑó Çááåõ áóåõ ãóÇ ßóÇäó İöí ãóÌúáöÓöåö Ğáöß»</div><br>  (Whoever sits in a gathering in which he speaks idle excessively, but says before he stands up to depart that gathering, `Glory be to You O Allah , and with Your praise, I testify that there is no God (worthy of worship) except You, I seek Your forgiveness, and I repent to You.' Then, Allah will forgive him what he has said in that gathering.) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and this is his wording, and it was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in `Amal Al-Yawm wal-Laylah. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih.'' It was also recorded by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak, and he said, "Its chain meets the criteria of Muslim.'' Allah the Exalted said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó Çáøóíúáö İóÓóÈøöÍúåõ</div><br>  (And in the nighttime also glorify His praises), meaning remember and worship Allah by reciting the Qur'an and praying at night.

These two Rak`ahs are an established Sunnah performed before the stars are about to set. It is confimred in the Two Sahihs from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, "The Prophet was never more regular and particular in offering any voluntary prayer than the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of the Fajr prayer.'' In another narration collected by Muslim, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑóßúÚóÊóÇ ÇáúİóÌúÑö ÎóíúÑñ ãöäó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóãóÇ İöíåóÇ»</div><br>  (Two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs before Fajr are better than this life and all that in it.)This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Tur, all praise and gratitude is due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
