He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ áÇó íóãúáößõ áóåõãú ÑöÒúŞğÇ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÔóíúÆğÇ</div><br>  (such as do not have power to grant them any provision from the heavens or the earth) meaning, nobody can cause rain to fall, or make plants and trees grow. They cannot do these things for them- selves, even if they wanted to. Thus Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóÖúÑöÈõæÇú áöáøóåö ÇáÇøñãúËóÇáó</div><br>  (So do not give examples on behalf of Allah.) meaning, do not set up rivals to Him or describe anything as being like Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóÚúáóãõ æóÃóäÊõãú áÇó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (Truly, Allah knows and you know not.) meaning, He knows and bears witness that there is no god but Him, but you are ignorant and associate others in worship with Him.  </div></body></html>
