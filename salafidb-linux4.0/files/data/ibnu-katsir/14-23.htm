Iblis, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the latter, in order to add depression to their depression, sorrow to their sorrow and grief to their grief. He will declare,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó æóÚóÏóßõãú æóÚúÏó ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  `(Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth.) by the words of His Messengers that if you follow them, you will gain safety and deliverance. Truly, Allah's promise was true and correct news, while I promised you then betrayed you.' Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚöÏõåõãú æóíõãóäøöíåöãú æóãóÇ íóÚöÏõåõãú ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ ÅöáÇøó ÛõÑõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (He (Shaytan) makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan's promises are nothing but deceptions.) 4:120   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó áöìó Úóáóíúßõãú ãøöä ÓõáúØóÜäò</div><br>  (I had no authority over you) Shaytan will say, `I had no proof for what I called you to, nor evidence for what I promised you,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Ãóä ÏóÚóæúÊõßõãú İóÇÓúÊóÌóÈúÊõãú áöì</div><br>  (except that I called you, and you responded to me.) even though the Messengers establish the proof and unequivocal evidences against you and affirmed the truth of what they were sent to you with.

Ibn Jarir commented; "I deny being a partner with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.'' This opinion is the most plausible, for Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäú ÃóÖóáøõ ãöãøóä íóÏúÚõæ ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ãóä áÇøó íóÓúÊóÌöíÈõ áóåõ Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö æóåõãú Úóä ÏõÚóÂÆöåöãú ÛóÜİöáõæäó - æóÅöĞóÇ ÍõÔöÑó ÇáäøóÇÓõ ßóÇäõæÇú áóåõãú ÃóÚúÏóÂÁğ æóßóÇäõæÇú ÈöÚöÈóÇÏóÊöåöãú ßóÜİöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And who is more astray than one who calls on others besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)46:5-6 and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó ÓóíóßúİõÑõæäó ÈöÚöÈóÜÏóÊöåöãú æóíóßõæäõæäó Úóáóíúåöãú ÖöÏøÇğ </div><br>  (Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.)19:82 Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, the wrongdoers), who deviate from truth and follow falsehood, will earn a painful torment. It appears that this part of the Ayah narrates the speech that Shaytan will deliver to the people of the Fire after they enter it, as we stated. `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, "On the Day of Resurrection, two speakers will address the people.
