Say (O Muhammad ): "Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's permission, confirming what came before it (i.e. the Tawrah and the Injil) and guidance and glad tidings for the believers). (98. "Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibril and Mika'il, then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.'')</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Jews are the Enemies of Jibril</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir At-Tabari said, "The scholars of Tafsir agree that this Ayah (2: 97-98) was revealed in response to the Jews who claimed that Jibril (Gabriel) is an enemy of the Jews and that Mika'il (Michael) is their friend.'' Al-Bukhari said, "Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä ßóÇäó ÚóÏõæøğÇ áøöÌöÈúÑöíáó</div><br>  (Whoever is an enemy of Jibril (let him die in his fury)). `Ikrimah said, "Jibr, Mik and Israf all mean, worshipper, while il means, Allah''. Anas bin Malik said, "When `Abdullah bin Salam heard of the arrival of the Prophet in Al-Madinah, he was working on his land. He came to the Prophet and said, `I am going to ask you about three things which nobody knows except a Prophet. What will be the first portent of the Hour What will be the first meal taken by the people of Paradise Why does a child resemble its father, and why does it resemble its maternal uncle' Allah's Messenger said, (Jibril has just told me the answers.) `Abdullah said, `He (i.e. Jibril), among all the angels, is the enemy of the Jews.' Allah's Messenger recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä ßóÇäó ÚóÏõæøğÇ áøöÌöÈúÑöíáó İóÅöäøóåõ äóÒøóáóåõ Úóáóì ŞóáúÈößó</div><br>  (Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'an) down to your heart). Allah's Messenger then said, (The first portent of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west; the first meal of the people of Paradise will be the caudate lobe of the liver of fish. As for the child resembling his parents: If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and his discharge is first, the child will resemble the father. If the woman has a discharge first, the child will resemble her side of the family.) On that `Abdullah bin Salam said, `I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and you are the Messenger of Allah.' `Abdullah bin Salam further said, `O Allah's Messenger! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know about my conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they will tell a lie about me.' The Jews came to Allah's Messenger , and `Abdullah went inside the house. Allah's Messenger asked (the Jews), (`What kind of man is `Abdullah bin Salam') They replied, `He is the best among us, the son of the best among us, our master and the son of our master.' Allah's Messenger said, (What do you think if he would embrace Islam) The Jews said, `May Allah save him from it.' Then `Abdullah bin Salam came out in front of them saying, `I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.' Thereupon they said, `He is the evilest among us, and the son of the evilest among us.' And they continued talking badly about him. Ibn Salam said, `This is what I feared, O Messenger of Allah!.''' Only Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith from Anas using another chain of narration.  Some people say that `il' means worshipper while whatever word that is added to it becomes Allah's Name, because `il' is a constant in such conjunction. This is similar to the names `Abdullah, `Abdur-Rahman, `Abdul-Malik, `Abdul-Quddus, `Abdus-Salam, `Abdul-Kafi, `Abdul-Jalil, and so forth. Hence, `Abd' is constant in these compound names, while the remainder differs from name to name. This is the same case with Jibril, Mika'il, `Azra'il, Israfil, and so forth. Allah knows best. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Choosing Some Angels to believe in over Others is Disbelief like choosing Some Prophets over Others</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä ßóÇäó ÚóÏõæøğÇ áøöÌöÈúÑöíáó İóÅöäøóåõ äóÒøóáóåõ Úóáóì ŞóáúÈößó ÈöÅöĞúäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's permission,) meaning, whoever becomes an enemy of Jibril, let him know that he is Ruh Al-Qudus who brought down the Glorious Dhikr (Qur'an) to your heart from Allah by His leave. Hence, he is a messenger from Allah. Whoever takes a messenger as an enemy, will have taken all the messengers as enemies. Further, whoever believes in one messenger, is required to believe in all of the messengers. Whoever rejects one messenger, he has rejected all of the messengers. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóßúİõÑõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóÑõÓõáöåö æóíõÑöíÏõæäó Ãóä íõİóÑøöŞõæÇú Èóíúäó Çááøóåö æóÑõÓõáöåö æóíŞõæáõæäó äõÄúãöäõ ÈöÈóÚúÖò æóäóßúİõÑõ ÈöÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allah and His Messengers (by believing in Allah and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, "We believe in some but reject others.'') (4:150)  Allah decreed that they are disbelievers, because they believe in some Prophets and reject others. This is the same with those who take Jibril as an enemy, because Jibril did not choose missions on his own, but by the command of his Lord,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ äóÊóäóÒøóáõ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÃóãúÑö ÑóÈøößó</div><br>  (And we (angels) descend not except by the command of your Lord) (19: 64), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõ áóÊóäÒöíáõ ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó - äóÒóáó Èöåö ÇáÑøõæÍõ ÇáÇøñãöíäõ - Úóáóì ŞóáúÈößó áöÊóßõæäó ãöäó ÇáúãõäúĞöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And truly, this (the Qur'an) is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists. Which the trustworthy Ruh (Jibril) has brought down. Upon your heart (O Muhammad ) that you may be (one) of the warners) (26:192-194).  Al-Bukhari reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÚóÇÏóì áöí æóáöíøğÇ İóŞóÏú ÈóÇÑóÒóäöí ÈöÇáúÍóÑúÈ»</div><br>  (Allah said, `Whoever takes a friend of Mine as an enemy, will have started a war with Me.)  Therefore, Allah became angry with those who took Jibril as an enemy. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä ßóÇäó ÚóÏõæøğÇ áøöÌöÈúÑöíáó İóÅöäøóåõ äóÒøóáóåõ Úóáóì ŞóáúÈößó ÈöÅöĞúäö Çááøóåö ãõÕóÏøöŞğÇ áøöãóÇ Èóíúäó íóÏóíúåö</div><br>  (Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'an) down to your heart by Allah's permission, confirming what came before it) meaning, the previous Books,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõÏğì æóÈõÔúÑóì áöáúãõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  (and guidance and glad tidings for the believers) meaning, as guidance to their hearts and bringer of the good news of Paradise, which is exclusively for the believers. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú åõÏğì æóÔöİóÂÁñ</div><br>  (Say: "It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.'')

Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä ßóÇäó ÚóÏõæøğÇ áøáøóåö æóãóáÜÆößóÊöåö æóÑõÓõáöåö æóÌöÈúÑöíáó æóãöíßóÜáó İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó ÚóÏõæøñ áøöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó </div><br>  (Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibril and Mika'il (Michael), then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.)  Allah stated that whoever takes Him, His angels and messengers as enemies, then...Allah's messengers include angels and men, for Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ íóÕúØóİöì ãöäó ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö ÑõÓõáÇğ æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (Allah chooses Messengers from angels and from men) (22:75). Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌöÈúÑöíáó æóãöíßóÜáó</div><br>  (Jibril (Gabriel) and Mika'il (Michael)). Allah mentioned Jibril and Mika'il specifically - although they are included among the angels who were messengers - only because this Ayah was meant to support Jibril the emissary between Allah and His Prophets. Allah also mentioned Mika'il here, because the Jews claimed that Jibril was their enemy and Mika'il was their friend. Allah informed them that whoever is an enemy of either of them, then he is also an enemy of the other as well as Allah. We should state here that Mika'il sometimes descended to some of Allah's Prophets, although to a lesser extent than Jibril, because this was primarily Jibril's task, and Israfil is entrusted with the job of blowing the Trumpet for the commencement of Resurrection on the Day of Judgment. It is recorded in the Sahih that whenever the Messenger of Allah would wake up at night, he would supplicate,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó ÑóÈøó ÌöÈúÑóÇÆöíáó æóãöíßóÇÆöíáó æóÅöÓúÑóÇİöíáó İóÇØöÑó ÇáÓøóãóæóÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖö ÚóÇáöãó ÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÇáÔøóåóÇÏóÉö¡ ÃóäúÊó ÊóÍúßõãõ Èóíúäó ÚöÈóÇÏößó İöíãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇ İöíåö íóÎúÊóáöİõæäó¡ ÇåúÏöäöí áöãóÇ ÇÎúÊõáöİó İöíåö ãöäó ÇáúÍóŞøö ÈöÅöĞúäößó Åöäøóßó ÊóåúÏöí ãóäú ÊóÔóÇÁõ Åöáì ÕöÑóÇØò ãõÓúÊóŞöíã»</div><br>  (O Allah, Lord of Jibril, Mika'il and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and earth and Knower of the seen and the unseen!
