Allah then criticized them in the claim that Ibrahim, the Prophets who came after him and the Asbat were following their religion, whether Judaism or Christianity. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÁóÃóäÊõãú ÃóÚúáóãõ Ãóãö Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (Say, "Do you know better or does Allah'') meaning, Allah has the best knowledge and He stated that they were neither Jews, nor Christians.

Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäú ÃóÙúáóãõ ãöãøóäú ßóÊóãó ÔóåóÜÏóÉğ ÚöäÏóåõ ãöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  And who is more unjust than he who conceals the testimony he has from Alla0h¿ )2:140(. Al-Háasan Al-Basári said, They used to recite the Book of Alla0h He sent to them that stated that the true religion is Isla0m and that Muháammad is the Messenger of Alla0h. Their Book also stated that Ibra0h0m, Isma0 0l, Isháa0q, Ya qu0b and the tribes were neither Jews, nor Christians. They testified to these facts, yet hid them from the people. Alla0h s statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ Çááøóåõ ÈöÛóÜİöáò ÚóãøóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (And Allah is not unaware of what you do), is a threat and a warning that His knowledge encompasses every one's deeds, and He shall award each accordingly. Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÃõãøóÉñ ŞóÏú ÎóáóÊú</div><br>  (That was a nation who has passed away.) meaning, existed before you,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåóÇ ãóÇ ßóÓóÈóÊú æóáóßõã ãøóÇ ßóÓóÈúÊõã</div><br>  (They shall receive the reward of what they earned, and you of what you earn.) meaning, they bear their deeds while you bear yours,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊõÓúÜóáõæäó ÚóãøóÇ ßóÇäõæÇ íóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (And you will not be asked of what they used to do) meaning, the fact that you are their relatives will not suffice, unless you imitate their good deeds. Further, do not be deceived by the fact that you are their descendants, unless you imitate them in obeying Allah's orders and following His Messengers who were sent as warners and bearers of good news. Indeed, whoever disbelieves in even one Prophet, will have disbelieved in all the Messengers, especially if one disbelieves in the master and Final Messenger from Allah, the Lord of the worlds, to all mankind and the Jinns. May Allah's peace and blessings be on Muhammad and the rest of Allah's Prophets.  </div></body></html>
