"Verily, this we have been promised -- we and our fathers before! This is only (from) tales of the ancients!'') Allah's saying:</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÃóÎóĞúäóÜåõãú ÈöÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö</div><br>  (And indeed We seized them with punishment,) means, `We tried and tested them with difficulties and calamities.'

Then Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÃóÎóĞúäóÜåõãú ÈöÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö İóãóÇ ÇÓúÊóßóÇäõæÇú</div><br>  (And indeed We seized them with punishment, but they humbled not themselves.) This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i. The basis of this Hadith is in the Two Sahihs, where it says that the Messenger of Allah prayed against the Quraysh when he could not make any headway with them, and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó ÃóÚöäøöí Úóáóíúåöãú ÈöÓóÈúÚò ßóÓóÈúÚö íõæÓõİ»</div><br>  (O Allah, help me against them sending on them seven years (of famine) like the seven (years of drought) of Yusuf.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ İóÊóÍúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ÈóÇÈÇğ ĞóÇ ÚóĞóÇÈò ÔóÏöíÏò ÅöĞóÇ åõãú İöíåö ãõÈúáöÓõæäó </div><br>  (Until, when We open for them the gate of severe punishment, then lo! they will be plunged in despair.) When the command of Allah reaches them and the Hour comes to them suddenly, and they are overtaken by the punishment of Allah which they were not expecting, then they will despair of any ease and goodness, and all their hopes will disappear. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>A reminder of the Blessings of Allah and His immense Power</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah mentions His blessings to His servants, in that He has given them hearing, sight and understanding through which they come to know things and draw lessons from them, the signs which attest to the Oneness of Allah and indicate that He is the One Who does what He wills and chooses what He wants.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóáöíáÇğ ãøóÇ ÊóÔúßõÑõæäó</div><br>  (Little thanks you give.) means, how little you thank Allah for the blessings He has given you. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóßúËóÑõ ÇáäøóÇÓö æóáóæú ÍóÑóÕúÊó ÈöãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) 12:103 Then Allah tells us about His great power and overwhelming authority, for He is the One Who originated creation and put people in all parts of the earth, with their different nations, languages and characteristics, then on the Day of Resurrection He will gather them all together, the first of them and the last, at a fixed time on a day appointed, and none will be left out, young or old, male or female, noble or insignificant, but all will be brought back as they were originally created. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íõÍúìö æóíõãöíÊõ</div><br>  (And it is He Who gives life and causes death,) meaning, He will bring the scattered bones back to life and cause the death of the nations,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóåõ ÇÎúÊöáóÜİõ Çáøóíúáö æóÇáäøóåóÇÑö</div><br>  (and His is the alternation of night and day. ) meaning, by His command night and day are subjugated, each of them following the other and never departing from that pattern, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÇáÔøóãúÓõ íóäÈóÛöì áóåóÂ Ãóä ÊÏúÑößó ÇáŞóãóÑó æóáÇó Çáøóíúáõ ÓóÇÈöŞõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑö</div><br>  (It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day)36:40.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó ÊóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (Will you not then understand) means, do you not have minds that tell you of the Almighty, All-Knowing to Whom all things are subjugated, Who has power over all things and to Whom all things submit <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Idolators thought that Resurrection after Death was very unlikely</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah tells us about those who denied the resurrection, who were like the disbelievers who came before them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ŞóÇáõæÇú ãöËúáó ãóÇ ŞóÇáó ÇáÇøñæøóáõæäó - ŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóÁöĞóÇ ãöÊúäóÇ æóßõäøóÇ ÊõÑóÇÈÇğ æóÚöÙóÜãÇğ ÃóÁöäøóÇ áóãóÈúÚõæËõæäó </div><br>  (Nay, but they say the like of what the men of old said. They said: "When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we be resurrected indeed'') They thought it very unlikely that this would happen after they had disintegrated into nothing.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú æõÚöÏúäóÇ äóÍúäõ æóÁóÇÈóÂÄõäóÇ åóÜĞóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáõ Åöäú åóÜĞóÂ ÅöáÇøó ÃóÓóÜØöíÑõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó </div><br>  ("Verily, this we have been promised -- we and our fathers before (us)! This is only the tales of the ancients!'') This means, "It is impossible that we could be brought back. This was said by those who learned it from the books and disputes of the ancients.'' This denial and rejection on their part is like the Ayah where Allah tells us about them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁöĞóÇ ßõäøóÇ ÚöÙóÜãÇğ äøóÎöÑóÉğ - ŞóÇáõæÇú Êöáúßó ÅöĞÇğ ßóÑøóÉñ ÎóÜÓöÑóÉñ - İóÅöäøóãóÇ åöìó ÒóÌúÑóÉñ æóÍöÏóÉñ - İóÅöĞóÇ åõã ÈöÇáÓøóÇåöÑóÉö </div><br>  ("Even after we are crumbled bones'' They say: "It would in that case, be a return with loss!''
