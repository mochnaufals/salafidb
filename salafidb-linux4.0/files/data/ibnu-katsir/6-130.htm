Did not there come to you Messengers from among you'') We should note here that the Messengers are from among mankind only, not vice versa, as Mujahid, Ibn Jurayj and others from the Imams of Salaf and later generations have stated. The proof for this is that Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ ÃóæúÍóíúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó ßóãóÂ ÃóæúÍóíúäóÂ Åöáóì äõæÍò æóÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåö</div><br>  (Verily, We have sent the revelation to you as We sent the revelation to Nuh and the Prophets after him.) 4:163, until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøõÓõáÇğ ãøõÈóÔøöÑöíäó æóãõäĞöÑöíäó áöÆóáÇøó íóßõæäó áöáäøóÇÓö Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÍõÌøóÉñ ÈóÚúÏó ÇáÑøõÓõáö</div><br>  (Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers.) 4:165  Allah said, concerning the Prophet Ibrahim,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöì ĞõÑøöíøóÊöåö ÇáäøõÈõæøóÉó æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (And We ordained among his offspring prophethood and the Book) 29: 27, thus sending the prophethood and the Book exclusively through the offspring of the Prophet Ibrahim. No one has claimed that there were Prophets from among the Jinns before the time of Ibrahim, but not after that.

When they stood in the presence thereof, they said: "Listen in silence!" And when it was finished, they returned to their people, as warners. They said: "O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa, confirming what came before it, it guides to the truth and to the straight way. O our people! Respond to Allah's caller, and believe in him. He (Allah) will forgive you your sins, and will save you from a painful torment (i.e. Hell-fire). And whosoever does not respond to Allah's caller, he cannot escape on earth, and there will be no helpers for him besides Allah. Those are in manifest error.) 46:29-32 A Hadith collected by At-Tirmidhi stated that the Messenger of Allah recited Surat Ar-Rahman, to these Jinns, in which Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóäóİúÑõÛõ áóßõãú ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáËøóŞóáÇóäö İóÈöÃóìøö ÁóÇáÇÁö ÑóÈøößõãóÇ ÊõßóĞøöÈóÇäö </div><br>  (We shall attend to you, O you two classes (Jinn and men)!

"Did not there come to you Messengers from amongst you, reciting unto you My verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours" They will say: "We bear witness against ourselves.'') meaning, we affirm that the Messengers have conveyed Your Messages to us and warned us about the meeting with You, and that this Day will certainly occur. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÛóÑøóÊúåõãõ ÇáúÍóíóæÉõ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ</div><br>  (It was the life of this world that deceived them.) and they wasted their lives and brought destruction to themselves by rejecting the Messengers and denying their miracles.
