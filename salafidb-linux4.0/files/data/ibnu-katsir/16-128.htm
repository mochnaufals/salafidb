Ibn Sirin said, "If a man among you takes something from you, then you should take something similar from him.'' This was also the opinion of Mujahid, Ibrahim, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, and others. Ibn Jarir also favored this opinion. Ibn Zayd said: "They had been commanded to forgive the idolators, then some men became Muslim who were strong and powerful. They said, `O Messenger of Allah, if only Allah would give us permission, we would sort out these dogs!' Then this Ayah was revealed, then it was latter abrogated by the command to engage in Jihad.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÕúÈöÑú æóãóÇ ÕóÈúÑõßó ÅöáÇøó ÈöÇááøóåö</div><br>  (And be patient, and your patience will not be but by the help of Allah.) This emphasizes the command to be patient and tells us that patience cannot be acquired except by the will, help, decree and power of Allah. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÍúÒóäú Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (And do not grieve over them,) meaning, those who oppose you, for Allah has decreed that this should happen.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó Êóßõ İöì ÖóíúŞò</div><br>  (and do not be distressed) means do not be worried or upset.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöãøóÇ íóãúßõÑõæäó</div><br>  (by their plots.) meaning; because of the efforts they are putting into opposing you and causing you harm, for Allah is protecting, helping, and supporting you, and He will cause you to prevail and defeat them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ãóÚó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÊøóŞóæÇú æøóÇáøóĞöíäó åõã ãøõÍúÓöäõæäó </div><br>  (Truly, Allah is with those who have Taqwa, and the doers of good.) meaning; He is with them in the sense of supporting them, helping them and guiding them. This is a special kind of "being with'', as Allah says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú íõæÍöì ÑóÈøõßó Åöáóì ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö Ãóäøöí ãóÚóßõãú İóËóÈøöÊõæÇú ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú</div><br>  ((Remember) when your Lord revealed to the angels, "Verily, I am with you, so support those who believe.'') 8:12 And Allah said to Musa and Harun:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊóÎóÇİóÂ Åöäøóäöì ãóÚóßõãóÂ ÃóÓúãóÚõ æóÃóÑóì</div><br>  (Fear not, verily I am with you both, hearing and seeing.) 20:46 The Prophet said to (Abu Bakr) As-Siddiq when they were in the cave:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÍúÒóäú Åöäøó Çááåó ãóÚóäóÇ»</div><br>  (Do not worry, Allah is with us.'') The general kind of "being with'' some one, or something is by means of seeing, hearing and knowing, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ãóÚóßõãú Ãóíúäó ãóÇ ßõäÊõãú æóÇááøóåõ ÈöãóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó ÈóÕöíÑñ</div><br>  (And He is with you wherever you may be.

These are the ones whom Allah takes care of, He gives them support, and helps them to prevail over their enemies and opponents. This is end of the Tafsir of Surat An-Nahl. To Allah be praise and blessings, and peace and blessings be upon Muhammad and his family and Companions.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
