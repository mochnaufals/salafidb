We shall follow what we found our fathers following,'' meaning, worshipping the idols and the false deities.

Ibn Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said that this was revealed about a group of Jews whom Allah's Messenger called to Islam, but they refused, saying, "Rather, we shall follow what we found our forefathers following.'' So Allah revealed this Ayah (2:170) above." <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Disbeliever is just like an Animal</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then made a parable of the disbelievers, just as He said in another Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö ãóËóáõ ÇáÓøóæúÁö</div><br>  (For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil description.)

This is what is reported from Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Ata', Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Õõãøñ Èõßúãñ Úõãúìñ</div><br>  (They are deaf, dumb, and blind.) means, they are deaf, as they do not hear the truth; mute, as they do not utter it; and blind, as they do not see or recognize its path and way.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåõãú áÇó íóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (So they do not understand.) means, they do not comprehend or understand anything.  </div></body></html>
