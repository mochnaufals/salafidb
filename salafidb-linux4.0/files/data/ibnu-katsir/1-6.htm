Guide us to the straight path.)</div> <br>This method is more appropriate and efficient in bringing about a positive answer to the pleas, and this is why Allah recommended this better method.  Asking for help may take the form of conveying the condition of the person who is seeking help. For instance, the Prophet Moses said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö Åöäøöì áöãóÂ ÃóäÒóáúÊó Åöáóìøó ãöäú ÎóíúÑò İóŞöíÑñ</div><br>  (My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me!) (28:24).  Also, one may first mention the attributes of whoever is being asked, such as what Dhun-Nun said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó ÃóäÊó ÓõÈúÍóÜäóßó Åöäøöì ßõäÊõ ãöäó ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (La ilaha illa Anta (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah)), Glorified (and Exalted) be You (above all that they associate with You)! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers) (21:87).  Further, one may praise Him without mentioning what he needs. The Meaning of Guidance mentioned in the Surah  The guidance mentioned in the Surah implies being directed and guided to success. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇåúÏöäóÇ ÇáÕøöÑóÇØó ÇáúãõÓúÊóŞöíãó </div><br>  (Guide us to the straight path) meaning guide, direct, lead and grant us the correct guidance. Also,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóÏóíúäóÜåõ ÇáäøóÌúÏóíäö </div><br>  (And shown him the two ways (good and evil)) (90:10), means, `We explained to him the paths of good and evil.' Also, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÌúÊóÈóÜåõ æóåóÏóÇåõ Åöáóì ÕöÑóØò ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò</div><br>  (He (Allah) chose him (as an intimate friend) and guided him to a straight path) (16:121), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇåúÏõæåõãú Åöáóì ÕöÑóØö ÇáúÌóÍöíãö</div><br>  (And lead them on to the way of flaming Fire (Hell)) (37:23). Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóßó áóÊóåúÏöì Åöáóì ÕöÑóØò ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò</div><br>  (And verily, you (O Muhammad ) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the straight path) (42:52), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóãúÏõ áöáøóåö ÇáøóĞöì åóÏóÇäóÇ áöåóÜĞóÇ</div><br>  (All praise and thanks be to Allah, Who has guided us to this) (7:43), meaning, guided us and directed us and qualified us for this end - Paradise. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, the Straight Path.</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  As for the meaning of As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, Imam Abu Ja`far At-Tabari said, "The Ummah agreed that Sirat Al-Mustaqim, is the clear path without branches, according to the language of the Arabs. For instance, Jarir bin `Atiyah Al-Khatafi said in a poem, `The Leader of the faithful is on a path that will remain straight even though the other paths are crooked.'' At-Tabari also stated that, "There are many evidences to this fact.'' At-Tabari then proceeded, "The Arabs use the term, Sirat in reference to every deed and statement whether righteous or wicked. Hence the Arabs would describe the honest person as being straight and the wicked person as being crooked. The straight path mentioned in the Qur'an refers to Islam.  Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that An-Nawwas bin Sam`an said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÖóÑóÈó Çááåõ ãóËóáğÇ ÕöÑóÇØğÇ ãõÓúÊóŞöíãğÇ¡ æóÚóáóì ÌóäúÈóÊóíö ÇáÕøöÑóÇØö ÓõæÑóÇäö İöíåöãóÇ ÃóÈúæóÇÈñ ãõİóÊøóÍóÉñ¡ æóÚóáóì ÇáúÃóÈúæóÇÈö ÓõÊõæÑñ ãõÑúÎóÇÉñ¡ æóÚóáóì ÈóÇÈö ÇáÕøöÑóÇØö ÏóÇÚò íóŞõæáõ: íóÇÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÇÏúÎõáõæÇ ÇáÕøöÑóÇØó ÌóãöíÚğÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÚúæóÌøõæÇ¡ æóÏóÇÚò íóÏúÚõæ ãöäú İóæúŞö ÇáÕøöÑóÇØö¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ÃóÑóÇÏó ÇáúÅöäúÓóÇäõ Ãóäú íóİúÊóÍó ÔóíúÆğÇ ãöäú Êöáúßó ÇáúÃóÈúæóÇÈö ŞóÇáó:æóíúÍóßó áóÇ ÊóİúÊóÍúåõ İóÅöäøóßó Åöäú İóÊóÍúÊóåõ ÊóáöÌúåõ İóÇáÕøöÑóÇØõ: ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãõ æóÇáÓøõæÑóÇäö: ÍõÏõæÏõ Çááåö æóÇáúÃóÈúæóÇÈõ ÇáúãõİóÊøóÍóÉõ ãóÍóÇÑöãõ Çááåö æóĞóáößó ÇáÏøóÇÚöí Úóáóì ÑóÃúÓö ÇáÕøöÑóÇØö ßöÊóÇÈõ Çááåö¡ æóÇáÏøóÇÚöí ãöäú İóæúŞö ÇáÕøöÑóÇØö æóÇÚöÙõ Çááåö İöí ŞóáúÈö ßõáøö ãõÓúáöãò»</div><br>  (Allah has set an example: a Sirat (straight path) that is surrounded by two walls on both sides, with several open doors within the walls covered with curtains. There is a caller on the gate of the Sirat who heralds, 'O people! Stay on the path and do not deviate from it.' Meanwhile, a caller from above the path is also warning any person who wants to open any of these doors, 'Woe unto you! Do not open it, for if you open it you will pass through.' The straight path is Islam, the two walls are Allah's set limits, while the doors resemble what Allah has prohibited. The caller on the gate of the Sirat is the Book of Allah, while the caller above the Sirat is Allah's admonishment in the heart of every Muslim.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Faithful ask for and abide by Guidance</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  If someone asks, "Why does the believer ask Allah for guidance during every prayer and at other times, while he is already properly guided Has he not already acquired guidance''  The answer to these questions is that if it were not a fact that the believer needs to keep asking for guidance day and night, Allah would not have directed him to invoke Him to acquire the guidance. The servant needs Allah the Exalted every hour of his life to help him remain firm on the path of guidance and to make him even more firm and persistent on it. The servant does not have the power to benefit or harm himself, except by Allah's permission. Therefore, Allah directed the servant to invoke Him constantly, so that He provides him with His aid and with firmness and success. Indeed, the happy person is he whom Allah guides to ask of Him. This is especially the case if a person urgently needs Allah's help day or night. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÁóÇãöäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö æóÑóÓõæáöåö æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈö ÇáøóĞöì äóÒøóáó Úóáóì ÑóÓõæáöåö æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈö ÇáøóĞöì ÃóäóÒáó ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (O you who believe! Believe in Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad ), and the Book (the Qur'an) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him)) (4:16).  Therefore, in this Ayah Allah commanded the believers to believe, and this command is not redundant since what is sought here is firmness and continuity of performing the deeds that help one remain on the path of faith. Also, Allah commanded His believing servants to proclaim,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÇ áÇó ÊõÒöÛú ŞõáõæÈóäóÇ ÈóÚúÏó ÅöĞú åóÏóíúÊóäóÇ æóåóÈú áóäóÇ ãöä áøóÏõäßó ÑóÍúãóÉğ Åöäøóßó ÃóäÊó ÇáúæóåøóÇÈõ </div><br>  (Our Lord!
