Then We sent Musa and his brother Harun, with Our Ayat and manifest authority,) (46. To Fir`awn and his chiefs, but they behaved insolently and they were people self-exalting (by disobeying their Lord).) (47. They said: "Shall we believe in two men like ourselves, and their people are obedient to us with humility!'') (48. So, they denied them both and became of those who were destroyed.) (49.

They were of a similar mentality, so Allah destroyed Fir`awn and his chiefs, drowning them all in one day. He revealed the Book to Musa, i.e., the Tawrah, in which were rulings, commands and prohibitions, after He had destroyed Fir`awn and the Egyptians and seized them with a punishment of the All-Mighty, All-Capable to carry out what He wills. After Allah revealed the Tawrah, Allah did not destroy any nation with an overwhelming calamity; instead, He commanded the believers to fight the disbelievers, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÁóÇÊóíúäóÇ ãõæÓóì ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÂ ÃóåúáóßúäóÇ ÇáúŞõÑõæäó ÇáÇøòæáóì ÈóÕóÂÆöÑó áöáäøóÇÓö æóåõÏğì æóÑóÍúãóÉğ áøóÚóáøóåõãú íóÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó </div><br>  (And indeed We gave Musa -- after We had destroyed the generations of old -- the Scripture as an enlightenment for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, that they might remember.) 28:43</div>  </div></body></html>
