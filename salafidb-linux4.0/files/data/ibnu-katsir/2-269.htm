Ibn `Abbas said, "Allah commanded them to spend from the purest, finest and best types of their money and prohibited spending from evil and dishonest money, because Allah is pure and good and only accepts that which is pure and good.'' This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóíóãøóãõæÇú ÇáúÎóÈöíËó</div><br>  (and do not aim at that which is bad) meaning, filthy (impure) money,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöäúåõ ÊõäİöŞõæäó æóáóÓúÊõã ÈöÃóÎöĞöíåö</div><br>  (to spend from it, (though) you would not accept it) meaning, "If you were given this type, you would not take it, except if you tolerate the deficiency in it. Verily, Allah is far Richer than you, He is in no need of this money, so do not give, for His sake, what you would dislike for yourselves.'' It was reported that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóíóãøóãõæÇú ÇáúÎóÈöíËó ãöäúåõ ÊõäİöŞõæäó</div><br>  (and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it) means, "Do not spend from the dishonest, impure money instead of the honest, pure money.''  Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Bara' bin `Azib commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÃóäİöŞõæÇú ãöä ØóíøöÈóÜÊö ãóÇ ßóÓóÈúÊõãú æóãöãøóÂ ÃóÎúÑóÌúäóÇ áóßõã ãøöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóáÇó ÊóíóãøóãõæÇú ÇáúÎóÈöíËó ãöäúåõ ÊõäİöŞõæäó</div><br>  (O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned, and of that which We have produced from the earth for you, and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it,) that it was revealed about the Ansar. When the season for harvesting date-trees would start, the Ansar would collect ripe-date branches from their gardens and hang them on a rope erected between two pillars in the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah. The poor emigrant Companions would eat from these dates. However, some of them (Ansar) would also add lesser type of dates in between ripe-date branches, thinking they are allowed to do so. Allah revealed this Ayah about those who did this,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóíóãøóãõæÇú ÇáúÎóÈöíËó ãöäúåõ ÊõäİöŞõæäó</div><br>  (and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it.)  `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÓúÊõã ÈöÃóÎöĞöíåö ÅöáÇó Ãóä ÊõÛúãöÖõæÇú İöíåö</div><br>  (you would not accept it save if you close your eyes and tolerate therein) means, "If you had a right on someone who would pay you less than what you gave them, you would not agree until you require more from them to make up the difference. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇó Ãóä ÊõÛúãöÖõæÇú İöíåö</div><br>  (save if you close your eyes and tolerate therein) meaning, `How do you agree for Me what you do not agree for yourselves, while I have a right to the best and most precious of your possessions'' Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded this Hadith and Ibn Jarir added, "And this is the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä ÊóäóÇáõæÇú ÇáúÈöÑøó ÍóÊøóì ÊõäİöŞõæÇú ãöãøóÇ ÊõÍöÈøõæäó</div><br>  (By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend of that which you love)'' 4:92  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÚúáóãõæÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó Ûóäöíøñ ÍóãöíÏñ</div><br>  (And know that Allah is Rich (free of all needs), and worthy of all praise) meaning, "Although Allah commanded you to give away the purest of your money in charity, He is far Richer from needing your charity, but the purpose is that the distance between the rich and the poor becomes less.'' Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä íóäóÇáó Çááøóåó áõÍõæãõåóÇ æóáÇó ÏöãóÂÄõåóÇ æóáóÜßöä íóäóÇáõåõ ÇáÊøóŞúæóì ãöäßõãú</div><br>  (It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him) 22:37.  Allah is Rich and free of needing anything from any of His creatures, while all of His creatures stand in need of Him. Allah's bounty encompassing, and what He has never ends. Therefore, whoever gives away good and pure things in charity, let him know that Allah is the Most Rich, His favor is enormous and He is Most Generous, Most Compassionate; and He shall reward him for his charity and multiply it many times. So who would lend to He Who is neither poor nor unjust, Who is worthy of all praise in all His actions, statements, and decisions, of Whom there is neither a deity worthy of worship except Him, nor a Lord other than Him <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Shaytanic Doubts Concerning Spending in Charity</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ íóÚöÏõßõãõ ÇáúİóŞúÑó æóíóÃúãõÑõßõã ÈöÇáúİóÍúÔóÂÁö æóÇááøóåõ íóÚöÏõßõã ãøóÛúİöÑóÉğ ãøöäúåõ æóİóÖúáÇğ æóÇááøóåõ æóÓöÚñ Úóáöíãñ </div><br>  (Shaytan threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit Fahsha'; whereas Allah promises you forgiveness from Himself and bounty, and Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower.)

As for the effect of Shaytan, it is by his threatening with evil repercussions and rejecting the truth. As for the effect of the angel, it is by his promise of a good end and believing in the truth. Whoever finds the latter, let him know that it is coming from Allah and let him thank Allah for it. Whoever finds the former, let him seek refuge - with Allah - from Shaytan.)
