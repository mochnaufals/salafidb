Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚöÈóÇÏöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú Åöäøó ÃóÑúÖöì æóÇÓöÚóÉñ İóÅöíøóÇìó İóÇÚúÈõÏõæäö </div><br>  (O My servants who believe! Certainly, spacious is My earth. Therefore worship Me.) When things became too difficult for the believers in Makkah who were in a weak position and were oppressed, they left and migrated to Ethiopia, where they were able to practice their religion. The Muslims found Ethiopia the best place for guest; where Ashamah, the Negus or king, may Allah have mercy on him, gave them refuge, helped them, supported them, and honored them in his land. Later, the Messenger of Allah and his remaining Companions migrated to Al-Madinah, formerly known as Yathrib, may Allah protect it. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøõ äóİúÓò ĞóÂÆöŞóÉõ ÇáúãóæúÊö Ëõãøó ÅöáóíúäóÇ ÊõÑúÌóÚõæäó </div><br>  (Everyone shall taste death. Then unto Us you shall be returned.) meaning, `wherever you are, death with catch up with you, so always obey Allah and be where Allah commands you to be, for this is better for you. Death is inevitable and there is no escape from it, and then you will return to Allah, and whoever was obedient to Him will have the best reward.' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö áóäõÈóæøöÆóäøóåõãú ãøöäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÛõÑóİóÇğ ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÇ ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ</div><br>  (And those who believe and do righteous good deeds, to them We shall surely give lofty dwellings in Paradise, underneath which rivers flow,) meaning, `We shall cause them to dwell in lofty homes in Paradise under which various kinds of rivers flow -- water, wine, honey and milk -- which they can direct and cause to flow wherever they wish.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÂ</div><br>  (to live therein forever.) means, they will remain there forever, never wanting to leave.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äöÚúãó ÃóÌúÑõ ÇáúÚóÜãöáöíäó</div><br>  (Excellent is the reward for the workers.) these rooms will be a blessed reward for the good deeds of the believers,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÕóÈóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (Those who are patient,) in adhering to their religion, who migrated for the sake of Allah and fought the enemy, leaving behind their families and relatives to seek Allah's Face, and hoping for that which is with Him, believing His promise. Ibn Abi Hatim, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded from Abu Mu`aniq Al-Ash`ari that Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari told him that the Messenger of Allah told him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÛõÑóİğÇ íõÑóì ÙóÇåöÑõåóÇ ãöäú ÈóÇØöäöåóÇ¡ æóÈóÇØöäõåóÇ ãöäú ÙóÇåöÑöåóÇ¡ ÃóÚóÏøóåóÇ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì áöãóäú ÃóØúÚóãó ÇáØøóÚóÇãó¡ æóÃóØóÇÈó ÇáúßóáóÇãó¡ æóÊóÇÈóÚó ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó æóÇáÕøöíóÇãó¡ æóŞóÇãó ÈöÇááøóíúáö æóÇáäøóÇÓõ äöíóÇã»</div><br>  (In Paradise there are rooms whose outside can be seen from the inside, and their inside can be seen from the outside; Allah has prepared them for those who feed others, who speak well, who pray and fast continually, and who stand in prayer at night while people are asleep.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóáóì ÑóÈøöåöãú íóÊóæóßøóáõæäó</div><br>  (and put their trust in their Lord.) in all their affairs, spiritual and worldly alike. Then Allah tells us that provision is not limited only to one place, but it is given to all His creatures no matter where they are. Indeed, when the Muhajirin migrated, their provision was greater and better than before, because after a short time they became rulers in the land, in all regions. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÃóíøöä ãøöä ÏóÂÈøóÉò áÇøó ÊóÍúãöáõ ÑöÒúŞóåóÇ</div><br>  (And so many a moving creature carries not its own provision!) meaning, it does not have the ability to gather its provision and save it for tomorrow.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ íóÑúÒõŞõåóÇ æóÅöíøóÇßõãú</div><br>  (Allah provides for it and for you.) means, Allah allots its provision to it even though it is weak, and makes it easy for it. He sends provision to every creature in the appropriate manner, even the ants in the depths of the earth, the birds in the air and the fish in the sea. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ãöä ÏóÂÈøóÉò İöí ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöáÇøó Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÑöÒúŞõåóÇ æóíóÚúáóãõ ãõÓúÊóŞóÑøóåóÇ æóãõÓúÊóæúÏóÚóåóÇ ßõáøñ İöì ßöÊóÇÈò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  (And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit. All is in a Clear Book.) (11:6)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáÓøóãöíÚõ ÇáúÚóáöíãõ</div><br>  (And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.) means, He hears all that His servants say and He knows their every movements.  </div></body></html>
