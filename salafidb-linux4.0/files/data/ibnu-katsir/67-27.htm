Allah rebukes them for what they believe, and He informs them that they will not attain that which they hope for. Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãøóäú åóÜĞóÇ ÇáøóĞöì åõæó ÌõäÏñ áøóßõãú íóäÕõÑõßõãú ãøöä Ïõæäö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö</div><br>  (Who is it besides the Most Gracious that can be an army to you to help) imeaning, there is no protector or helper for you besides Him. This is the reason that Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäö ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó ÅöáÇøó İöì ÛõÑõæÑò</div><br>  (The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion.)

This proves that they know this, yet they still worship others besides Him. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóá áøóÌøõæÇú</div><br>  (Nay, but they continue) meaning, they persist in their transgression, lying and misguidance.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÚõÊõæøò æóäõİõæÑò</div><br>  (to be in pride, and flee.) meaning, they continue in obstinance, arrogance and fleeing away from the truth.

So the condition of the disbeliever is like one who walks prone on his face. This is like a person walking bent over on his face (with his head down) instead of walking upright. This person does not know where he is going or how. Rather, he is lost, astray and confused. Is this person more guided,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãøóä íóãúÔöì ÓóæöíøÇğ</div><br>  (or he who walks upright) meaning, he who stands erect.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóì ÕöÑóØò ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò </div><br>  (on a straight path) meaning, this person who walks upright is on a clear path, and he is straight within himself while his path is straight as well. This is their likeness in this world, and their likeness will be the same in the Hereafter. So the believer will be gathered (on the Day of Judgement) walking upright upon the straight path and the vast and spacious Paradise will be opened up for him. However, the disbeliever will be gathered walking down on his face to the Hellfire.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÍúÔõÑõæÇú ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú æóÃóÒúæóÌóåõãú æóãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúÈõÏõæäó - ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö İóÇåúÏõæåõãú Åöáóì ÕöÑóØö ÇáúÌóÍöíãö </div><br>  (Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions and what they used to worship instead of Allah, and lead them on to the way of flaming Fire.) (37:22,23) "Companions'' here means those like them. Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas bin Malik that it was said, "O Messenger of Allah! How will the people be gathered on their faces'' So the Prophet replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóíúÓó ÇáøóĞöí ÃóãúÔóÇåõãú Úóáóì ÃóÑúÌõáöåöãú ŞóÇÏöÑğÇ Úóáóì Ãóäú íõãúÔöíóåõãú Úóáóì æõÌõæåöåöã»</div><br>  (Is not He who made them to walk on their legs able to make them walk on their faces'') This Hadith is also recorded in the Two Sahihs. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah's Power to create and It being an Evidence of the Final Abode</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÃóäÔóÃóßõãú</div><br>  (Say it is He Who has created you,) meaning, He initiated your creation after you were not even a thing worth mentioning (i.e., nothing).

He will gather you all just as He separated you and He will bring you back again just as He originated you. Then while informing of the disbelievers who reject the final return, and doubt concerning its real occurrence, Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæäó ãóÊóì åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúæóÚúÏõ Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó </div><br>  (They say: "When will this promise come to pass if you are telling the truth'') meaning, `when will this gathering after separation that you are informing us of, occur'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáúÚöáúãõ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Say: "The knowledge is with Allah only...'') meaning, `no one knows the time of the Day of Judgement exactly except Allah, but He has commanded me to inform you that it is real and it will definitely occur, so beware of it.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóäóÇú äóĞöíÑñ ãøõÈöíäñ</div><br>  (and I am only a plain warner.) meaning, `I am only obligated to convey, and verily I have performed my duty (of conveying) towards you.'

So, when what they denied occurs, it will grieve them because they will know what is awaiting them there (in Hell) of the worst evil. This means that it will surround them and Allah will command what they were not able to reckon or fully comprehend to come to them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú Ãóäøó áöáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú ãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÌóãöíÚÇğ æóãöËúáóåõ ãóÚóåõ áÇóİúÊóÏóæúÇú Èöåö ãöä ÓõæÁö ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö æóÈóÏóÇ áóåõãú ãøöäó Çááøóåö ãóÇ áóãú íóßõæäõæÇú íóÍúÊóÓöÈõæäó - æóÈóÏóÇ áóåõãú ÓóíøöÆóÇÊõ ãóÇ ßóÜÓóÈõæÇú æóÍóÇŞó Èöåöã ãøóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú Èöåö íóÓúÊóåúÒöÁõæäó </div><br>  (and there will become apparent to them from Allah what they had not been reckoning.
