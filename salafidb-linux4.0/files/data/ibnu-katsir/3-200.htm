These qualities exist in some of the Jews, but only a few of them. For instance, less than ten Jewish rabbis embraced the Islamic faith, such as `Abdullah bin Salam. Many among the Christians, on the other hand, embraced the Islamic faith.

When Ja`far bin Abi Talib recited Surah Maryam chapter 19 to An-Najashi, King of Ethiopia, in the presence of Christian priests and patriarchs, he and they cried until their beards became wet from crying. The Two Sahihs record that when An-Najashi died, the Prophet conveyed the news to his Companions and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÃóÎğÇ áóßõãú ÈöÇáúÍóÈóÔóÉö ŞóÏú ãóÇÊó¡ İóÕóáøõæÇ Úóáóíúå»</div><br>  (A brother of yours from Ethiopia has passed, come to offer the funeral prayer.) He went out with the Companions to the Musalla lined them up in rows, and after that led the prayer.  Ibn Abi Najih narrated that Mujahid said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ãøöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö</div><br>  (And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture), refers to those among them who embraced Islam. `Abbad bin Mansur said that he asked Al-Hasan Al-Basri about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö áóãóä íõÄúãöäõ ÈöÇááøóåö</div><br>  (And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture, those who believe in Allah).  Al-Hasan said, "They are the People of the Book, before Muhammad was sent, who believed in Muhammad and recognized Islam. Allah gave them a double reward, for the faith that they had before Muhammad , and for believing in Muhammad (after he was sent as Prophet).'' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded both of these statements. The Two Sahihs record that Abu Musa said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ËóáóÇËóÉñ íõÄúÊóæúäó ÃóÌúÑóåõãú ãóÑøóÊóíúä»</div><br>  (Three persons will acquire a double reward. )  He mentioned among them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÑóÌõáñ ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúßöÊóÇÈö Âãóäó ÈöäóÈöíøöåö æóÂãóäó Èöí»</div><br>  (A person from among the People of the Book who believed in his Prophet and in me.)

Rather, they share the knowledge without a price, and this is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáÜÆößó áóåõãú ÃóÌúÑõåõãú ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÓóÑöíÚõ ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈö</div><br>  (for them is a reward with their Lord. surely, Allah is Swift in account.)  Mujahid commented on the verse,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÑöíÚõ ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈö</div><br>  ((Surely, Allah is) swift in account), "He is swift in reckoning,'' as Ibn Abi Hatim and others have recorded from him. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command for Patience and Ribat</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÇÕúÈöÑõæÇú æóÕóÇÈöÑõæÇú æóÑóÇÈöØõæÇú</div><br>  (O you who believe! Endure and be more patient, and Rabitu) 3:200.  Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "The believers are commanded to be patient in the religion that Allah chose for them, Islam. They are not allowed to abandon it in times of comfort or hardship, ease or calamity, until they die as Muslims. They are also commanded to endure against their enemies, those who hid the truth about their religion.'' Similar explanation given by several other scholars among the Salaf.  As for Murabatah, it is to endure in acts of worship and perseverence. It also means to await prayer after prayer, as Ibn `Abbas, Sahl bin Hanif and Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi stated. Ibn Abi Hatim collected a Hadith that was also collected by Muslim and An-Nasa'i from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ÃõÎúÈöÑõßõãú ÈöãóÇ íóãúÍõæ Çááåõ Èöåö ÇáúÎóØóÇíóÇ¡ æóíóÑúİóÚõ Èöåö ÇáÏøóÑóÌóÇÊö¿ ÅöÓúÈÇÛõ ÇáæõÖõæÁö Úóáóì ÇáúãóßóÇÑöåö¡ æóßóËúÑóÉõ ÇáúÎõØóÇ Åöáóì ÇáúãóÓóÇÌöÏö¡ æóÇäúÊöÙóÇÑõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö ÈóÚúÏó ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö¡ İóĞáößõãõ ÇáÑøöÈóÇØõ¡ İóĞáößõãõ ÇáÑøöÈóÇØõ¡ İóĞáößõãõ ÇáÑøöÈóÇØ»</div><br>  (Should I tell you about actions with which Allah forgives sins and raises the grade Performing perfect ablution in unfavorable conditions, the many steps one takes to the Masajid, and awaiting prayer after the prayer, for this is the Ribat, this is the Ribat, this is the Ribat.)  They also say that the Murabatah in the above Ayah refers to battles against the enemy, and manning Muslim outposts to protect them from enemy incursions inside Muslim territory. There are several Hadiths that encourage Murabatah and mention its rewards. Al-Bukhari recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑöÈóÇØõ íóæúãò İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö ÎóíúÑñ ãöäó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóãóÇ ÚóáóíúåóÇ»</div><br>  (A Day of Ribat in the cause of Allah is better than this life and all that is in it.)  Muslim recorded that Salman Al-Farisi said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑöÈóÇØõ íóæúãò æóáóíúáóÉò ÎóíúÑñ ãöäú ÕöíóÇãö ÔóåúÑò æóŞöíÇãöåö¡ æóÅöäú ãóÇÊó ÌóÑóì Úóáóíúåö Úóãóáõåõ ÇáøóĞöí ßóÇäó íóÚúãóÜÜÜÜÜÜÜáõåõ¡ æóÃõÌúÑöíó Úóáóíúåö ÑöÒúŞõÜÜÜÜåõ¡ æóÃóãöäó ÇáúİóÊøóÇä»</div><br>  (Ribat for a day and a night is better than fasting the days of a month and its Qiyam (voluntary prayer at night). If one dies in Ribat, his regular righteous deeds that he used to perform will keep being added to his account, and he will receive his provision, and will be saved from the trials of the grave.)  Imam Ahmad recorded that Fadalah bin `Ubayd said that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáøõ ãóíøöÊò íõÎúÊóãõ Úóáì Úóãóáöåö ÅöáøóÇ ÇáøóĞöí ãóÇÊó ãõÑóÇÈöØğÇ İöí ÓóÈöíá Çááåö¡İóÅöäøóåõ íóäúãöí áóåõ Úóãóáõåõ Åöáì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ æóíóÃúãóäõ İöÊúäóÉó ÇáúŞóÈúÑ»</div><br>  (Every dead person will have his record of deeds sealed, except for whoever dies while in Ribat in the cause of Allah, for his work will keep increasing until the Day of Resurrection, and he will be safe from the trial of the grave.)  This is the same narration collected by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who said, "Hasan Sahih''. Ibn Hibban also collected this Hadith in his Sahih. fAt-Tirmidhi recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÚóíúäóÇäö áóÇ ÊóãóÓøõåõãóÇ ÇáäøóÇÑõ: Úóíúäñ ÈóßóÊú ãöäú ÎóÔúíóÉö Çááåö¡ æóÚóíúäñ ÈóÇÊóÊú ÊóÍúÑõÓõ İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááå»</div><br>  (Two eyes shall not be touched by the Fire: an eye that cried for fear from Allah and an eye that spent the night guarding in Allah's cause.)  Al-Bukhari recorded in his Sahih that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóÚöÓó ÚóÈúÏõÇáÏøöíäóÇÑö æóÚóÈúÏõÇáÏøöÑúåóãö æóÚóÈúÏõÇáúÎóãöíÕóÉö¡ Åöäú ÃõÚúØöíó ÑóÖöíó¡ æóÅöäú áóãú íõÚúØó ÓóÎöØó¡ ÊóÚöÓó æóÇäúÊóßóÓó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ Ôöíßó İóáóÇ ÇäúÊóŞóÔó¡ ØõæÈóì áöÚóÈúÏò ÂÎöĞò ÈöÚöäóÇäö İóÑóÓöåö İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö¡ ÃóÔúÚóËó ÑóÃúÓõåõ¡ ãõÛúÈóÑøóÉò ŞóÏóãóÇåõ¡ Åöäú ßóÇäó İöí ÇáúÍöÑóÇÓóÉö ßóÇäó İöí ÇáúÍöÑóÇÓóÉö¡ æóÅöäú ßóÇäó İöí ÇáÓøóÇŞóÉö ßóÇäó İöí ÇáÓøóÇŞóÉö¡ Åöäö ÇÓúÊóÃúĞóäó áóãú íõÄúĞóäú áóåõ¡ æóÅöäú ÔóİóÚó áóãú íõÔóİøóÚ»</div><br>  (Let the servant of the Dinar, the servant of the Dirham and the servant of the Khamisah (of clothes) perish, as he is pleased if these things are given to him, and if not, he is displeased. Let such a person perish and be humiliated, and if he is pierced with a thorn, let him not find anyone to take it out for him. Paradise is for him who holds the reins of his horse, striving in Allah's cause, with his hair unkempt and feet covered with dust: if he is appointed to the vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied with his post of guarding, and if he is appointed in the rearguard, he accepts his post with satisfaction; if he asks for permission he is not permitted, and if he intercedes, his intercession is not accepted.)  Ibn Jarir recorded that Zayd bin Aslam said, "Abu `Ubaydah wrote to `Umar bin Al-Khattab and mentioned to him that the Romans were mobilizing their forces. `Umar wrote back, `Allah will soon turn whatever hardship a believing servant suffers, to ease, and no hardship shall ever overcome two types of ease.

Endure and be more patient, and Rabitu, and have Taqwa of Allah, so that you may be successful)' 3:200."  Al-Hafiz Ibn `Asakir mentioned in the biography of `Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak, that Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Abi Sakinah said, "While in the area of Tarsus, `Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak dictated this poem to me when I was greeting him goodbye. He sent the poem with me to Al-Fudayl bin `Iyad in the year one hundred and seventy, `O he who worships in the vicinity of the Two Holy Masjids! If you but see us, you will realize that you are only jesting in worship. He who brings wetness to his cheek with his tears, should know that our necks are being wet by our blood. He who tires his horses without purpose, know that our horses are getting tired in battle. Scent of perfume is yours, while our scent is the glimmer of spears and the stench of dust in battle. We were narrated about in the speech of our Prophet, an authentic statement that never lies. That the dust that erupts by Allah's horses and which fills the nostrils of a man shall never be combined with the smoke of a raging Fire. This, the Book of Allah speaks among us that the martyr is not dead, and the truth in Allah's Book cannot be denied.' I met Al-Fudayl Ibn `Iyad in the Sacred Masjid and gave him the letter. When he read it, his eyes became tearful and he said, `Abu `Abdur-Rahman (`Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak) has said the truth and offered sincere advice to me.' He then asked me, `Do you write the Hadith' I said, `Yes.' He said, `Write this Hadith as reward for delivering the letter of Abu `Abdur-Rahman to me. He then dictated, `Mansur bin Al-Mu`tamir narrated to us that Abu Salih narrated from Abu Hurayrah that a man asked, `O Messenger of Allah! Teach me a good deed that will earn me the reward of the Mujahidin in Allah's cause.' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóáú ÊóÓúÊóØöíÚõ Ãóäú ÊõÕóáøöíó İóáóÇ ÊóİúÊõÑó¡æóÊóÕõæãó İóáóÇ ÊõİúØöÑó¿»</div><br>  (Are you able to pray continuously and fast without breaking the fast) The man said, `O Messenger of Allah!

Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó</div><br>  (and have Taqwa of Allah), concerning all your affairs and situations.

Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊõİúáöÍõæäó</div><br>  (so that you may be successful.), in this life and the Hereafter. Ibn Jarir recorded that Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said that, Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊõİúáöÍõæäó</div><br>  (and have Taqwa of Allah, so that you may be successful.) means, "Fear Me concerning what is between you and Me, so that you may acquire success when you meet Me tomorrow.''  The Tafsir of Surah Al `Imran ends here, all praise is due to Allah, and we ask Him that we die while on the path of the Qur'an and Sunnah, Amin.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
