After the battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb, the commander of the idolators at that time, inquired about the Prophet , Abu Bakr, and `Umar, may Allah be pleased with them. When he heard no response, he announced: "Verily, those three have died!'' `Umar then responded to him: "You lie, O enemy of Allah! Allah has indeed saved those who will displease you. Indeed, those whom you mentioned are all alive!'' Abu Sufyan then said: "Well, today makes up for (the defeat on) the day of Badr, and the war has its ups and downs. And indeed, you are going to find mutilation (in the bodies of your dead) that I did not command, nor did I prohibit.'' Then he turned around chanting: "Glory to Hubal (their greatest idol), Glory to Hubal.'' Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ÊõÌöíÈõæåõ¿»</div><br>  (Aren't you going to respond to him) The Companions said: "What should we say, O Messenger of Allah'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>« ŞõæáõæÇ: Çááåõ ÃóÚúáóì æóÃóÌóá»</div><br>  (Say: "Allah is Most High and Most Glorious.'')

They have no concern other than that. Thus, it has been confirmed in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúãõÄúãöäõ íóÃúßõáõ İöí ãöÚìğ æóÇÍöÏò¡ æóÇáúßóÇİöÑõ íóÃúßõáõ İöí ÓóÈúÚóÉö ÃóãúÚóÇÁ»</div><br>  (A believer eats with one intestine, and a disbeliever eats with seven intestines.)

If Allah had destroyed the previous nations because of their denial of their Messengers, what then would those (people of Makkah) expect that Allah would do to them in the worldly life and the Hereafter And if the torment were to be lifted off some of them in this life by the blessing of the presence of the Messenger, the Prophet of Mercy, the torment will be stored for them in their next life, as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÖóÇÚóİõ áóåõãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÓúÊóØöíÚõæäó ÇáÓøóãúÚó æóãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íõÈúÕöÑõæäó</div><br>  (Their torment will be doubled!

(11:20) Concerning Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöä ŞóÑúíóÊößó ÇáøóÊöì ÃóÎúÑóÌóÊúßó</div><br>  (than Your town that has driven you out) This means, `its people who have driven you (Muhammad ) out from amongst them (the people of Makkah).' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that when Allah's Messenger left Makkah (at the time of Hijrah -- migration), and he reached the cave and hid inside it, he looked back toward Makkah and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÊö ÃóÍóÈøõ ÈöáóÇÏö Çááåö Åöáóì Çááåö¡ æóÃóäúÊö ÃóÍóÈøõ ÈöáóÇÏö Çááåö Åöáóíøó¡ æóáóæúáóÇ Ãóäøó ÇáúãõÔúÑößöíäó ÃóÎúÑóÌõæäöí áóãú ÃóÎúÑõÌú ãöäúß»</div><br>  (You are the most beloved to Allah among Allah's lands, and you are also the most beloved to me among Allah's lands. Were it not that the idolators have driven me out from you, I would never have left you.) Ibn `Abbas then said, "The worst of enemies is he who transgresses against Allah in His own sacred place, who kills a person who is not trying to kill him, or who kills because of Jahiliyyah vengeance. Allah then revealed to His Prophet ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÃóíøöä ãøöä ŞóÑúíóÉò åöìó ÃóÔóÏøõ ŞõæøóÉğ ãøöä ŞóÑúíóÊößó ÇáøóÊöì ÃóÎúÑóÌóÊúßó ÃóåúáóßúäóÜåõãú İóáÇó äóÜÕöÑó áóåõãú </div><br>  (And how many a town mightier than your town that has driven you out have We destroyed, with none to help them!)''  </div></body></html>
