For Allah created them after they had been nothing at all, then they came into existence and became people who could hear and see. The One Who originated this is able to repeat it, it is very easy for Him. Then he taught them to contemplate the visible signs on the horizons and the things that Allah has created: the heavens with their stars and planets, moving and stationary, the earth with its plains and mountains, its valleys, deserts and wildernesses, trees and rivers, fruits and oceans. All of that indicates that these are themselves created things, and that there must be a Creator Who does as He chooses, Who merely says to a thing "Be!'' and it is. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæóáóãú íóÑóæúÇú ßóíúİó íõÈúÏöìÁõ Çááøóåõ ÇáúÎóáúŞó Ëõãøó íõÚöíÏõåõ Åöäøó Ğáößó Úóáóì Çááøóåö íóÓöíÑñ </div><br>  (See they not how Allah originates the creation, then repeats it.

None can question Him about what He does; rather it is they who will be questioned, for His is the power to create and to command, and whatever He decides is fair and just, for He is the sovereign who cannot be unjust in the slightest.
