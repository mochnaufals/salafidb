He tells us about the Children of Israel, who were the bearers of the Tawrah and Injil.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóßúËóÑó ÇáøóĞöì åõãú İöíåö íóÎúÊóáöİõæäó</div><br>  (most of that in which they differ.) such as their different opinions about `Isa. The Jews lied about him while the Christians exaggerated in praise for him, so the Qur'an came with the moderate word of truth and justice: that he was one of the servants of Allah, and one of His noble Prophets and Messengers, may the best of peace and blessings be upon him, as the Qur'an says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó ÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäõ ãóÑúíóãó Şóæúáó ÇáúÍóŞøö ÇáøóĞöì İöíåö íóãúÊõÑõæäó </div><br>  (Such is `Isa, son of Maryam. (It is) a statement of truth, about which they doubt) (19:34).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõ áóåõÏğì æóÑóÍúãóÉñ áøöáúãõÄãöäöíäó </div><br>  (And truly, it is a guide and a mercy for the believers.) meaning, it is guidance for the hearts of those who believe in it, and a mercy to them. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÑóÈøóßó íóŞúÖöì Èóíúäóåõã</div><br>  (Verily, your Lord will decide between them) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÍõßúãöåö æóåõæó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ</div><br>  (by His judgement. And He is the All-Mighty,) means, in His vengeance,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÚóáöíãõ</div><br>  (the All-Knowing.) Who knows all that His servants do and say. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to put One's Trust in Allah and to convey the Message</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóæóßøóáú Úóáóì Çááøóåö</div><br>  (So, put your trust in Allah;) in all your affairs, and convey the Message of your Lord.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßó Úóáóì ÇáúÍóŞøö ÇáúãõÈöíäö</div><br>  (surely, you are on manifest truth.) meaning, you are following manifest truth, even though you are opposed by those who oppose you because they are doomed. The Word of your Lord has been justified against them, so that they will not believe even if all the signs are brought to them. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßó áÇó ÊõÓúãöÚõ ÇáúãóæúÊóì</div><br>  (Verily, you cannot make the dead to hear) meaning, you cannot cause them to hear anything that will benefit them. The same applies to those over whose hearts is a veil and in whose ears is deafness of disbelief. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊõÓúãöÚõ ÇáÕøõãøó ÇáÏøõÚóÂÁó ÅöĞóÇ æóáøóæúÇú ãõÏúÈöÑöíäó</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóäÊó ÈöåóÇÏöì ÇáúÚõãúìö Úóä ÖóáóÜáóÊöåöãú Åöä ÊõÓúãöÚõ ÅöáÇøó ãóä íõÄúãöäõ ÈöÜÆóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ İóåõã ãøõÓúáöãõæäó-</div><br>  (nor can you make the deaf to hear the call, when they flee, turning their backs. Nor can you lead the blind out of their error. You can only make to hear those who believe in Our Ayat, so they submit (became Muslims).) meaning, those who have hearing and insight will respond to you, those whose hearing and sight are of benefit to their hearts and who are humble towards Allah and to the Message that comes to them through the mouths of the Messengers, may peace be upon them.  </div></body></html>
