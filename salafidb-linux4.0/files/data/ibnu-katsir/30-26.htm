In their Talbiyah (during Hajj and `Umrah they used to say, "At Your service, You have no partner except the partner that You have, You own Him and whatever he owns.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÖóÑóÈó áóßõãú ãøóËóáÇğ ãøöäú ÃóäİõÓößõãú</div><br>  (He sets forth for you a parable from yourselves) `something which you yourselves can see witness, and understand.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú áøóßõãú ãøöä ãøóÇ ãóáóßóÊú ÃóíúãóÜäõßõãú ãøöä ÔõÑóßóÂÁó İöì ãóÇ ÑóÒóŞúäóÜßõãú İóÃóäÊõãú İöíåö ÓóæóÂÁñ</div><br>  (Do you have partners among those whom your right hands possess to share as equals in the wealth We have bestowed on you...) `None of you would like to have his servant as a partner in his wealth, each of them having an equal share.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÎóÇİõæäóåõãú ßóÎöíİóÊößõãú ÃóäİõÓóßõãú</div><br>  (whom you fear as you fear each other.) `You fear that they will have a share in your wealth with you.' Abu Mijlaz said, "You do not fear that your servant will have a share in your wealth, because he has no such right; similarly, Allah has no partner.'' The point is, that since any one of you would abhor such a thing, how can you attribute rivals to Allah from among His creation At-Tabarani recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "The people of Shirk used to say in their Talbiyah, `At Your service, You have no partner except the partner that You have, You own Him and whatever he owns.' Then Allah revealed the words:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú áøóßõãú ãøöä ãøóÇ ãóáóßóÊú ÃóíúãóÜäõßõãú ãøöä ÔõÑóßóÂÁó İöì ãóÇ ÑóÒóŞúäóÜßõãú İóÃóäÊõãú İöíåö ÓóæóÂÁñ ÊóÎóÇİõæäóåõãú ßóÎöíİóÊößõãú ÃóäİõÓóßõãú</div><br>  (Do you have partners among those whom your right hands possess to share as equals in the wealth We have bestowed on you, whom you fear as you fear each other)'' If humans have this characteristic, this parable shows that it is even less befitting for Allah to have a partner.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó äõİóÕøöáõ ÇáÇøñíóÜÊö áöŞóæúãò íóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (Thus do We explain the signs in detail to a people who have sense.) Then Allah points out that when the idolators worship others instead of Him, doing so out of their own folly and ignorance:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáö ÇÊøóÈóÚó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú</div><br>  (Nay, but those who do wrong follow...), meaning, the idolators,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóåúæóÇÁóåõãú</div><br>  (...their own lusts) means, in their worship of false gods without knowledge.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä íóåúÏöì ãóäú ÃóÖóáøó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (Then who will guide him whom Allah has sent astray) means, no one can guide them if Allah has decreed that they will be misguided.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ áóåõã ãøöä äøóÜÕöÑöíäó</div><br>  (And for such there will be no helpers.) means, there is no one who can save them from the power of Allah or grant them a way out, for what He wills, happens and what He does not will, does not happen.  </div></body></html>
