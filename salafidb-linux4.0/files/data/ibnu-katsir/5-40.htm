During the time of Jahiliyyah, this was also the punishment for the thief, and Islam upheld this punishment. In Islam, there are several conditions that must be met before this punishment is carried out, as we will come to know, Allah willing. There are other rulings that Islam upheld after modifying these rulings, such as that of blood money for example. When Does Cutting the Hand of the Thief Become Necessary In is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, n   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÚóäó Çááåõ ÇáÓøóÇÑöŞó íóÓúÑöŞõ ÇáúÈóíúÖóÉó İóÊõŞúØóÚõ íóÏõåõ¡ æóíóÓúÑöŞõ ÇáúÍóÈúáó İóÊõŞúØóÚõ íóÏõå»</div><br>  (May Allah curse the thief who steals an egg and as a result his hand is cut off, and who steals rope and as a result his hand is cut off.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊõŞúØóÚõ íóÏõ ÇáÓøóÇÑöŞö İöí ÑõÈúÚö ÏöíäóÇÑò İóÕóÇÚöÏğÇ»</div><br>  (The hand of the thief shall be cut off if he steals a quarter of a Dinar or more.) Muslim recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊõŞúØóÚõ íóÏõ ÇáÓøóÇÑŞö ÅöáøóÇ İöí ÑõÈúÚö ÏöíäÇÑò İóÕóÇÚöÏğÇ»</div><br>  (The hand of the thief shall only be cut off if he steals a quarter of a Dinar or more.) This Hadith is the basis of the matter since it specifies (that the least amount of theft that deserves cutting the hand) is a quarter of a Dinar.  So this Hadith fixes the value. And saying that it is three Dirhams is not a contradiction. This is because the Dinar in question was equal to twelve Dirhams, so three Dirhams equalled a fourth of a Dinar. So in this way it is possible to harmonize these two views. This opinion was reported from `Umar bin Al-Khattab, `Uthman bin `Affan, <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>When Does Cutting the Hand of the Thief Become Necessary</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  In is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, n   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÚóäó Çááåõ ÇáÓøóÇÑöŞó íóÓúÑöŞõ ÇáúÈóíúÖóÉó İóÊõŞúØóÚõ íóÏõåõ¡ æóíóÓúÑöŞõ ÇáúÍóÈúáó İóÊõŞúØóÚõ íóÏõå»</div><br>  (May Allah curse the thief who steals an egg and as a result his hand is cut off, and who steals rope and as a result his hand is cut off.)

So in this way it is possible to harmonize these two views. This opinion was reported from `Umar bin Al-Khattab, `Uthman bin `Affan, `Ali bin Abi Talib - may Allah be pleased with them - and it is the view of `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, Al-Layth bin Sa`d, Al-Awza`i, and Ash-Shafi`i and his companions. This is also the view of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal and Ishaq bin Rahwayh in one of the narrations from him, as well as Abu Thawr, and Dawud bin `Ali Az-Zahari, may Allah have mercy upon them. As for Imam Abu Hanifah and his students Abu Yusuf, Muhammad and Zufar, along with Sufyan Ath-Thawri, they said that the least amount of theft that deserves cutting off the hand is ten Dirhams, whereas a Dinar was twelve Dirhams at that time. The first ruling is the correct one, that the least amount of theft is one forth of a Dinar or more. This meager amount was set as the limit for cutting the hand, so that the people would refrain from theft, and this is a wise decision to those who have sound comprehension. Hence Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌóÒóÂÁğ ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈóÇ äóßóÜáÇğ ãøöäó Çááøóåö æóÇááøóåõ ÚóÒöíÒñ Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (as a recompense for that which both committed, a punishment by way of example from Allah. And Allah is All-Powerful, All-Wise.) This is the prescribed punishment for the evil action they committed, by stealing the property of other people with their hands. Therefore, it is fitting that the tool they used to steal the people's wealth be cut off as punishment from Allah for their error.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÚóÒöíÒñ</div><br>  (And Allah is All-Powerful, ) in His torment,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (All-Wise.) in His commands, what he forbids, what He legislates and what He decrees. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Repentance of the Thief is Acceptable</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä ÊóÇÈó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö Ùõáúãöåö æóÃóÕúáóÍó İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó íóÊõæÈõ Úóáóíúåö Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (But whosoever repents after his crime and does righteous good deeds, then verily, Allah will pardon him. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)  Therefore, whoever repents and goes back to Allah after he commits theft, then Allah will forgive him. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that a woman committed theft during the time of the Messenger of Allah and those from whom she stole brought her and said, "O Allah's Messenger! This woman stole from us.'' Her people said, "We ransom her.'' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇŞúØóÚõæÇ íóÏóåóÇ»</div><br>  (Cut off her hand.) They said, "We ransom her with five hundred Dinars.'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇŞúØóÚõæÇ íóÏóåóÇ»</div><br>  (Cut off her hand.) Her right hand was cut off and the woman asked, "O Messenger of Allah! Is there a chance for me to repent'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú ÃóäúÊö Çáúíóæúãó ãöäú ÎóØöíÆóÊößö ßóíóæúãó æóáóÏóÊúßö Ãõãøõß»</div><br>  (Yes. This day, you are free from your sin just as the day your mother gave birth to you.) Allah sent down the verse in Surat Al-Ma'idah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä ÊóÇÈó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö Ùõáúãöåö æóÃóÕúáóÍó İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó íóÊõæÈõ Úóáóíúåö Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (But whosoever repents after his crime and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah), then verily, Allah will pardon him. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This woman was from the tribe of Makhzum. Her story was narrated in the Two Sahihs from Az-Zuhri from `Urwah from `A'ishah, The incident caused concern for the Quraysh after she committed the theft during the time of the battle of the Conquest of Makkah. They said, "Who can talk to Allah's Messenger about her matter'' They then said, "Who dares speak to him about such matters other than Usamah bin Zayd, his loved one.'' When the woman was brought to the Messenger of Allah , Usamah bin Zayd talked to him about her and the face of the Messenger changed color (because of anger) and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊóÔúİóÚõ İöí ÍóÏó ãöäú ÍõÏõæÏö Çááåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó¿»</div><br>  (Do you intercede in a punishment prescribed by Allah) Usamah said to him, "Ask Allah to forgive me, O Allah's Messenger!'' During that night, the Messenger of Allah stood up and gave a speech and praised Allah as He deserves to be praised. He then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãøóÇ ÈóÚúÏõ İóÅöäøóãóÇ Ãóåúáóßó ÇáøóĞöíäó ãöäú ŞóÈúáößõãú Ãóäøóåõãú ßóÇäõæÇ ÅöĞóÇ ÓóÑóŞó İöíåöãõ ÇáÔøóÑöíİõ ÊóÑóßõæåõ¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÓóÑóŞó İöíåöãõ ÇáÖøóÚöíİõ ÃóŞóÇãõæÇ Úóáóíúåö ÇáúÍóÏøó¡ æóÅöäøöí æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö áóæú Ãóäøó İóÇØöãóÉó ÈöäúÊó ãõÍóãøóÏò ÓóÑóŞóÊú áóŞóØóÚúÊõ íóÏóåóÇ»</div><br>  (Those who were before you were destroyed because when an honorable person among them would steal, they would leave him. But, when a weak man among them stole, they implemented the prescribed punishment against him. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! If Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad stole, I will have her hand cut off.) The Prophet commanded that the hand of the woman who stole be cut off, and it was cut off. `A'ishah said, `Her repentance was sincere afterwards, and she got married and she used to come to me so that I convey her needs to the Messenger of Allah.'' This is the wording that Muslim collected, and in another narration by Muslim, `A'ishah said, "She was a woman from Makhzum who used to borrow things and deny that she took them. So the Prophet ordered that her hand be cut off.'' Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÚúáóãú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó áóåõ ãõáúßõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÃóÑúÖö</div><br>  (Know you not that to Allah (Alone) belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth!)
