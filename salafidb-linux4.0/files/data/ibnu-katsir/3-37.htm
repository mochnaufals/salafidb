So her Lord (Allah) accepted her with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner and put her under the care of Zakariyya.

Allah made Zakariyya Maryam's guardian for her benefit, so that she would learn from his tremendous knowledge and righteous conduct. He was the husband of her maternal aunt, as Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Jarir stated, or her brother-in-law, as mentioned in the Sahih,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöĞóÇ ÈöíóÍúíóì æóÚöíÓì¡ æóåõãóÇ ÇÈúäóÇ ÇáúÎóÇáóÉ»</div><br>  (I saw John and `Isa, who are maternal cousins.)  We should state that in general terms, what Ibn Ishaq said is plausible, and in this case, Maryam was under the care of her maternal aunt. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah decided that `Amarah, the daughter of Hamzah, be raised by her maternal aunt, the wife of Ja`far bin Abi Talib, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÎóÇáóÉõ ÈöãóäúÒöáóÉö ÇáúÃõã»</div><br>  (The maternal aunt is just like the mother.)

Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Ash-Sha`tha, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi and As-Suddi said, "He would find with her the fruits of the summer during winter, and the fruits of the winter during summer.''
