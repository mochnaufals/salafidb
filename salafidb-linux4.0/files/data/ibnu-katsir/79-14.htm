"These are the angels who remove the souls from the Children of Adam.'' Among them are those whose souls are removed by the angels with difficulty, as if he is being drowned during its removal. There are those people whose souls the angels remove with ease, as if they were unraveling him (i.e., his soul from him) due to their briskness. This is the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáäøóÜÔöØóÜÊö äóÔúØÇğ </div><br>  (By those who free briskly.) This has been mentioned by Ibn `Abbas. In reference to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóÜÈöÍóÜÊö ÓóÈúÍÇğ </div><br>  (And by the swimmers, swimming.) Ibn Mas`ud said, "They are the angels.'' Similar statements have been reported from `Ali, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, and Abu Salih. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇáÓøóÜÈöŞóÜÊö ÓóÈúŞÇğ </div><br>  (And by the racers, racing.) It has been narrated from `Ali, Masruq, Mujahid, Abu Salih, and Al-Hasan Al-Basri that this means the angels. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇáúãõÏóÈøöÑóÊö ÃóãúÑÇğ </div><br>  (And by those who arrange affairs.) `Ali, Mujahid, `Ata', Abu Salih, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, and As-Suddi all said, "They are the angels.'' Al-Hasan added, "They control the affairs from the heaven to the earth, meaning by the command of their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Description of the Day of Judgement, the People, and what They will say</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊóÑúÌõİõ ÇáÑøóÇÌöİóÉõ - ÊóÊúÈóÚõåóÇ ÇáÑøóÇÏöİóÉõ </div><br>  (On the Day the Rajifah shakes, followed by the Radifah.) Ibn `Abbas said, "These are the two blasts (of the Trumpet) -- the first and the second.'' Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others have made similar statements. It has been reported from Mujahid that he said, "In reference to the first, it is the statement of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊóÑúÌõİõ ÇáÑøóÇÌöİóÉõ </div><br>  (On the Day the Rajifah shakes,) This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊóÑúÌõİõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ æóÇáúÌöÈóÇáõ</div><br>  (On the Day the earth and the mountains shake.) (73:14) The second is Ar-Radifah, and it is like the Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍõãöáóÊö ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ æóÇáúÌöÈóÇáõ İóÏõßøóÊóÇ ÏóßøóÉğ æóÍöÏóÉğ </div><br>  (And the earth and mountains shall be removed from their places, and crushed with a single crushing.) (69:14)'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞõáõæÈñ íóæúãóÆöĞò æóÇÌöİóÉñ </div><br>  (Hearts that Day will tremble.) Ibn `Abbas said, "This means afraid.'' Mujahid and Qatadah also said this.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÈúÕóÜÑõåóÇ ÎóÜÔöÚóÉñ </div><br>  (Their vision humiliated.) meaning, the eyes of the people. It means that the eyes will be lowly and disgraced from what they will witness of terrors. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõæäó ÃóÁöäøóÇ áóãóÑúÏõæÏõæäó İöì ÇáúÍóÜİöÑóÉö </div><br>  (They say: "Shall we indeed be brought back from Al-Hafirah'') meaning, the idolators of the Quraysh and whoever rejects the Hereafter as they did. They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁöĞóÇ ßõäøóÇ ÚöÙóÜãÇğ äøóÎöÑóÉğ </div><br>  (Even after we are bones Nakhirah) It has also been recited: (äóÇÎöÑóÉğ) (Nakhirah) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, "This means decayed.'' Ibn `Abbas said, "It is the bone when it has decayed and air enters into it.'' Concerning their saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÅöĞÇğ ßóÑøóÉñ ÎóÜÓöÑóÉñ</div><br>  (It would in that case be a return with loss.) (79:12) Muhammad bin Ka`b said that the Quraysh said, "If Allah brings us back to life after we die, then surely we will be losers.'' Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóãóÇ åöìó ÒóÌúÑóÉñ æóÍöÏóÉñ - İóÅöĞóÇ åõã ÈöÇáÓøóÇåöÑóÉö </div><br>  (But it will be only a single Zajrah. When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) meaning, this is a matter that is from Allah that will not occur twice, nor will there be any opportunity to affirm it or verify it. The people will be standing and looking. This will be when Allah commands the angel Israfil to blow into the Sur, which will be the blowing of the resurrection. At that time the first people and the last people will all be standing before their Lord looking. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÏúÚõæßõãú İóÊóÓúÊóÌöíÈõæäó ÈöÍóãúÏöåö æóÊóÙõäøõæäó Åöä áøóÈöËúÊõãú ÅöáÇøó ŞóáöíáÇğ </div><br>  (On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed but a little while!) (17:52) Allah has also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóãúÑõäóÂ ÅöáÇøó æóÍöÏóÉñ ßóáóãúÍò ÈöÇáúÈóÕóÑö </div><br>  (And our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) (54:50) Allah also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóãúÑõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÅöáÇøó ßóáóãúÍö ÇáúÈóÕóÑö Ãóæú åõæó ÃóŞúÑóÈõ</div><br>  (And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer.) (16:77) Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ åõã ÈöÇáÓøóÇåöÑóÉö </div><br>  (When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) Ibn `Abbas said, "As-Sahirah means the entire earth.'' Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Abu Salih have all said this as well. `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd have all said, "As-Sahirah means the face of the earth.'' Mujahid said, "They will be at its (the earth's) lowest part, and they will be brought out to highest part.'' Then he said, "As-Sahirah is a level place.'' Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ åõã ÈöÇáÓøóÇåöÑóÉö </div><br>  (When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) "Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊõÈóÏøóáõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ÛóíúÑó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊõ æóÈóÑóÒõæÇú ááøóåö ÇáúæóÇÍöÏö ÇáúŞóåøóÇÑö </div><br>  (On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:48) and He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÜóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáúÌöÈóÇáö İóŞõáú íóäÓöİõåóÇ ÑóÈøöì äóÓúİÇğ - İóíóĞóÑõåóÇ ŞóÇÚÇğ ÕóİúÕóİÇğ - áÇøó ÊóÑóì İöíåóÇ ÚöæóÌÇğ æóáÇ ÃóãúÊÇğ </div><br>  (And they ask you concerning the mountains: say, "My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust. Then He shall leave them as a level smooth plain.You will see therein nothing crooked or curved.) (20:105-107) and Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>" æóíóæúãó äõÓóíøöÑõ ÇáúÌöÈóÇáó æóÊóÑóì ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ÈóÇÑöÒóÉğ</div><br>  (And the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away, and you will see the earth as a leveled plain.) (18:47) and the earth will be brought forth which will have mountains upon it, and it will not be considered from this earth (of this life). It will be an earth that no sin will be performed on it, nor will any blood be shed upon it.''  </div></body></html>
