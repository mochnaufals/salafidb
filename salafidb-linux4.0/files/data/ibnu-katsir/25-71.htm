He said, "Then what'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóäú ÊõÒóÇäöí ÍóáöíáóÉó ÌóÇÑöß»</div><br>  (That you commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.) `Abdullah said, "Then Allah revealed, confirming that:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÏúÚõæäó ãóÚó Çááøóåö ÅöáóÜåóÇ ÁóÇÎóÑó</div><br>  (And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah....)'' This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i, and by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.  It was narrated that Sa`id bin Jubayr heard Ibn `Abbas saying that some of the people of Shirk killed a great deal and committed Zina a great deal, then they came to Muhammad and said: "What you are saying and calling people to is good, if only you would tell us that there is a way to expiate for what we have done.'' Then the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÏúÚõæäó ãóÚó Çááøóåö ÅöáóÜåóÇ ÁóÇÎóÑó</div><br>  (And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah...) was revealed, as was the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íÚöÈóÇÏöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÓúÑóİõæÇú Úóáóì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú</div><br>  (Say: "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves!'') (39:53).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóİúÚóáú Ğáößó íóáúŞó ÃóËóÇãÇğ</div><br>  (and whoever does this shall receive Athama.) It was recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said: "Athama is a valley in Hell.'' `Ikrimah also said that Athama refers to valleys in Hell in which those who commit unlawful sexual acts will be punished. This was also narrated from Sa`id bin Jubayr and Mujahid. As-Suddi said that Athama referred to punishment, which is closer to the apparent meaning of the Ayah. This interpretation makes it interchangeable with what comes next, the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÖóÜÚóİú áóåõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíÜãóÉö</div><br>  (The torment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection,) i.e., repetitive and intensified.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÎúáõÏú İöíåö ãõåóÇäÇğ</div><br>  (and he will abide therein in disgrace;) scorned and humiliated.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóä ÊóÇÈó æóÁóÇãóäó æóÚóãöáó ÚóãóáÇğ ÕóÜáöÍÇğ</div><br>  (Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds;) means, those who do these evil deeds will be punished in the manner described,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóä ÊóÇÈó</div><br>  (Except those who repent), that is; those who repent in this world to Allah from all of those deeds, for then Allah will accept their repentance. This is evidence that the repentance of the murderer is acceptable, and there is no contradiction between this and the Ayah in Surat An-Nisa':   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóŞúÊõáú ãõÄúãöäÇğ ãøõÊóÚóãøöÏÇğ</div><br>  (And whoever kills a believer intentionally) (4:93), because even though this was revealed in Al-Madinah, the meaning is general, and it could be interpreted to refer to one who does not repent, because this Ayah states that forgiveness is only for those who repent. Moreover Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íóÛúİöÑõ Ãóä íõÔúÑóßó Èöåö æóíóÛúİöÑõ ãóÇ Ïõæäó Ğóáößó áöãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him, but He forgives except that to whom He wills) (4:48). And in the authentic Sunnah, it is reported from the Messenger of Allah that the repentance of a murderer is acceptable, as was stated in the story of the person who killed one hundred men and then repented, and Allah accepted his repentance, and other Hadiths.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó íõÈóÏøöáõ Çááøóåõ ÓóíøöÆóÇÊöåöãú ÍóÓóäóÜÊò æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑÇğ ÑøóÍöíãÇğ</div><br>  (for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)

A man will be brought and it will be said, "Take away his major sins and ask him about his minor sins.'' So it will be said to him: "On such and such a day, you did such and such, and on such and such a day, you did such and such.'' He will say, "Yes, and he will not be able to deny anything.'' Then it will be said to him: "For every evil deed you now have one good merit.'' He will say: "O Lord, I did things that I do not see here.'') He (Abu Dharr) said: "And the Messenger of Allah smiled so broadly that his molars could be seen.'' Muslim recorded it. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Jabir heard Makhul say, "A very old man with sunken eyes came and said, `O Messenger of Allah, a man betrayed others and did immoral deeds, and there was no evil deed which he did not do. If (his sins) were to be distributed among the whole of mankind, they would all be doomed. Is there any repentance for him'' The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÃóÓúáóãúÊó¿»</div><br>  (Have you become Muslim) He said, "As for me, I bear witness that there is no God but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.'' The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöäøó Çááåó ÛóÇİöÑñ áóßó ãóÇ ßõäúÊó ßóĞóáößó¡ æóãõÈóÏøöáõ ÓóíøöÆóÇÊößó ÍóÓóäóÇÊ»</div><br>  (Allah will forgive you for whatever you have done like that, and will replace your evil deeds with good merits.) The man said: "O Messenger of Allah, even my betrayals and immoral actions'' The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÛóÏóÑóÇÊõßó æóİóÌóÑóÇÊõß»</div><br>  (Even your betrayals and immoral actions.) "The man went away saying `La ilaha illallah' and `Allahu Akbar.''' Allah tells us how His mercy extends to all His creatrues, and that whoever among them repents to Him, He will accept his repentance for any sin, great or small.
