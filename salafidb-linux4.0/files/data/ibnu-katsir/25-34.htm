They said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæúáÇó äõÒøöáó Úóáóíúåö ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäõ ÌõãúáóÉğ æóÍöÏóÉğ</div><br>  ("Why is not the Qur'an revealed to him all at once'') meaning, why was this Qur'an, which was revealed to him, not sent down all at one time, as the previous Books, the Tawrah, Injil, Zabur and other Divine Books Allah answered them, telling them that it was revealed in stages over twenty-three years, according to events and circumstances, and whatever rulings were needed, in order to strengthen the hearts of the believers, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõÑúÁÇäğÇ İóÑóŞúäóÇåõ</div><br>  (And (it is) a Qur'an which We have divided (into parts)...) (17:106). Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöäõËóÈøöÊó Èöåö İõÄóÇÏóßó æóÑóÊøóáúäóÇåõ ÊóÑúÊöíáÇğ</div><br>  (that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.) Qatadah said it means: "We have explained it.'' `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said it means: "We have given its interpretation.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÃúÊõæäóßó ÈöãóËóáò</div><br>  (And no example or similitude do they bring,) This means no arguments or doubts,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÌöÆúäóÜßó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö æóÃóÍúÓóäó ÊóİúÓöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (but We reveal to you the truth, and the better explanation thereof.) They do not say anything in an attempt to oppose the truth, but We respond to them with the truth of that same matter, more clearly and more eloquently than anything they say. Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "The Qur'an was sent down all at once to the first heaven on Laylatul-Qadr (the Night of Power), then it was revealed over twenty years.'' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÃúÊõæäóßó ÈöãóËóáò ÅöáÇøó ÌöÆúäóÜßó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö æóÃóÍúÓóäó ÊóİúÓöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (And no example or similitude do they bring, but We reveal to you the truth, and the better explanation thereof.) and:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõÑúÁÇäğÇ İóÑóŞúäóÇåõ áöÊóŞúÑóÃóåõ Úóáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö Úóáóì ãõßúËò æóäóÒøóáúäóÜåõ ÊóäúÒöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And (it is) a Qur'an which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages) (17:106). Then Allah tells us about the terrible state of the disbelievers when they are raised on the Day of Resurrection and gathered into Hell:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÍúÔóÑõæäó Úóáóì æõÌõæåöåöãú Åöáóì Ìóåóäøóãó ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÔóÑøñ ãøóßóÇäÇğ æóÃóÖóáøõ ÓóÈöíáÇğ </div><br>  (Those who will be gathered to Hell on their faces, such will be in an evil state, and most astray from the path. ) In the Sahih, it is reported from Anas that a man said, "O Messenger of Allah, how will the disbeliever be gathered on his face on the Day of Resurrection'' The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöí ÃóãúÔóÇåõ Úóáóì ÑöÌúáóíúåö ŞóÇÏöÑñ Ãóäú íõãúÔöíóåõ Úóáóì æóÌúåöåö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (The One Who caused him to walk on his two feet is able to make him walk on his face on the Day of Resurrection.)  </div></body></html>
