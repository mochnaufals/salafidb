Then Allah commands His Messenger to warn his tribe of near kindred, i.e., those who were most closely related to him, and to tell them that nothing could save any of them except for faith in Allah. Allah also commanded him to be kind and gentle with the believing servants of Allah who followed him, and to disown those who disobeyed him, no matter who they were. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäú ÚóÕóæúßó İóŞõáú Åöäøöì ÈóÑöìÁñ ãøöãøóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (Then if they disobey you, say: "I am innocent of what you do.'') This specific warning does not contradict the general warning; indeed it is a part of it, as Allah says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöÊõäĞöÑó ŞóæúãÇğ ãøóÂ ÃõäĞöÑó ÁóÇÈóÂÄõåõãú İóåõãú ÛóÜİöáõæäó </div><br>  (In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.) (36:6),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöÊõäĞöÑó Ãõãøó ÇáúŞõÑóì æóãóäú ÍóæúáóåóÇ</div><br>  (that you may warn the Mother of the Towns and all around it) (42:7),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäĞöÑú Èöåö ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÎóÇİõæäó Ãóä íõÍúÔóÑõæÇú Åöáóì ÑóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  (And warn therewith those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord) (6:51),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöÊõÈóÔøöÑó Èöåö ÇáúãõÊøóŞöíäó æóÊõäúĞöÑó Èöåö ŞóæúãÇğ áøõÏøÇğ</div><br>  (that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa, and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.) (19:97),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøñäĞöÑóßõãú Èöåö æóãóä ÈóáóÛó</div><br>  (that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach) (6:19), and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóßúİõÑú Èöåö ãöäó ÇáÇøñÍúÒóÇÈö İóÇáäøóÇÑõ ãóæúÚöÏõåõ</div><br>  (but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) (11:17). According to Sahih Muslim, the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö¡ áóÇ íóÓúãóÚõ Èöí ÃóÍóÏñ ãöäú åóĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉö íóåõæÏöíøñ æóáóÇ äóÕúÑóÇäöíøñ¡ Ëõãøó áóÇ íõÄúãöäõ Èöí ÅöáøóÇ ÏóÎóáó ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, no one from these nations -- Jewish or Christian -- hears of me then does not believe in me, but he will enter Hell.) Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the revelation of this Ayah, some of which we will quote below: Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "When Allah revealed the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäĞöÑú ÚóÔöíÑóÊóßó ÇáÇøñŞúÑóÈöíäó </div><br>  (And warn your tribe of near kindred.), the Prophet went to As-Safa', climbed up and called out,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÕóÈóÇÍóÇå»</div><br>  (O people!) The people gathered around him, some coming of their own accord and others sending people on their behalf to find out what was happening. The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ Èóäöí ÚóÈúÏöÇáúãõØøóáöÈö¡ íóÇ Èóäöí İöåúÑò¡ íóÇÇóÈäöí áõÄóíó¡ ÃóÑóÃóíúÊõãú áóæú ÃóÎúÈóÑúÊõßõãú Ãóäøó ÎóíúáğÇ ÈöÓóİúÍö åóĞóÇ ÇáúÌóÈóáö ÊõÑíÏõ Ãóäú ÊõÛöíÑó Úóáóíúßõãú ÕóÏøóŞúÊõãõæäöí¿»</div><br>  (O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani Fihr, O Bani Lu'ayy! What do you think, if I told you that there was a cavalry at the foot of this mountain coming to attack you -- would you believe me) They said, "Yes.'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöäøöí äóĞöíÑñ áóßõãú Èóíúäó íóÏóí ÚóĞóÇÈò ÔóÏöíÏ»</div><br>  (Then I warn you of a great punishment that is close at hand.) Abu Lahab said, "May you perish for the rest of the day! You only called us to tell us this'' Then Allah revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÈøóÊú íóÏóÂ ÃóÈöì áóåóÈò æóÊóÈøó </div><br>  (Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) 111:1 This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her said: "When the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäĞöÑú ÚóÔöíÑóÊóßó ÇáÇøñŞúÑóÈöíäó </div><br>  (And warn your tribe of near kindred) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah stood up and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ İóÇØöãóÉõ ÇÈúäóÉõ ãõÍóãøóÏò¡ íóÇ ÕóİöíøóÉõ ÇÈúäóÉõ ÚóÈúÏöÇáúãõØøóáöÈö¡ íóÇ Èóäöí ÚóÈúÏöÇáúãõØøóáöÈö¡ áóÇ Ãóãúáößõ áóßõãú ãöäó Çááåö ÔóíúÆğÇ Óóáõæäöí ãöäú ãóÇáöí ãóÇ ÔöÆúÊõã»</div><br>  (O Fatimah daughter of Muhammad, O Safiyyah daughter of `Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani `Abd Al-Muttalib, I cannot help you before Allah. Ask me for whatever you want of my wealth.) This was recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Qabisah bin Mukhariq and Zuhayr bin `Amr said: "When the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäĞöÑú ÚóÔöíÑóÊóßó ÇáÇøñŞúÑóÈöíäó </div><br>  (And warn your tribe of near kindred.) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah climbed on top of a rock on the side of a mountain and started to call out:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ Èóäöí ÚóÈúÏö ãóäóÇİò¡ ÅöäøóãóÇ ÃóäóÇ äóĞöíÑñ¡ æóÅöäøóãóÇ ãóËóáöí æóãóËóáõßõãú ßóÑóÌõáò ÑóÃóì ÇáúÚóÏõæøó İóĞóåóÈó íóÑúÈóÃõ Ãóåúáóåõ íóÎúÔóì Ãóäú íóÓúÈöŞõæåõ¡ İóÌóÚóáó íõäóÇÏöí æóíóåúÊöİõ: íóÇ ÕóÈóÇÍóÇå»</div><br>  (O Bani `Abd Manaf, I am indeed a warner, and the parable of me and you is that of a man who sees the enemy so he goes to save his family, fearing that the enemy may reach them before he does.) And he started to call out, (O people!) It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóæßøóáú Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÒöíÒö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö </div><br>  (And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,) means, `in all your affairs, for He is your Helper, Protector and Supporter, and He is the One Who will cause you to prevail and will make your word supreme.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì íóÑóÇßó Íöíäó ÊóŞõæãõ </div><br>  (Who sees you when you stand up. ) means, He is taking care of you. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÕúÈöÑú áöÍõßúãö ÑóÈøößó İóÅöäøóßó ÈöÃóÚúíõäöäóÇ</div><br>  (So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes) (52:48) Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì íóÑóÇßó Íöíäó ÊóŞõæãõ </div><br>  (Who sees you when you stand up.) means, "To pray.'' `Ikrimah said: "He sees him when he stands and bows and prostrates.'' Al-Hasan said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì íóÑóÇßó Íöíäó ÊóŞõæãõ </div><br>  (Who sees you when you stand up.) "When you pray alone.'' Ad-Dahhak said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì íóÑóÇßó Íöíäó ÊóŞõæãõ </div><br>  (Who sees you when you stand up.) "When you are lying in bed and when you are sitting.'' Qatadah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì íóÑóÇßó</div><br>  (Who sees you) "When you are standing, when you are sitting, and in all other situations.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóŞóáøõÈóßó İöì ÇáÓøóÜÌöÏöíäó </div><br>  (And your movements among those who fall prostrate.)

And your movements among those who fall prostrate.) "When you pray, He sees you when you pray alone and when you pray in congregation.'' This was also the view of `Ikrimah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Al-Hasan Al-Basri.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ åõæó ÇáÓøóãöíÚõ ÇáúÚóáöíãõ </div><br>  (Verily, He, only He, is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.)
