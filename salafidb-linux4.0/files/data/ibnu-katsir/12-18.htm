They went back to their father, during the darkness of the night, crying and showing sorrow and grief for losing Yusuf. They started giving excuses to their father for what happened to Yusuf, falsely claiming that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ĞóåóÈúäóÇ äóÓúÊóÈöŞõ</div><br>  (We went racing with one another), or had a shooting competition,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóßúäóÇ íõæÓõİó ÚöäÏó ãóÊóÜÚöäóÇ</div><br>  (and left Yusuf by our belongings), guarding our clothes and luggage,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóßóáóåõ ÇáĞøöÆúÈõ</div><br>  (and a wolf devoured him), which is exactly what their father told them he feared for Yusuf and warned against.

They tried to lessen the impact of the grave news they were delivering. They said, `We know that you will not believe this news, even if you consider us truthful. So what about when you suspect that we are not truthful, especially since you feared that the wolf might devour Yusuf and that is what happened' Therefore, they said, `You have reason not to believe us because of the strange coincidence and the amazing occurrence that happened to us.

They slaughtered a sheep, according to Mujahid, As-Suddi and several other scholars, and stained Yusuf's shirt with its blood. They claimed that this was the shirt Yusuf was wearing when the wolf devoured him, being stained with his blood. But, they forgot to tear the shirt, and this is why Allah's Prophet Ya`qub did not believe them. Rather, he told them what he felt about what they said to him, thus refusing their false claim,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ÓóæøóáóÊú áóßõãú ÃóäİõÓõßõãú ÃóãúÑğÇ İóÕóÈúÑñ Ìóãöíáñ</div><br>  (Nay, but your ownselves have made up a tale.
