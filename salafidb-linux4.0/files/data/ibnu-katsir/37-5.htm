This was also the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Masruq, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, As-Suddi, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Qatadah said, "The angels form ranks in the heavens.'' Muslim recorded that Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İõÖøöáúäóÇ Úóáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö ÈöËóáóÇËò: ÌõÚöáóÊú ÕõİõæİõäóÇ ßóÕõİõæİö ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉö¡ æóÌõÚöáóÊú áóäóÇ ÇáúÃóÑúÖõ ßõáøõåóÇ ãóÓúÌöÏğÇ¡ æóÌõÚöáó áóäóÇ ÊõÑóÇÈõåóÇ ØóåõæÑğÇ¡ ÅöĞóÇ áóãú äóÌöÏö ÇáúãóÇÁ»</div><br>  (We have been favored over the rest of mankind in three ways: our ranks have been made like the ranks of the angels; the entire earth has been made a Masjid for us; and its soil has been made a means of purification for us if we cannot find water.)'' Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Jabir bin Samurah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ÊóÕõİøõæäó ßóãóÇ ÊóÕõİøõ ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉõ ÚöäúÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú¿»</div><br>  (Will you not form ranks as the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord) We said, `How do the angels form ranks in the presence of their Lord' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÊöãøõæäó ÇáÕøõİõæİó ÇáúãõÊóŞóÏøöãóÉó¡ æóíóÊóÑóÇÕøõæäó İöí ÇáÕøóİ»</div><br>  (They complete the rows nearer the front and they consolidate the rows. )'' As-Suddi and others said that the Ayah   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇáÒóÌöÑóÊö ÒóÌúÑÇğ </div><br>  (By those who drive the clouds in a good way. ) means that they drive the clouds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇáÊøóÜáöíóÜÊö ĞößúÑÇğ </div><br>  (By those who bring the Dhikr.) As-Suddi said, "The angels bring the Scriptures and the Qur'an from Allah to mankind.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The One True God is Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÅöáóÜåóßõãú áóæóÇÍöÏñ ÑóÈøõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Verily, your God is indeed One, Lord of the heavens and the earth,) This is the One by Whom the oath is sworn, stating that there is no God worthy of worship but He, Lord of the heavens and the earth,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÈóíúäóåõãóÂ</div><br>  (and all that is between them,) means, of created beings.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÈøõ ÇáúãóÔóÜÑöŞö</div><br>  (and Lord of every point of the sun's risings.) means, He is the Sovereign Who is controlling His creation by subjugating it and all that is in it of stars, planets and heavenly bodies which appear from the east and set in the west. Mentioning the east is sufficient and there is no need for the west to be mentioned too, because it is implied in what is said. This has also been stated clearly elsewhere, in the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÃõŞúÓöãõ ÈöÑóÈøö ÇáúãóÔóÜÑöŞö æóÇáúãóÛóÜÑöÈö ÅöäøóÇ áóŞóÜÏöÑõæäó </div><br>  (So I swear by the Lord of all the points of sunrise and sunset in the east and the west that surely We are able.)
