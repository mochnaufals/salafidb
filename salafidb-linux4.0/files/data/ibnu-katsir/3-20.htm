Allah states that there is no religion accepted with Him from any person, except Islam. Islam includes obeying all of the Messengers until Muhammad who finalized their commission, thus closing all paths to Allah except through Muhammad . Therefore, after Allah sent Muhammad , whoever meets Allah following a path other than Muhammad's, it will not be accepted of him. In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÈúÊóÛö ÛóíúÑó ÇáÅöÓúáóÜãö ÏöíäğÇ İóáóä íõŞúÈóáó ãöäúåõ</div><br>  (And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him) 3:85.  In this Ayah 3:19, Allah said, asserting that the only religion accepted with Him is Islam,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáÏøöíäó ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö ÇáÅöÓúáóÜãõ</div><br>  (Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.)  Allah then states that those who were given the Scripture beforehand divided in the religion after Allah sent the Messengers and revealed the Books to them providing them the necessary proofs to not do so. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÇÎúÊóáóİó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ÅöáÇøó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõãõ ÇáúÚöáúãõ ÈóÛúíğÇ Èóíúäóåõãú</div><br>  (Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except out of rivalry, after knowledge had come to them.) meaning, some of them wronged others. Therefore, they differed over the truth, out of envy, hatred and enmity for each other. This hatred made some of them defy those whom they hated even if they were correct. Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóßúİõÑú ÈöÂíóÜÊö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And whoever disbelieves in the Ayat of Allah) meaning, whoever rejects what Allah sent down in His Book,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøó Çááøóåö ÓóÑöíÚõ ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈö</div><br>  (then surely, Allah is Swift in reckoning.) Allah will punish him for his rejection, reckon him for his denial, and torment him for defying His Book. Thereafter, Allah said.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅäú ÍóÂÌøõæßó</div><br>  (So if they dispute with you (Muhammad )) so if they argue with you about Tawhid,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞõáú ÃóÓúáóãúÊõ æóÌúåöìó ááøóåö æóãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚóäö</div><br>  (Say: "I have submitted myself to Allah (in Islam), and (so have) those who follow me'') meaning, Say, `I have made my worship sincere for Allah Alone without partners, rivals, offspring or companion,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚóäö</div><br>  (and those who follow me) who followed my religion and embraced my creed.'

It is He Who guides whom He wills and allows whom He wills to stray, and He has the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proof for all of this. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÈóÕöíÑñ ÈöÇáúÚöÈóÇÏö</div><br>  (And Allah sees the servants.) for He has perfect knowledge of who deserves to be guided and who does not deserve to be guided.

This and similar Ayat are clear proofs that the Message of Muhammad is universal to all creation, as it is well established in the religion, according to the various texts of the Book and Sunnah. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íóÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ Åöäøöì ÑóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö Åöáóíúßõãú ÌóãöíÚğÇ</div><br>  (Say (O Muhammad ): "O mankind!

The Two Sahihs and other collections of Hadith recorded that the Prophet sent letters to the kings of the earth during his time and to different peoples, Arabs and non-Arabs, People of the Book and the unlettered, just as Allah had commanded him. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar said, that Hammam said that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö¡ áóÇ íóÓúãóÚõ Èöí ÃóÍóÏñ ãöäú åóĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉö: íóåõæÏöíøñ æóáóÇ äóÕúÑóÇäöíøñ¡ æóãóÇÊó æóáóãú íõÄúãöäú ÈöÇáøóĞöí ÃõÑúÓöáúÊõ Èöåö¡ ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇäó ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! No member of this Ummah, no Jew or Christian, hears of me but dies without believing in what I was sent with, but will be among the people of the Fire.) Muslim recorded this Hadith.  The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈõÚöËúÊõ Åöáóì ÇáúÃóÍúãóÑö æóÇáúÃóÓúæóÏ»</div><br>  (I was sent to the red and black. ) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóÇäó ÇáäøóÈöíøõ íõÈúÚóËõ Åöáì Şóæúãöåö ÎóÇÕøóÉğ¡ æóÈõÚöËúÊõ Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö ÚóÇãøóÉ»</div><br>  (A Prophet used to be sent to his people, but I was sent to all mankind.)  </div></body></html>
