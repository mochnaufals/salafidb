Then He explains it further, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌóäøóÜÊö ÚóÏúäò</div><br>  (`Adn Gardens) meaning, eternal gardens (of Paradise),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõİóÊøóÍóÉğ áøóåõãõ ÇáÇøñÈúæóÇÈõ</div><br>  (whose doors will be opened for them.) means, when they come to them (these gardens), their gates will open for them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõÊøóßöÆöíäó İöíåóÇ</div><br>  (Therein they will recline;) It was said that this means that they will sit cross-legged on chairs beneath canopies.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÏúÚõæäó İöíåóÇ ÈöİóÜßöåóÉò ßóËöíÑóÉò</div><br>  (therein they will call for fruits in abundance) means, whatever they ask for, they will find it, and it will be prepared just as they wanted it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÔóÑóÇÈñ</div><br>  (and drinks;) means, whatever kind of drink they want, the servants will bring it to them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÃóßúæóÇÈò æóÃóÈóÇÑöíŞó æóßóÃúÓò ãøöä ãøóÚöíäò </div><br>  (With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine.) (56: 18).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚöäÏóåõãú ŞóÜÕöÑóÊõ ÇáØøóÑúİö</div><br>  (And beside them will be Qasirat-at-Tarf (chaste females)) means, they restrain their glances from anyone except their husbands, and do not turn to anyone else.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊúÑóÇÈñ</div><br>  ((and) of equal ages.) means, they will all be of the same age. This is the understanding of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b and As-Suddi.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ ãóÇ ÊõæÚóÏõæäó áöíóæúãö ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈö </div><br>  (This it is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning!) means, `this that We have mentioned of the features of Paradise is what He has prepared for His pious servants who will reach it after they have been resurrected from their graves and been saved from the Fire.' Then Allah tells us that Paradise will never come to an end or disappear or cease to be. He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóÜĞóÇ áóÑöÒúŞõäóÇ ãóÇ áóåõ ãöä äøóİóÇÏò </div><br>  (Verily, this is Our provision which will never finish.) This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ÚöäÏóßõãú íóäİóÏõ æóãóÇ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö ÈóÇŞò</div><br>  (Whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever is with Allah will remain) (16:96).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóØóÂÁğ ÛóíúÑó ãóÌúĞõæĞò</div><br>  (a gift without an end.) (11:108)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõãú ÃóÌúÑñ ÛóíúÑõ ãóãúäõæäò</div><br>  (for them is a reward that will never come to an end.) (84:25).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõßõáõåóÇ ÏóÂÆöãñ æöÙöáøõåóÇ Êöáúßó ÚõŞúÈóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÊøóŞóæÇú æøóÚõŞúÈóì ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÇáäøóÇÑõ</div><br>  (its provision is eternal and so is its shade; this is the end of those who have Taqwa, and the end (final destination) of the disbelievers is Fire.)(13:35). And there are many similar Ayat.  </div></body></html>
