And unto those who are Jews, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their backs or their Hawaya, or is mixed up with a bone.

Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáúÈóŞóÑö æóÇáúÛóäóãö ÍóÑøóãúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ÔõÍõæãóåõãóÂ</div><br>  (and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep...) The Jews used to forbid these types of foods saying that Isra'il, or Ya`qub, used to forbid them for himself so they too forbid them. This was mentioned by As-Suddi. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ÍóãóáóÊú ÙõåõæÑõåõãóÂ</div><br>  (except what adheres to their backs) refers to the fat that clings to their backs. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæö ÇáúÍóæóÇíóÂ</div><br>  (or their Hawaya) that is, the entrails, according to Abu Ja`far bin Jarir. He also said, "The meaning here is, `And from ox and sheep, We forbade their fat for the Jews, except the fat on their backs and what the entrails carry.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that, Ibn `Abbas said that the, Hawaya, are the entrails. Similar was reported from Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ãóÇ ÇÎúÊóáóØó ÈöÚóÙúãò</div><br>  (....or is mixed up with a bone.) means, We allowed the Jews the fat that is mixed with bones. Ibn Jurayj commented, "The fat on the rump that is mixed with the tailbone was allowed for them, and also the fat on the legs, head, eyes and what adheres to the bones.'' As-Suddi said similarly. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÌóÒóíúäóÜåõã ÈöÈóÛúíöåöãú</div><br>  (Thus We recompensed them for their rebellion.) meaning, We imposed this restriction on them as recompense for their rebellion and defying Our commandments. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöÙõáúãò ãøöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú ÍóÑøóãúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ØóíøöÈóÜÊò ÃõÍöáøóÊú áóåõãú æóÈöÕóÏøöåöãú Úóä ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö ßóËöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful for them -- and for their hindering many from Allah's way) 4:160. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æöÅöäøóÇ áóÕóÜÏöŞõæäó</div><br>  (And verily, We are Truthful.) means, We were justified in the penalty We gave them. Ibn Jarir commented, "We are Truthful in what We informed you of, O Muhammad; Our forbidding these foods for them, not as they claimed, that Israel merely forbade these things for himself (so they imitated him, they claimed).'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Tricks of the Jews, and Allah's Curse</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  `Abdullah bin `Abbas narrated, "When `Umar bin Al-Khattab was told that Samurah sold liquor, he commented, `May Allah fight Samurah! Did he not know that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÚóäó Çááåõ ÇáúíóåõæÏó ÍõÑøöãóÊú Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáÔøõÍõæãõ İóÌóãóáõæåóÇ İóÈóÇÚõæåóÇ»</div><br>  (May Allah curse the Jews! The fats were forbidden for them, so they melted the fat and sold it.)'' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Jabir bin `Abdullah said, "In the year of the victory of Makkah, I heard Allah's Messenger saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ ÍóÑøóãó ÈóíúÚó ÇáúÎóãúÑö æóÇáúãóíúÊóÉö æóÇáúÎöäúÒöíÑö æóÇáúÃóÕúäóÇã»</div><br>  (Allah and His Messenger have forbidden selling alcoholic drinks (intoxicants), dead animals, swine and idols.) He was asked, `What about the fat of dead animals They are used to dye skins, paint ships and are used as light by the people.' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ åõæó ÍóÑóÇã»</div><br>  (No, it is still unlawful.) He then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÇÊóáó Çááåõ ÇáúíóåõæÏó Åöäøó Çááåó áóãøóÇ ÍóÑøóãó Úóáóíúåöãú ÔõÍõæãóåóÇ Ìóãóáõæåõ Ëõãøó ÈóÇÚõæåõ æóÃóßóáõæÇ Ëóãóäóå»</div><br>  (May Allah fight the Jews! When Allah forbade them the fats of animals, they melted the fat, sold it and ate its price.)'' The Group recorded this Hadith.  </div></body></html>
