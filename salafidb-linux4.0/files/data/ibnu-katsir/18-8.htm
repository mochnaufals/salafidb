Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóÚóáøóßó ÈóÜÎöÚñ äøóİúÓóßó Úóáóì ÁóÇËóÜÑöåöãú Åöä áøóãú íõÄúãöäõæÇú ÈöåóÜĞóÇ ÇáúÍóÏöíËö</div><br>  (Perhaps, you would kill yourself in grief, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration.) meaning the Qur'an.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÓóİÇğ</div><br>  (in grief) Allah is saying, `do not destroy yourself with regret.' Qatadah said: "killing yourself with anger and grief over them.'' Mujahid said: "with anxiety.'' These are synonymous, so the meaning is: `Do not feel sorry for them, just convey the Message of Allah to them. Whoever goes the right way, then he goes the right way only for the benefit of himself. And whoever goes astray, then he strays at his own loss, so do not destroy yourself in sorrow for them.' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>This World is the Place of Trial Then Allah tells us that He has made this world a temporary abode, adorned with transient beauty, and He made it a place of trial, not a place of settlement.

Abu Maslamah narrated from Abu Nadrah from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÍõáúæóÉñ ÎóÖöÑóÉñ¡ æóÅöäøó Çááåó ãõÓúÊóÎúáöİõßõãú İöíåóÇ İóäóÇÙöÑñ ãóÇĞóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó¡ İóÇÊøóŞõæÇ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ æóÇÊøóŞõæÇ ÇáäøöÓóÇÁó¡ İóÅöäøó Ãóæøóáó İöÊúäóÉö Èóäöí ÅöÓúÑóÇÆöíáó ßóÇäóÊú İöí ÇáäøöÓóÇÁ»</div><br>  (This world is sweet and green, and Allah makes you generations succeeding one another, so He is watching what you will do.

Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means everything on it would be wiped out and destroyed. Mujahid said: "a dry and barren plain.'' Qatadah said, "A plain on which there are no trees or vegetation.''  </div></body></html>
