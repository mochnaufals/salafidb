For this reason the Qur'an is called Al-Mathani (i.e., oft-repeated).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõÊøóŞöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, those who have Taqwa,) i.e., those who fear Allah and are dutiful towards Him in this world,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ãóŞóÇãò Ãóãöíäò</div><br>  (will be in place of security.) means, in the Hereafter, i.e., in Paradise, where they will be safe from death and the fear of leaving it, and from every kind of worry, grief, terror and exhaustion, and from the Shaytan and his wiles, and from all other troubles and disasters.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÌóäøóÜÊò æóÚõíõæäò </div><br>  (Among Gardens and Springs). This is in direct contrast to the state of the doomed, who will have the tree of Zaqqum and boiling water.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóáúÈóÓõæäó ãöä ÓõäÏõÓò</div><br>  (Dressed in Sundus) means, the finest of silk, such as shirts and the like.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöÓúÊóÈúÑóŞò</div><br>  (and Istabraq) means, silk which is woven with shiny threads, like a splendid garment which is worn over regular clothes.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõÊóŞóÜÈöáöíäó</div><br>  (facing each other, ) means, sitting on thrones where none of them will sit with his back to anyone else.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó æóÒóæøóÌúäóÜåõã ÈöÍõæÑò Úöíäò </div><br>  (So (it will be).

The meaning is that they will never taste death there. It was reported in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÄúÊóì ÈöÇáúãóæúÊö İöí ÕõæÑóÉö ßóÈúÔò ÃóãúáóÍó İóíõæŞóİõ Èóíúäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóÇáäøóÇÑö¡ Ëõãøó íõĞúÈóÍõ¡ Ëõãøó íõŞóÇáõ: íóÇ Ãóåúáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÎõáõæÏñ İóáóÇ ãóæúÊó¡ æóíóÇ Ãóåúáó ÇáäøóÇÑö ÎõáõæÏñ İóáóÇ ãóæúÊ»</div><br>  (Death will be brought forth in the image of a fine ram. It will be made to stand between Paradise and Hell, then it will be slaughtered. It will be said, "O people of Paradise, it is eternal, no more death; and O people of Hell, it is eternal, no more death.'') This Hadith was already quoted in our discussion of Surah Maryam. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurayrah said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõŞóÇáõ áöÃóåúáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö: Åöäøó áóßõãú Ãóäú ÊóÕöÍøõæÇ İóáóÇ ÊóÓúŞóãõæÇ ÃóÈóÏğÇ¡ æóÅöäøó áóßõãú Ãóäú ÊóÚöíÔõæÇ İóáóÇ ÊóãõæÊõæÇ ÃóÈóÏğÇ¡ æóÅöäøó áóßõãú Ãóäú ÊóäúÚóãõæÇ İóáóÇ ÊóÈúÃóÓõæÇ ÃóÈóÏğÇ¡ æóÅöäøó áóßõãú Ãóäú ÊóÔöÈøõæÇ İóáóÇ ÊóåúÑóãõæÇ ÃóÈóÏğÇ»</div><br>  (It will be said to the people of Paradise, "It is granted to you that you will be healthy and will never fall ill, you will live and never die, you will enjoy a life of luxury and will never be miserable, you will be youthful and will never grow old.'')'' This was recorded by Muslim. It was reported that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäö ÇÊøóŞóì Çááåó ÏóÎóáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó¡ íóäúÚóãõ İöíåóÇ æóáóÇ íóÈúÃóÓõ¡ æóíóÍúíóÇ İöíåóÇ İóáóÇ íóãõæÊõ¡ áóÇ ÊóÈúáóì ËöíóÇÈõåõ¡ æóáóÇ íóİúäóì ÔóÈóÇÈõå»</div><br>  (Whoever has Taqwa of Allah, he will enter Paradise and enjoy a life of luxury and he will never be miserable. He will live therein and never die, his clothes will never wear out and his youth will never fade.)''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóŞóÜåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáúÌóÍöíãö</div><br>  (and He will save them from the torment of the blazing Fire,) means, along with this great and eternal blessing, He will also have saved them from the agonizing torment in the depths of Hell, so they will have achieved their desired aim and avoided the thing they feared. Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÖúáÇğ ãøöä ÑøóÈøößó Ğóáößó åõæó ÇáúİóæúÒõ ÇáúÚóÙöíãõ </div><br>  (As a bounty from your Lord! That will be the supreme success!) meaning, that will be from His bounty and kindness towards them. It was reported in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÚúãóáõæÇ æóÓóÏøöÏõæÇ æóŞóÇÑöÈõæÇ¡ æóÇÚúáóãõæÇ Ãóäøó ÃóÍóÏğÇ áóäú íõÏúÎöáóåõ Úóãóáõåõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (Work and strive hard, and know that no one will enter Paradise by virtue of his deeds.) They said, "Not even you, O Messenger of Allah'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóáóÇ ÃóäóÇ¡ ÅöáøóÇ Ãóäú íóÊóÛóãøóÏóäöíó Çááåõ ÈöÑóÍúãóÉò ãöäúåõ æóİóÖúá»</div><br>  (Not even me, unless Allah showers me with His mercy and grace.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóãóÇ íóÓøóÑúäóÜåõ ÈöáöÓóÜäößó áóÚóáøóåõãú íóÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó </div><br>  (Certainly, We have made this easy in your tongue, in order that they may remember. ) means, `We have made this Qur'an, which We have sent down, easy, plain and clear, in your language which is the most eloquent, clear and beautiful of all languages.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóåõãú íóÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (in order that they may remember.) means, in order that they may understand and know. Despite the fact that it is so plain and clear, there are still people who disbelieve, who stubbornly go against it. Allah says to His Messenger , consoling him and promising him victory, and warning those who reject him that they will be destroyed.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÑúÊóŞöÈú Åöäøóåõãú ãøõÑúÊóŞöÈõæäó </div><br>  (Wait then; verily, they (too) are waiting.) meaning, `they will come to know who will be victorious and whose word will prevail in this world and in the Hereafter. For victory will be for you, O Muhammad, and for your brothers among the Prophets and Messengers, and for the believers who followed you,' as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÊóÈó Çááøóåõ áÇøÛúáöÈóäøó ÃóäóÇú æóÑõÓõáöì</div><br>  (Allah has decreed: "Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious.'')

Theirs will be the curse, and theirs will be the evil abode.) (40:51-52) This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ad-Dukhan. All praise and thanks are due to Allah and in Him is all strength and protection.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
