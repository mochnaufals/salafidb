Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÚúãóáú ÓõæÁÇğ Ãóæú íóÙúáöãú äóİúÓóåõ Ëõãøó íóÓúÊóÛúİöÑö Çááøóåó íóÌöÏö Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑÇğ ÑøóÍöíãÇğ </div><br>  (And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas commented about this Ayah, "Allah informs His servants of His forgiveness, forbearing generosity and expansive mercy. So whoever commits a sin, whether minor or major,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó íóÓúÊóÛúİöÑö Çááøóåó íóÌöÏö Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑÇğ ÑøóÍöíãÇğ</div><br>  (but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) even if his sins were greater than the heavens, the earth and the mountains.'' Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali said, "Whenever I hear anything from the Messenger of Allah, Allah benefits me with whatever He wills of that. Abu Bakr told me, and Abu Bakr has said the truth, that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú ãõÓúáöãò íõĞúäöÈõ ĞóäúÈğÇ¡ Ëõãøó íóÊóæóÖøóÃõ İóíõÕóáøöí ÑóßúÚóÊóíúäö¡ Ëõãøó íóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõ Çááåó áöĞáößó ÇáĞøóäúÈö¡ ÅöáøóÇ ÛóİóÑó áóå»</div><br>  (No Muslim commits a sin and then performs ablution, prays two Rak`ahs and begs Allah for forgiveness for that sin, but He forgives him.) He then recited these two Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÚúãóáú ÓõæÁÇğ Ãóæú íóÙúáöãú äóİúÓóåõ</div><br>  (And whoever does evil or wrongs himself), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÇ İóÚóáõæÇú İóÜÍöÔóÉğ Ãóæú ÙóáóãõæÇú ÃóäúİõÓóåõãú</div><br>  (And those who, when they have committed Fahishah or wronged themselves with evil).'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóßúÓöÈú ÅöËúãÇğ İóÅöäøóãóÇ íóßúÓöÈõåõ Úóáóì äóİúÓöåö</div><br>  (And whoever earns sin, he earns it only against himself.) is similar to His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÒöÑõ æóÇÒöÑóÉñ æöÒúÑó ÃõÎúÑóì</div><br>  (And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another). So no one will avail anyone else. Rather, every soul, and none else, shall carry its own burden. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÚóáöíãÇğ ÍóßöíãÇğ</div><br>  (And Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.) meaning, this occurs due to His knowledge, wisdom, fairness and mercy.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóáøóãóßó ãóÇ áóãú Êóßõäú ÊóÚúáóãõ</div><br>  (and taught you that which you knew not.), before this revelation was sent down to you.

Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßõäÊó ÊóÑúÌõæ Ãóä íõáúŞóì Åöáóíúßó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈõ ÅöáÇøó ÑóÍúãóÉğ ãøöä ÑøóÈøößó</div><br>  (And you were not expecting that the Book (this Qur'an) would be sent down to you, but it is a mercy from your Lord). So Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó İóÖúáõ Çááøóåö Úóáóíúßó ÚóÙöíãÇğ</div><br>  (And ever great is the grace of Allah unto you (O Muhammad )).  </div></body></html>
