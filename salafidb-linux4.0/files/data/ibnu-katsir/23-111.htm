He will say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÎúÓóÆõæÇú İöíåóÇ</div><br>  (Remain you in it with ignominy!) meaning, abide therein, humiliated, despised and scorned.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó Êõßóáøöãõæäö</div><br>  (And speak you not to Me!) means, `do not ask for this again, for I will not respond to you. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÎúÓóÆõæÇú İöíåóÇ æóáÇó Êõßóáøöãõæäö</div><br>  (Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!) "These are the words of Ar-Rahman when silencing them.'' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, "The people of Hell will call on Malik for forty years, and he will not answer them. Then he will respond and tell them that they are to abide therein. By Allah, their cries will mean nothing to Malik or to the Lord of Malik. Then they will call on their Lord and will say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú ÑóÈøóäóÇ ÛóáóÈóÊú ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÔöŞúæóÊõäóÇ æóßõäøóÇ ŞóæúãÇğ ÖóÂáøöíäó - ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÎúÑöÌúäóÇ ãöäúåóÇ İóÅöäú ÚõÏúäóÇ İóÅöäøóÇ ÙóÜáöãõæäó </div><br>  (Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us, and we were (an) erring people. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If ever we return (to evil), then indeed we shall be wrongdoers.) 23:106-107 Allah will not answer them for a time span equivalent to twice the duration of this world. Then He will reply:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÎúÓóÆõæÇú İöíåóÇ æóáÇó Êõßóáøöãõæäö</div><br>  (Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!) By Allah, the people will not utter a single word after that, and they will merely be in the Fire of Hell, sighing in a high and low tone. Their voices are likened to those of donkeys, which start in a high tone and end in a low tone.'' Then Allah will remind them of their sins in this world and how they used to make fun of His believing servants and close friends:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó İóÑöíŞñ ãøöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöì íóŞõæáõæäó ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÁóÇãóäøóÇ İóÇÛúİöÑú áóäóÇ æóÇÑúÍóãúäóÇ æóÃóäÊó ÎóíúÑõ ÇáÑóÍöãöíäó İóÇÊøóÎóĞúÊõãõæåõãú ÓöÎúÑöíøÇğ</div><br>  (Verily, there was a party of My servants who used to say: "Our Lord!

But you took them for a laughing stock,) meaning, `you made fun of them for calling on Me and praying to Me,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÃóäÓóæúßõãú ĞößúÑöì</div><br>  (so much so that they made you forget My remembrance) means, your hatred for them made you forget what I would do to you.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõäúÊõãú ãøöäúåõãú ÊóÖúÍóßõæäó</div><br>  (while you used to laugh at them!) means, at their deeds and worship. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÌúÑóãõæÇú ßóÇäõæÇú ãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú íóÖúÍóßõæäó - æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÑøõæÇú Èöåöãú íóÊóÛóÇãóÒõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed. And, whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to another.) 83:29-30 meaning, they used to slander them in mockery. Then Allah tells us how He will reward His friends and righteous servants, and says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì ÌóÒóíúÊõåõãõ Çáúíóæúãó ÈöãóÇ ÕóÈóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (Verily, I have rewarded them this Day for their patience;) meaning, `for the harm and mockery that you inflicted on them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøóåõãú åõãõ ÇáúİóÂÆöÒõæäó</div><br>  (they are indeed the ones that are successful.) I have caused them to attain the victory of joy, safety, Paradise and salvation from the Fire.'  </div></body></html>
