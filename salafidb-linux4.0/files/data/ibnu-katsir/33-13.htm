They were tried and tested, and were shaken with a mighty shaking. At this time hypocrisy emerged, and those in whose hearts was a disease spoke about what they really felt.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú íóŞõæáõ ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞõæäó æóÇáøóĞöíäó İöì ŞõáõæÈöåöã ãøóÑóÖñ ãøóÇ æóÚóÏóäóÇ Çááøóåõ æóÑóÓõæáõåõ ÅöáÇøó ÛõÑõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease said: "Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion!'') Their hypocrisy became apparent, while the one in whose heart was doubt became weak, and he expressed the ideas that were in his heart because of the weakness of his faith and the difficulty of the situation.

According to another narration:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúãóÏöíäóÉ»</div><br>  (Al-Madinah. ) It was said that the origin of its name Yathrib was that a man settled there from (the people of) Al-`Amaliq whose name was Yathrib bin `Ubayd bin Mahlayil bin `Aws bin `Amlaq bin Lawudh bin Iram bin Sam bin Nuh. This was the view of As-Suhayli. He said: "And it was narrated from some of them that he said, `It is given eleven names in the Tawrah: Al-Madinah, Tabah, Tayyibah, Al-Miskinah, Al-Jabirah, Al-Muhibbah, Al-Mahbubah, Al-Qasimah, Al-Majburah, Al-`Adhra' and Al-Marhumah.''' r   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ãõŞóÇãó áóßõãú</div><br>  (There is no position for you.) means, `here, with the Prophet , you cannot stand guard,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÑúÌöÚõæÇú</div><br>  (Therefore go back) means, `to your houses and dwellings'.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÊóÃúĞöäõ İóÑöíŞñ ãøöäúåõãõ ÇáäøóÈöìøó</div><br>  (And a band of them ask for permission of the Prophet) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him said, "These were Banu Harithah, who said, `We fear for our homes, that they may be robbed.''' This was also stated by others. Ibn Ishaq mentioned that the one who said this was `Aws bin Qayzi. They were using as an excuse to go back to their houses the claim that they were lying open and had nothing to protect them from the enemy, so they were afraid for their homes. But Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ åöìó ÈöÚóæúÑóÉò</div><br>  (And they lay not open.) meaning, it is not as they claim.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä íõÑöíÏõæäó ÅöáÇøó İöÑóÇÑÇğ</div><br>  (They but wished to flee.) means, they wanted to run away from the battlefield.  </div></body></html>
