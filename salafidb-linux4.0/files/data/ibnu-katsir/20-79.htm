He was to take them away from Fir`awn's captivity. Allah expounds upon this in Surahs other than this noble Surah. Musa left with the Children of Israel, and when the people of Egypt awoke in the morning they found that not a single one of them remained in Egypt. Fir`awn became extremely furious. He sent callers into all of the cities to gather together his army from all of his lands and provinces. He said to them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó åóÜÄõáÇÁö áóÔöÑúĞöãóÉñ Şóáöíáõæäó - æóÅöäøóåõãú áóäóÇ áóÛóÂÆöÙõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, these indeed are but a small band. And verily, they have done what has enraged us.) 26:54-55 Then when he gathered his army and organized his troops, he set out after them and they followed them at dawn when the sun began to rise.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÊóÑóÂÁóÇ ÇáúÌóãúÚóÇäö</div><br>  (And when the two hosts saw each other) 26:61 This means that each person of the two parties was looking at the other party.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÊóÑóÂÁóÇ ÇáúÌóãúÚóÇäö ŞóÇáó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ãõæÓóì ÅöäøóÇ áóãõÏúÑóßõæäó - ŞóÇáó ßóáÇøó Åöäøó ãóÚöìó ÑóÈøöì ÓóíóåúÏöíäö </div><br>  (The companions of Musa said: "We are sure to be overtaken.'' (Musa) said: "Nay, verily, with me is my Lord. He will guide me.'') 26:61-62 Musa stopped with the Children of Israel and the sea was in front of them and Fir`awn was behind them. Then, at that moment, Allah revealed to Musa,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÖúÑöÈú áóåõãú ØóÑöíŞÇğ İöì ÇáúÈóÍúÑö íóÈóÓÇğ</div><br>  (And strike a dry path for them in the sea.) So Musa struck the sea with his stick and he said, "Split for me, by the leave of Allah.'' Thus, it split, and each separate part of the water became like a huge mountain. Then, Allah sent a wind to the land of the sea and it burned the soil until it became dry like the ground that is on land. For this reason Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÖúÑöÈú áóåõãú ØóÑöíŞÇğ İöì ÇáúÈóÍúÑö íóÈóÓÇğ áÇøó ÊóÎóÇİõ ÏóÑóßÇğ</div><br>  (and strike a dry path for them in the sea, fearing neither to be overtaken...) This means being caught by Fir`awn.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÎúÔóì</div><br>  (nor being afraid.) meaning, "Do not be afraid of the sea drowning your people.'' Then, Allah, the Exalted, said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÊúÈóÚóåõãú İöÑúÚóæúäõ ÈöÌõäõæÏöåö İóÛóÔöíóåõãú ãøöäó Çáúíóãøö</div><br>  (Then Fir`awn pursued them with his hosts, but the sea Al-Yamm completely overwhelmed them) Al-Yamm means the sea.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ÛóÔöíóåõãú</div><br>  (and covered them up. ) meaning, covered them up with a thing that was well-familiar to them in such a situa- tion, as Allah states;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãõÄúÊóİößóÉó Ãóåúæóì - İóÛóÔøóÜåóÇ ãóÇ ÛóÔøóì </div><br>  (And He destroyed the overthrown cities. So there covered them that which did cover.) 53:53-54 As Fir`awn pursued them into the sea, misled his people and did not lead them to the path of correct guidance, likewise, he will go ahead of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and will lead them in to the Hellfire. And evil indeed is the place to which they are led.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÈóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó ŞóÏú ÃóäÌóíúäóÜßõãú ãøöäú ÚóÏõæøößõãú æóæóÇÚóÏúäóÜßõãú ÌóÇäöÈó ÇáØøõæÑö ÇáÇøñíúãóäó æóäóÒøóáúäóÇ Úóáóíúßõãõ Çáúãóäøó æóÇáÓøóáúæóì </div><br>  </div></body></html>
