Whenever we climbed a high place, went up a hill or went down a valley, we used to say, `Allah is the Most Great,' raising our voices. The Prophet came by us and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ¡ ÇÑúÈóÚõæÇ Úóáì ÃóäúİõÓößõãú¡ İóÅöäøóßõãú áóÇ ÊóÏúÚõæäó ÃóÕóãøó æáóÇ ÛóÇÆöÈğÇ¡ ÅäøóãóÇ ÊóÏúÚõæäó ÓóãöíÚğÇ ÈóÕöíÑğÇ¡ Åäøó ÇáøóĞí ÊóÏúÚõæäó ÃóŞúÑÈõ Åöáóì ÃóÍóÏößõãú ãöäú ÚõäõŞö ÑóÇÍöáóÊöåö¡ íÇ ÚóÈúÏóÇááåö Èúäó ŞóíúÓò¡ ÃóáóÇ ÃõÚóáøöãõßó ßóáöãóÉğ ãöäú ßõäõæÒö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¿ áóÇ Íóæúáó æóáóÇ ŞõæøóÉó ÅöáøóÇ ÈöÇááå»</div><br>  (O people! Be merciful to yourselves (i.e., don't raise your voices), for you are not calling a deaf or an absent one, but One Who is All-Hearer, All-Seer.

O `Abdullah bin Qais (Abu Musa's name) should I teach you a statement that is a treasure of Paradise: `La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (there is no power or strength except from Allah).')  This Hadith was also recorded in the Two Sahihs, and Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah recorded similar wordings.
