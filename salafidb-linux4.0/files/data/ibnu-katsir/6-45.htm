He is the One Who has no partners, Who accepts the supplication from whomever He wills. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóÑóÃóíúÊõßõã Åöäú ÃóÊóÜßõãú ÚóĞóÇÈõ Çááøóåö Ãóæú ÃóÊóÊúßõãú ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ÃóÛóíúÑó Çááøóåö ÊóÏúÚõæäó Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó </div><br>  (Say: "Tell me if Allah's torment comes upon you, or the Hour comes upon you, would you then call upon any one other than Allah (Reply) if you are truthful!'') This means, you -- disbelievers -- will not call other than Allah in this case, because you know that none except He is able to remove the affliction. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó</div><br>  (if you are truthful) by taking gods besides Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ÅöíøóÜåõ ÊóÏúÚõæäó İóíóßúÔöİõ ãóÇ ÊóÏúÚõæäó Åöáóíúåö Åöäú ÔóÂÁó æóÊóäÓóæúäó ãóÇ ÊõÔúÑößõæäó </div><br>  (Nay! To Him alone you call, and, if He willed, He would remove that (distress) for which you call upon Him, and you forget at that time whatever partners you joined with Him (in worship)!) for in times of necessity, you only call on Allah and forget your idols and false deities. In another Ayah, Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÓøóßõãõ ÇáúÖøõÑøõ İöì ÇáúÈóÍúÑö Öóáøó ãóä ÊóÏúÚõæäó ÅöáÇó ÅöíøóÇåõ</div><br>  (And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him (Allah)) 17:67. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÃóÑúÓóáäóÂ Åöáóì Ãõãóãò ãøöä ŞóÈúáößó İóÃóÎóĞúäóÜåõãú ÈöÇáúÈóÃúÓóÂÁö</div><br>  (Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you.

Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóæúáÇ ÅöĞú ÌóÂÁóåõãú ÈóÃúÓõäóÇ ÊóÖóÑøóÚõæÇú</div><br>  (When Our torment reached them, why then did they not believe with humility) Meaning: Why do they not believe and humble themselves before Us when We test them with disaster'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöä ŞóÓóÊú ŞõáõæÈõåõãú</div><br>  (But their hearts became hardened,) for their hearts are not soft or humble,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÒóíøóäó áóåõãõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇø íóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (and Shaytan made fair-seeming to them that which they used to do. ) That is, Shirk, defiance and rebellion.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ äóÓõæÇú ãóÇ ĞõßøöÑõæÇú Èöåö</div><br>  (So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded,) by ignoring and turning away from it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóÍúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ÃóÈúæóÇÈó ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (We opened to them the gates of everything,) Meaning: `We opened the gates of provisions for them from wherever they wished, so that We deceive them.' We seek refuge with Allah from such an end. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ İóÑöÍõæÇú ÈöãóÂ ÃõæÊõæÇú</div><br>  f(until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given,) such as wealth, children and provisions,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÎóĞúäóÜåõãú ÈóÛúÊóÉğ İóÅöĞóÇ åõãú ãøõÈúáöÓõæäó</div><br>  (all of a sudden, We took them to punishment and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) They have no hope for any type of good thing. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "Whomever Allah gives provision and he thinks that Allah is not testing him, has no wisdom. Whomever has little provision and thinks that Allah will not look at (provide for) him, has no wisdom.'' He then recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ äóÓõæÇú ãóÇ ĞõßøöÑõæÇú Èöåö İóÊóÍúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ÃóÈúæóÇÈó ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ İóÑöÍõæÇú ÈöãóÂ ÃõæÊõæÇú ÃóÎóĞúäóÜåõãú ÈóÛúÊóÉğ İóÅöĞóÇ åõãú ãøõÈúáöÓõæäó </div><br>  (So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) He added, "By the Lord of the Ka`bah! Allah deceived these people, when He gave them what they wished, and then they were punished.'' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement.  </div></body></html>
