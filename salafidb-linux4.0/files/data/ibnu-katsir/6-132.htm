Therefore, We did not punish any of the nations, except after sending Messengers to them, so that they have no excuse.' Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ãøöäú ÃõãøóÉò ÅöáÇøó ÎóáÇó İöíåóÇ äóĞöíÑñ</div><br>  (And there never was a nation but a warner had passed among them.) 35:24, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÈóÚóËúäóÇ İöì ßõáøö ÃõãøóÉò ÑøóÓõæáÇğ Ãóäö ÇÚúÈõÏõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ÇáúØøóÜÛõæÊó</div><br>  (And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): "Worship Allah, and stay away from At-Taghut (all false deities).") 16:36, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßõäøóÇ ãõÚóĞøöÈöíäó ÍóÊøóì äóÈúÚóËó ÑóÓõæáÇğ</div><br>  (And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger.) 17:15, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøóãóÇ ÃõáúŞöìó İöíåóÇ İóæúÌñ ÓóÃóáóåõãú ÎóÒóäóÊõåóÂ Ãóáóãú íóÃúÊößõãú äóĞöíÑñŞóÇáõæÇú Èóáóì ŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóäóÇ äóĞöíÑñ İóßóĞøóÈúäóÇ</div><br>  (Every time a group is cast therein, its keeper will ask: "Did no warner come to you" They will say: "Yes, indeed a warner did come to us, but we belied him.'') 67:8-9 There are many other Ayat on this subject. At-Tabari said, "Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáößõáøò ÏóÑóÌóÜÊñ ãøöãøóÇ ÚóãöáõæÇú</div><br>  (For all there will be degrees according to what they did.) means, every person who obeys Allah or behaves disobediently, has grades and ranks according to their works, which Allah gives them as recompense, good for good and evil for evil.'' I say, it is possible that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáößõáøò ÏóÑóÌóÜÊñ ãøöãøóÇ ÚóãöáõæÇú</div><br>  (For all there will be degrees according to what they did.) refers to the disbelievers of the Jinns and mankind who will earn a place in the Fire according to their evil deeds. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó áößõáøò ÖöÚúİñ</div><br>  (He will say: "For each one there is double (torment).'')7:38, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóÕóÏøõæÇú Úóä ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö ÒöÏúäóÜåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈğÇ İóæúŞó ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íõİúÓöÏõæäó </div><br>  (Those who disbelieved and hinder (others) from the path of Allah, for them We will add torment to the torment because they used to spread corruption.) 16:88 Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÑóÈøõßó ÈöÛóÜİöáò ÚóãøóÇ íóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (And your Lord is not unaware of what they do.) Ibn Jarir commented, "All these deeds that they did, O Muhammad, they did while your Lord is aware of them, and He collects and records these deeds with Him, so that He recompenses them when they meet Him and return to Him.  </div></body></html>
