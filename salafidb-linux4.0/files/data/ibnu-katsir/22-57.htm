This was the view of Ibn Jurayj and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÊóÃúÊöíóåõãõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ÈóÛúÊóÉğ</div><br>  (until the Hour comes suddenly upon them,) Mujahid said: "By surprise.'' Qatadah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóÛúÊóÉğ</div><br>  (suddenly) means, the command of Allah will catch the people unaware. Allah never seizes a people except when they are intoxicated with pride, enjoying a life of luxury, and they think that the punishment will never come upon them, but Allah does not punish anyone except the evildoers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú íóÃúÊöíóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈõ íóæúãò ÚóŞöíãò</div><br>  (or there comes to them the torment of Yawm `Aqim.) Mujahid said, "Ubay bin Ka`b said: `Yawm `Aqim means the day of Badr.''' `Ikrimah and Mujahid said: "Yawm `Aqim means the Day of Resurrection, following which there will be no night.'' This was also the view of Ad-Dahhak and Al-Hasan Al-Basri.
