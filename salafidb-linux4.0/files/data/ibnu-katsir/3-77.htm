There are several Hadiths on the subject of this Ayah, some of which follow. The First Hadith  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said, "The Messenger of Allah said, c   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ËóáóÇËóÉñ áóÇ íõßóáøöãõåõãõ Çááåõ¡ æóáóÇ íóäúÙõÑõ Åöáóíúåöãú íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ æóáóÇ íõÒóßøöíåöãú¡ æóáóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíã»</div><br>  ŞáÊ: íÇ ÑÓæá Çááå¡ ãä åã¿ ÎÇÈæÇ æÎÓÑæÇ ŞÇá: æÃÚÇÏå ÑÓæá ÇááåÕáì Çááå Úáíå æÓáøã ËáÇË ãÑÇÊ¡ ŞÇá:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúãõÓúÈöáõ¡ æóÇáúãõäóİøöŞõ ÓöáúÚóÊóåõ ÈöÇáúÍóáöİö ÇáúßóÇĞöÈö¡ æóÇáúãóäøóÇä»</div><br>  (There are three persons whom Allah will not speak to, look at on the Day of Resurrection or purify, and they shall taste a painful torment. I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Who are they, may they gain failure and loss' He said, repeating this statement thrice, `The Musbil (man whose clothes reach below the ankles), he who swears while lying so as to sell his merchandize and the one who gives charity and reminds people of it).')'' This was also recorded by Muslim, and the collectors of the Sunan. Another Hadith  Imam Ahmad recorded that `Adi bin `Amirah Al-Kindi said, "Imru' Al-Qays bin `Abis, a man from Kindah, disputed with a man from Hadramut in front of the Messenger of Allah concerning a piece of land. The Prophet required the man from Hadramut to present his evidence, but he did not have any. The Prophet required Imru' Al-Qays to swear to his truthfulness, but the man from Hadramut said, `O Messenger of Allah! If you only require him to swear, then by the Lord of the Ka`bah (Allah), my land is lost.' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Íóáóİó Úóáì íóãöíäò ßóÇĞöÈóÉò áöíóŞúÊóØöÚó ÈöåóÇ ãóÇáó ÃóÍóÏò¡ áóŞöíó Çááåó ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó æóåõæó Úóáóíúåö ÛóÖúÈóÇä»</div><br>  (Whoever swears while lying to acquire the property of others, will meet Allah while He is angry with him.)'' Raja' one of the narrators of the Hadith, said that the Messenger of Allah then recited,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÔúÊóÑõæäó ÈöÚóåúÏö Çááøóåö æóÃóíúãóÜäöåöãú ËóãóäğÇ ŞóáöíğáÇ</div><br>  (Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths...)  Imru' Al-Qays said, `What if one forfeits this dispute, what will he gain, O Messenger of Allah' The Prophet answered, `Paradise.' Imru' Al-Qays said, `Bear witness that I forfeit all the land for him.''' An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. Another Hadith  Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Íóáóİó Úóáì íóãöíäò åõæó İöíåóÇ İóÇÌöÑñ¡ áöíóŞúÊóØöÚó ÈöåóÇ ãóÇáó ÇãúÑöì ãõÓúáöãò¡ áóŞöíó Çááåó ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó æóåõæó Úóáóíúåö ÛóÖúÈóÇä»</div><br>  (Whoever takes a false oath to deprive a Muslim of his property will meet Allah while He is angry with him.)  Al-Ash`ath said, "By Allah! This verse was revealed concerning me. I owned some land with a Jewish man who denied my right, and I complained against him to the Messenger of Allah. The Prophet asked me, `Do you have evidence' I said, `I don't have evidence.' He said to the Jew, `Take an oath then.' I said, `O Allah's Messenger! He will take a (false) oath immediately, and I will lose my property.' Allah revealed the verse,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÔúÊóÑõæäó ÈöÚóåúÏö Çááøóåö æóÃóíúãóÜäöåöãú ËóãóäğÇ ŞóáöíğáÇ</div><br>  (Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths...)''  The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith. Another Hadith  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ËóáóÇËóÉñ áóÇ íõßóáøöãõåõãõ Çááåõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ æóáóÇ íóäúÙõÑõ Åöáóíúåöãú¡ æóáóÇ íõÒóßøöíåöãú¡ æóáóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ: ÑóÌõáñ ãóäóÚó ÇÈúäó ÇáÓøóÈöíáö İóÖúáó ãóÇÁò ÚöäúÏóåõ¡ æóÑóÌõáñ Íóáóİó Úóáì ÓöáúÚóÉò ÈóÚúÏó ÇáúÚóÕúÑö íóÚúäöí ßóÇĞöÈğÇ æóÑóÌõáñ ÈóÇíóÚó ÅöãóÇãğÇ¡ İóÅöäú ÃóÚúØóÇåõ æóİóì áóåõ¡ æóÅöäú áóãú íõÚúØöåö áóãú íóİö áóå»</div><br>  (Three persons whom Allah shall not speak to on the Day of Resurrection, or look at, or purify them, and they shall taste a painful torment. (They are) a man who does not give the wayfarer some of the water that he has; a man who swears, while lying, in order to complete a sales transaction after the `Asr prayer; and a man who gives his pledge of allegiance to an Imam (Muslim Ruler), and if the Imam gives him (something), he fulfills the pledge, but if the Imam does not give him, he does not fulfill the pledge).  Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Hasan Sahih.  </div></body></html>
