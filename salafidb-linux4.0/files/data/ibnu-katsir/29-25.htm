After Ibrahim addressed them with his words of clear guidance,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Ãóä ŞóÇáõæÇú ÇŞúÊõáõæåõ Ãóæú ÍóÑøöŞõæåõ</div><br>  (except that they said: "Kill him or burn him.'') This was because proof had clearly been established against them, so they resorted to using their power and strength.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú ÇÈúäõæÇú áóåõ ÈõäúíóÜäÇğ İóÃóáúŞõæåõ İöì ÇáúÌóÍöíãö - İóÃóÑóÇÏõæÇú Èöåö ßóíúÏÇğ İóÌóÚóáúäóÜåõãõ ÇáÇøñÓúİóáöíäó </div><br>  (They said: "Build for him a building and throw him into the blazing fire!'' So they plotted a plot against him, but We made them the lowest.) (37:97-98). They spent a long time gathering a huge amount of firewood, they built a fence around it, then they set it ablaze until its flames reached up to the sky. No greater fire had ever been lit. Then they went to Ibrahim, seized him and put him into a catapult, then they threw him into the fire. But Allah made it cool and safe for him, and after spending several days in it, he emerged unscathed. For this reason and others, Allah made him an Imam for mankind, for he offered himself to the Most Merciful, he offered his body to the flames, he offered his son as a sacrifice, and he gave his wealth to care for his guests. For all of these reasons he is beloved by the followers of all religions.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóäúÌóÇåõ Çááøóåõ ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö</div><br>  (Then Allah saved him from the fire. ) means, He rescued him from it by making it cool and safe for him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğáößó áÂíóÜÊò áøöŞóæúãò íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, in this are indeed signs for a people who believe.)

This will be the state of the disbelievers. As for the believers, it will be an entirely different matter.  </div></body></html>
