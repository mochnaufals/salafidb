It has been called this because it will overwhelm the people and overcome them. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æõÌõæåñ íóæúãóÆöĞò ÎóÜÔöÚóÉñ </div><br>  (Some faces that Day will be Khashi`ah.) meaning, humiliated. This was said by Qatadah. Ibn `Abbas said, "They will be humble but this action will be of no benefit to them.'' Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÇãöáóÉñ äøóÇÕöÈóÉñ </div><br>  (Laboring, weary.) meaning, they did many deeds and became weary in their performance, yet they will be cast into a blazing Fire on the Day of Judgement. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Burqani narrated from Abu `Imran Al-Jawni that he said, " `Umar bin Al-Khattab passed by the monastery of a monk and he said: `O monk!' Then the monk came out, and `Umar looked at him and began to weep. Then it was said to him: `O Commander of the faithful! Why are you weeping' He replied: `I remembered the statement of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, in His Book,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÇãöáóÉñ äøóÇÕöÈóÉñ - ÊóÕúáóì äóÇÑÇğ ÍóÇãöíóÉğ </div><br>  (Laboring, weary. They will enter into Fire, Hamiyah.) So that is what has made me cry. ''' Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÇãöáóÉñ äøóÇÕöÈóÉñ </div><br>  (Laboring, weary.) "The Christians.'' It is narrated that `Ikrimah and As-Suddi both said, "Laboring in the worldly life with disobedience, and weariness in the Fire from torment and perdition.'' Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah all said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÕúáóì äóÇÑÇğ ÍóÇãöíóÉğ </div><br>  (They will enter into Fire, Hamiyah) meaning, hot with intense heat.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõÓúŞóì ãöäú Úóíúäò ÁóÇäöíóÉò </div><br>  (They will be given to drink from a boiling (Aniyah) spring.) meaning, its heat has reached its maximum limit and boiling point. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíúÓó áóåõãú ØóÚóÇãñ ÅöáÇøó ãöä ÖóÑöíÚò </div><br>  (No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "A tree from the Hellfire.'' Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-Jawza' and Qatadah, all said, "It is Ash-Shibriq (a type of plant).'' Qatadah said, "The Quraysh called it Ash-Shabraq in the spring and Ad-Dari` in the summer.'' `Ikrimah said, "It is a thorny tree which reaches down to the ground.'' Al-Bukhari related that Mujahid said, "Ad-Dari` is a plant that is called Ash-Shibriq. The people of the Hijaz call it Ad-Dari` when it dries, and it is poisonous.'' Ma`mar narrated that Qatadah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíúÓó áóåõãú ØóÚóÇãñ ÅöáÇøó ãöä ÖóÑöíÚò </div><br>  (No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) "This is Ash-Shibriq. When it dries it is called Ad-Dari`.'' Sa`id narrated from Qatadah that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíúÓó áóåõãú ØóÚóÇãñ ÅöáÇøó ãöä ÖóÑöíÚò </div><br>  (No food will there be for them but Dari`,) "This is of the worst, most disgusting and loathsome of foods.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íõÓúãöäõ æóáÇó íõÛúäöì ãöä ÌõæÚò </div><br>  (Which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger.) This means that the intent in eating it will not be achieved, and nothing harmful will be repelled by it.  </div></body></html>
