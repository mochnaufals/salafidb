This is like the exceptions stated in Surat An-Nur, where Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жуб«у нх»ъѕцнду “цнду уехдшу ≈цб«шу бц»хЏхжбу цецдшу √ужъ Ѕу«»у¬∆цецдшу √ужъ Ѕу«»у¬Ѕц »хЏхжбу цецдшу √ужъ √у»ъду¬∆цецдшу √ужъ √у»ъду¬Ѕц »хЏхжбу цецдшу √ужъ ≈цќъжу«дцецдшу √ужъ »удцм ≈цќъжу«дцецдшу √ужъ »удцм √уќужу цецдшу √ужъ дц”у¬∆цецдшу √ужъ гу« губуяу ъ √унъгу№дхехдшу √ужц «б шу№»цЏцнду џунъ—ц √хжъбцм «б≈ц—ъ»у…ц гцду «б—шцћу«бц √ужц «бЎшцЁъбц «бшу–цнду бугъ нуўъеу—хж«ъ Џубум Џужъ—у ц «бдшц”у¬Ѕц</div><br>  (And not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or their right hand possessions, or the Tabi`in among men who do not have desire, or small children who are not aware of the nakedness of women.) (24:31). The Ayah contains more detail than this, which we have already discussed in the Tafsir of the Ayah and do not need to repeat here.  Ibn Jarir recorded that Ash-Sha`bi and `Ikrimah said concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>б«шу ћхду«Ќу Џубунъецдшу Ёцм Ѕу«»у¬∆цецдшу</div><br>  (It is no sin on them before their fathers...) I said, "What about the paternal uncle and the maternal uncle -- why are they not mentioned'' He said: "Because they may describe her to their sons, so it is disliked for a woman to remove her covering in front of her paternal uncle or maternal uncle.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жуб«у дц”у¬∆цецдшу</div><br>  (or their own women,) means that they do not have to observe Hijab in front of other believing women.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жуб«у гу« губуяу ъ √унъгу«дхехдшу</div><br>  (or their (female) slaves.) Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said: "This means female slaves only.''
