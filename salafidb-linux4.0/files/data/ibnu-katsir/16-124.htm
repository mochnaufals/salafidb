The Sabbath was only prescribed for those who differed concerning it, and verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about what they differed over.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Prescription of the Sabbath for the Jews</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  There is no doubt that for every nation, Allah prescribed one day of the week for people to gather to worship Him. For this Ummah He prescribed Friday, because it is the sixth day, on which Allah completed and perfected His creation. On this day He gathered and completed His blessings for His servants. It was said that Allah prescribed this day for the Children of Israel through His Prophet Musa, but they changed it and chose Saturday because it was the day on which the Creator did not create anything, as He had completed His creation on Friday. Allah made observance of the Sabbath obligatory for them in the laws of the Tawrah (Torah), telling them to keep the Sabbath. At the same time, He told them to follow Muhammad when he was sent, and took their promises and covenant to that effect. Hence Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÌõÚöáó ÇáÓøóÈúÊõ Úóáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇú İöíåö</div><br>  (The Sabbath was only prescribed for those who differed concerning it,) Mujahid said: "They observed the Sabbath (Saturday) and ignored Friday.'' Then they continued to observe Saturday until Allah sent `Isa bin Maryam. It was said that he told them to change it to Sunday, and it was also said that he did not forsake the laws of the Tawrah except for a few rulings which were abrogated, and he continued to observe the Sabbath until he was taken up (into heaven). Afterwards, the Christians at the time of Constantine were the ones who changed it to Sunday in order to be different from the Jews, and they started to pray towards the east instead of facing the Dome (i.e., Jerusalem). And Allah knows best. It was reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah heard the Messenger of Allah say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÍúäõ ÇáúÂÎöÑõæäó ÇáÓøóÇÈöŞõæäó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ ÈóíúÏó Ãóäøóåõãú ÃõæÊõæÇ ÇáúßöÊóÇÈó ãöäú ŞóÈúáöäóÇ¡ Ëõãøó åóĞóÇ íóæúãõåõãõ ÇáøóĞöí İóÑóÖó Çááåõ Úóáóíúåöãú İóÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇ İöíåö¡ İóåóÏóÇäóÇ Çááåõ áóåõ¡ İóÇáäøóÇÓõ áóäóÇ İöíåö ÊóÈóÚñ: ÇáúíóåõæÏõ ÛóÏğÇ æóÇáäøóÕóÇÑóì ÈóÚúÏó ÛóÏ»</div><br>  (We are the last, but we will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, even though they were given the Book before us. This is the day that Allah obligated upon them, but they differed concerning it. Allah guided us to this day, and the people observe their days after us, the Jews on the following day and the Christians on the day after that.) This version was recorded by Al-Bukhari. It was reported that Abu Hurayrah and Hudhayfah said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÖóáøó Çááåõ Úóäö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö ãóäú ßóÇäó ŞóÈúáóäóÇ¡ İóßóÇäó áöáúíóåõæÏö íóæúãõ ÇáÓøóÈúÊö¡ æóßóÇäó áöáäøóÕóÇÑóì íóæúãõ ÇáúÃóÍóÏö¡ İóÌóÇÁó Çááåõ ÈöäóÇ İóåóÏóÇäóÇ Çááåõ áöíóæúãö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö¡ İóÌóÚóáó ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉó æóÇáÓøóÈúÊó æóÇáúÃóÍóÏó¡ æóßóĞóáößó åõãú ÊóÈóÚñ áóäóÇ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö äóÍúäõ ÇáúÂÎöÑõæäó ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ æóÇáúÃóæøóáõæäó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ æóÇáúãóŞúÖöíøõ Èóíúäóåõãú ŞóÈúáó ÇáúÎóáóÇÆöŞ»</div><br>  (Allah let the people who came before us stray from Friday, so the Jews had Saturday and the Christians had Sunday. Then Allah brought us and guided us to Friday. So now there are Friday, Saturday and Sunday, thus they will follow us on the Day of Resurrection. We are the last of the people of this world, but will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, and will be the first to be judged, before all of creation.) It was reported by Muslim.  </div></body></html>
