That is, his governors, ministers, leaders and followers among the Egyptians and the Children of Israel. Allah sent him to call them to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, and to forbid them from worshipping anything other than Him. He sent him with mighty signs, such as his hand and his staff, other signs such as the flood, locusts, Qummal, frogs and blood, and the loss of their crops and lives. Yet despite all that they remained arrogant and stubbornly refused to follow him; they rejected his message and made fun of it, and laughed at the one who had brought it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ äõÑöíöåöã ãøöäú ÁóÇíóÉò ÅöáÇøó åöìó ÃóßúÈóÑõ ãöäú ÃõÎúÊöåóÇ</div><br>  (And not an Ayah We showed them but it was greater than its fellow preceding it,) but despite that they would not give up their sin, misguidance, ignorance and confusion. Every time one of these signs came to them, they would go and implore Musa, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåó ÇáÓøóÇÍöÑõ</div><br>  ("O you sorcerer!...'') meaning, expert or knowledgeable one -- this was the view of Ibn Jarir. The scholars of that time were the sorcerers or magicians, and magic was not regarded as something reprehensible by them at that time, so this was not a slight on their part. They were in a state of need, so it would not have been appropriate for them to insult him. This was a way of honoring him, as they thought. On each occasion, they promised Musa that if the torment was lifted from them, they would believe in him and let the Children of Israel go with him, but on each occasion they went back on their word. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáØøõæİóÇäó æóÇáúÌóÑóÇÏó æóÇáúŞõãøóáó æóÇáÖøóİóÇÏöÚó æóÇáÏøóãó ÁóÇíóÜÊò ãøİóÕøóáÇóÊò İóÇÓúÊóßúÈóÑõæÇú æóßóÇäõæÇú ŞóæúãÇğ ãøõÌúÑöãöíäó - æóáóãøóÇ æóŞóÚó Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáÑøöÌúÒõ ŞóÇáõæÇú íóãõæÓóì ÇÏúÚõ áóäóÇ ÑóÈøóßó ÈöãóÇ ÚóåöÏó ÚöäÏóßó áóÆöä ßóÔóİúÊó ÚóäøóÇ ÇáÑøöÌúÒó áóäõÄúãöäóäøó áóßó æóáóäõÑúÓöáóäøó ãóÚóßó Èóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó - İóáóãøóÇ ßóÔóİúäóÇ Úóäúåõãõ ÇáÑøöÌúÒó Åöáóì ÃóÌóáò åõã ÈóÜáöÛõæåõ ÅöĞóÇ åõãú íóäßõËõæäó </div><br>  (So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the Qummal, the frogs, and the blood; manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals. And when the punishment struck them, they said: "O Musa! Invoke your Lord for us because of His promise to you. If you remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the Children of Israel go with you.'' But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! they broke their word!) (7:133-135)  </div></body></html>
