She also said, "I never heard him allow what the people say (lies) except in three cases: in war, bringing peace between people and the man's speech (invented compliments) to his wife and her speech to her husband.'' Umm Kulthum bint `Uqbah was among the immigrant women who gave their pledge of allegiance to the Messenger of Allah . The Group also recorded this Hadith, with the exception of Ibn Majah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Ad-Darda' said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ÃõÎúÈöÑõßõãú ÈöÃóİúÖóáó ãöäú ÏóÑóÌóÉö ÇáÕøöíóÇãö¡ æóÇáÕøóáóÇÉö¡ æóÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉö¿»</div><br>  (Should I tell you what is better than the grade of fasting, praying and Sadaqah)  They said, "Yes, O Allah's Messenger!'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöÕúáóÇÍõ ĞóÇÊö ÇáúÈóíúä»</div><br>  (Bringing reconciliation between people.)

Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih''.

Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÊøóÈöÚú ÛóíúÑó ÓóÈöíáö ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  (and follows other than the believers' way,) refers to a type of conduct that is closely related to contradicting the Messenger . This contradiction could be in the form of contradicting a text (from the Qur'an or Sunnah) or contradicting what the Ummah of Muhammad has agreed on. The Ummah of Muhammad is immune from error when they all agree on something, a miracle that serves to increase their honor, due to the greatness of their Prophet. There are many authentic Hadiths on this subject. Allah warned against the evil of contradicting the Prophet and his Ummah, when He said, e   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äõæóáøöåö ãóÇ Êóæóáøóì æóäõÕúáöåö Ìóåóäøóãó æóÓóÂÁóÊú ãóÕöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell --- what an evil destination!) meaning, when one goes on this wicked path, We will punish him by making the evil path appear good in his heart, and will beautify it for him so that he is tempted further. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞóÑúäöì æóãóä íõßóĞøöÈõ ÈöåóÜĞóÇ ÇáúÍóÏöíËö ÓóäóÓúÊóÏúÑöÌõåõãú ãøöäú ÍóíúËõ áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Then leave Me Alone with such as belie this Qur'an. We shall punish them gradually from directions they perceive not),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÒóÇÛõæÇú ÃóÒóÇÛó Çááøóåõ ŞõáõæÈóåõãú</div><br>  (So when they turned away (from the path of Allah), Allah turned their hearts away), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóĞóÑõåõãú İöì ØõÛúíóÇäöåöãú íóÚúãóåõæäó</div><br>  (And We shall leave them in their trespass to wander blindly). Allah made the Fire the destination of such people in the Hereafter. Indeed, the path of those who avoid the right guidance will only lead to the Fire on the Day of Resurrection, as evident by Allah's statements,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÍúÔõÑõæÇú ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú æóÃóÒúæóÌóåõãú</div><br>  ((It will be said to the angels): "Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions (from the devils)), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÃóì ÇáúãõÌúÑöãõæäó ÇáäøóÇÑó İóÙóäøõæÇú Ãóäøóåõãú ãøõæóÇŞöÚõæåóÇ æóáóãú íóÌöÏõæÇú ÚóäúåóÇ ãóÕúÑöİğÇ </div><br>  (And the criminals, shall see the Fire and apprehend that they have to fall therein. And they will find no way of escape from there).  </div></body></html>
