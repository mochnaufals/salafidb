They say that there is only this life, some people die while others are born to life, without Resurrection or Judgement. This was the creed of Arab idolators who used to deny Resurrection, in addition to, the creed of the atheist philosophers among them who denied the creation and Resurrection. This was also the statement of atheist philosophers who deny the Creator and think that the world will return to its original form once every thirty--six thousand years, when everything will restart its life--cycle again! They claim that this cycle was repeated for infinity, thus contradicting the sound reason and the divine revelation. They said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõåúáößõäóÂ ÅöáÇøó ÇáÏøóåúÑõ</div><br>  (and nothing destroys us except Ad-Dahr (time).) Allah the Exalted said in reply,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ áóåõãú ÈöĞóáößó ãöäú Úöáúãò Åöäú åõãú ÅöáÇøó íóÙõäøõæäó</div><br>  (And they have no knowledge of it, they only presume.) they speculate and guess!  As for the Hadith recorded by the two collectors of the Sahih, and Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i, from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ ÊóÚóÇáóì: íõÄúĞöíäöí ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó¡ íóÓõÈøõ ÇáÏøóåúÑó æóÃóäóÇ ÇáÏøóåúÑõ¡ ÈöíóÏöíó ÇáúÃóãúÑõ¡ ÃõŞóáøöÈõ áóíúáóåõ æóäóåóÇÑóå»</div><br>  (Allah the Exalted says, "The Son of `Adam annoys Me when he curses Ad-Dahr (time), while I am Ad-Dahr. In My Hand are all matters; I cause the alternation of his days and nights.'') In another narration;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÓõÈøõæÇ ÇáÏøóåúÑó İóÅöäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì åõæó ÇáÏøóåúÑ»</div><br>  (Do not curse Ad-Dahr (time), for Allah is Ad-Dahr.) Ash-Shafi`i, Abu `Ubaydah and several other Imams of Tafsir explained the meaning of the Prophet's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÓõÈøõæÇ ÇáÏøóåúÑó İóÅöäøó Çááåó åõæó ÇáÏøóåúÑ»</div><br>  (Do not abuse Ad-Dahr (time), for Allah is Ad-Dahr.) They said, "During the time of Jahiliyyah, when an affliction, a calamity or a disaster struck them, the Arabs used to say, `Woe to Ad-Dahr (time)!' So they used to blame such incidents on Ad-Dahr, cursing Ad-Dahr in the process. Surely, it is Allah the Exalted and Most Honored Who causes these (and all) things to happen. This is why when they cursed Ad-Dahr, it was as if they were cursing Allah Himself, since truthfully, He causes all incidents to happen. Therefore, abusing Ad-Dahr was prohibited due to this consideration, for it was Allah Whom they meant by abusing Ad-Dahr, which -- as we said-- they accused of causing (distressful) incidents.'' This is the best explanation for this subject, and it is the desired meaning. Allah knows best. We should mention that Ibn Hazm and those of the Zahiriyyah like him made an error when they used this Hadith to include Ad-Dahr among Allah's most beautiful Names.
