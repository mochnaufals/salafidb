So when he is given some blessing, he becomes careless, arrogant and ungrateful, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó Åöäøó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó áóíóØúÛóì - Ãóä ÑøóÁóÇåõ ÇÓúÊóÛúäóì </div><br>  (Nay! Verily, man does transgress. Because he considers himself self-sufficient.) (96:6)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöä ÑøõÌøöÚúÊõ Åöáóì ÑóÈøöì Åöäøó áöì ÚöäÏóåõ áóáúÍõÓúäóì</div><br>  (But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely there will be for me the best with Him.) means, `if there is a Hereafter after all, then my Lord will be generous and kind to me just as He was in this world.' So he expects Allah to do him favors in spite of his bad deeds and lack of certain faith. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóäõäóÈøöÆóäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÈöãóÇ ÚóãöáõæÇú æóáóäõĞöíŞóäøóåõãú ãøöäú ÚóĞóÇÈò ÛóáöíÙò</div><br>  (Then, We verily will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment.) Thus Allah threatens punishment and vengeance to those whose conduct and belief is like that.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÂ ÃóäúÚóãúäóÇ Úóáóì ÇáÅäúÓóÜäö ÃóÚúÑóÖó æóäóÃóì ÈöÌóÇäöÈöåö</div><br>  (And when We show favor to man, he turns away and becomes arrogant;) means, he turns away from doing acts of obedience and is too proud to obey the commands of Allah. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóæóáøóì ÈöÑõßúäöåö</div><br>  (But Fir`awn turned away along with his hosts) (51:39).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÓøóåõ ÇáÔøóÑøõ</div><br>  (but when evil touches him,) means, difficulties,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞõæ ÏõÚóÂÁò ÚóÑöíÖò</div><br>  (then he has recourse to long supplications.) means, he asks at length for one thing. Long supplications are those which are long on words and short on meaning. The opposite is concise speech which is brief but full of meaning. And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÓøó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ÇáÖøõÑøõ ÏóÚóÇäóÇ áöÌóäÈöåö Ãóæú ŞóÇÚöÏğÇ Ãóæú ŞóÂÆöãğÇ İóáóãøóÇ ßóÔóİúäóÇ Úóäúåõ ÖõÑøóåõ ãóÑøó ßóÃóä áøóãú íóÏúÚõäóÂ Åöáóì ÖõÑøò ãøóÓøóåõ</div><br>  (And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We have removed his harm from him, he passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!) (10:12)  </div></body></html>
