This is the Ayah indicated in the Hadith of `Irbad bin Sariyah that is better than a thousand Ayat. Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Zamil said, "I mentioned to Ibn `Abbas that I felt something in my heart. He said, `Doubts' and then laughed. Next, he said, `No one can escape this. Allah the Exalted stated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä ßõäÊó İöí Ôóßøò ãøöãøóÂ ÃóäÒóáúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó İóÇÓúÃóáö ÇáøóĞöíäó íóŞúÑóÁõæäó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ãöä ŞóÈúáößó áóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßó ÇáúÍóŞøõ ãöä ÑøóÈøößó</div><br>  (So if you are in doubt concerning that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who are reading the Book before you.

Al-Bukhari said, "Yahya said, `Az-Zahir: knowing all things, Al-Batin: knowing all things.''' Our Shaykh Al-Hafiz Al-Mizzi said, "Yahya is Ibn Ziyad Al-Farra', who authored a book entitled Ma`ani Al-Qur'an.'' There are Hadiths mentioned about this. Among them, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah would recite this supplication while going to bed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó ÑóÈøó ÇáÓøóãæóÇÊö ÇáÓøóÈúÚö¡ æóÑóÈøó ÇáúÚóÑúÔö ÇáúÚóÙöíãö¡ ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÑóÈøó ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò¡ ãõäúÒöáó ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉö æóÇáúÅöäúÌöíáö æóÇáúİõÑúŞóÇäö¡ İóÇáöŞó ÇáúÍóÈøö æóÇáäøóæóì¡ áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ ÃóäúÊó¡ ÃóÚõæĞõ Èößó ãöäú ÔóÑøö ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò ÃóäúÊó ÂÎöĞñ ÈöäóÇÕöíóÊöåö¡ ÃóäúÊó ÇáúÃóæøóáõ áóíúÓó ŞóÈúáóßó ÔóíúÁñ¡ æóÃóäúÊó ÇáúÇÎöÑõ áóíúÓó ÈóÚúÏóßó ÔóíúÁñ¡ æóÃóäúÊó ÇáÙøóÇåöÑõ áóíúÓó İóæúŞóßó ÔóíúÁñ¡ æóÃóäúÊó ÇáúÈóÇØöäõ áóíúÓó Ïõæäóßó ÔóíúÁñ.
