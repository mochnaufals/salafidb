Allah did not reveal religious and legislative laws to any woman from among the daughters of Adam. This is the belief of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. Shaykh Abu Al-Hasan, `Ali bin Isma`il Al-Ash`ari mentioned that it is the view of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah, that there were no female Prophets, but there were truthful believers from among women. Allah mentions the most honorable of the truthful female believers, Maryam, the daughter of `Imran, when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ ÇáúãóÓöíÍõ ÇÈúäõ ãóÑúíóãó ÅöáÇøó ÑóÓõæáñ ŞóÏú ÎóáóÊú ãöä ŞóÈúáöåö ÇáÑøõÓõáõ æóÃõãøõåõ ÕöÏøöíŞóÉñ ßóÇäóÇ íóÃúßõáÇóäö ÇáØøóÚóÇãó</div><br>  (The Messiah 'Isa, son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother was a Siddiqah truthful believer. They both used to eat food.) 5:75 Therefore, the best description Allah gave her is Siddiqah. Had she been a Prophet, Allah would have mentioned this fact when He was praising her qualities and honor. Therefore, Mary was a truthful believer according to the words of the Qur'an. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>All Prophets were Humans not Angels</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ÅöáÇøó ÑöÌóÇáÇğ</div><br>  (And We sent not before you (as Messengers) any but men) "They were not from among the residents of the heaven (angels), as you claimed.''
