So he chose them and proceeded with them in order that they supplicate to their Lord. Their supplication included asking Allah, `O Allah!

Allah disliked this supplication and they were seized with a violent earthquake, Musa said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö áóæú ÔöÆúÊó ÃóåúáóßúÊóåõã ãøöä ŞóÈúáõ æóÅöíøóÜìó</div><br>  ("O my Lord, if it had been Your will, You could have destroyed them and me before.)'''

Muhammad bin Ishaq said, "Musa chose seventy of the best men from the Children of Israel. He said to them, `Go to the meeting with Allah and repent for what you committed. Beg His forgiveness for those of your people whom you left behind. Fast, purify yourselves and clean your clothes.' So, he went with them to Mount Tur in Sinai for the meeting place and time designated by his Lord. He went there only with the leave and knowledge of Allah. According to what has been mentioned to me, when the seventy did what he ordered them to do, and went with him to the meeting of Musa with his Lord, they said, `Request that we may also hear the words of our Lord.' So he replied, `I shall.' When Musa approached the mountain it became completely covered with columns of clouds, Musa approached it and entered in them. He said to the people, `Approach.' But when Allah spoke to Musa, his cloak was surrounded by a brilliant light which no human could bear to look at, so below him a barrier was placed and the people approached. When they entered the cloud they fell prostrate and they heard Him while he was speaking to Musa, commanding him and forbidding him, saying what to do and what not to do. When He completed commanding him, and removed the cloud from Musa, he faced the people and they said, `O Musa! We will not believe in you unless we see Allah directly.' So the thunder shook them, their souls were captured and they all died. Musa stood up invoking, begging and supplicating to his Lord,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö áóæú ÔöÆúÊó ÃóåúáóßúÊóåõã ãøöä ŞóÈúáõ æóÅöíøóÜìó</div><br>  ("O my Lord, if it had been Your will, You could have destroyed them and me before.'')' meaning, `They were foolish. Would You destroy anyone who comes after me from the Children of Israel' Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, Mujahid and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari said, "They were seized by the tremor or lightning, because they neither shunned nor forbade their people who worshipped the calf.'' This is supported by Musa's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊõåúáößõäóÇ ÈöãóÇ İóÚóáó ÇáÓøõİóåóÂÁõ ãöäøóÂ</div><br>  ("would You destroy us for the deeds of the fools among us'') He said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäú åöìó ÅöáÇøó İöÊúäóÊõßó</div><br>  ("It is only Your Fitnah'') affliction, test and trial, according to Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and several among the Salaf and latter scholars. This is the only plausible meaning, in which Musa says, "The decision is Yours (O Allah), and the judgment, and whatever You will occurs. You misguide whom You will, guide whom You will, and none can guide whom You misguide or misguide whom You guide. There is none who can give what You deprive or avert what You give. The sovereignty is all Yours, and Yours is the judgment, the creation and the decision.''

Whenever mercy is mentioned along with forgiveness such as in Musa's supplication to Allah, it includes the hope that Allah does not permit one to fall into that act again.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÊó ÎóíúÑõ ÇáúÛóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  ("for You are the best of those who forgive,'') for none except You can forgive the sin.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇßúÊõÈú áóäóÇ İöì åóÜĞöåö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÍóÓóäóÉğ æóİöí ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö</div><br>  ("And ordain for us good in this world, and in the Hereafter.'') The first part of Musa's supplication was to fend off what should be avoided, while this part is a request for what is sought. The meaning of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇßúÊõÈú áóäóÇ İöì åóÜĞöåö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÍóÓóäóÉğ æóİöí ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö</div><br>  ("And ordain for us good in this world, and in the Hereafter.

Then he prayed behind the Messenger of Allah . When the Messenger of Allah finished the prayer, that man untied his camel mounted it and supplicated aloud, `O Allah! Grant Your mercy to me and to Muhammad, and do not give a share in it to anyone else.'

Imam Ahmad recorded that Salman narrated that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ááåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó ãöÇÆóÉó ÑóÍúãóÉò İóãöäúåóÇ ÑóÍúãóÉñ íóÊóÑóÇÍóãõ ÈöåóÇ ÇáúÎóáúŞõ æóÈöåóÇ ÊóÚúØöİõ ÇáúæõÍõæÔõ Úóáóì ÃóæúáóÇÏöåóÇ æóÃóÎøóÑó ÊöÓúÚóÉğ æóÊöÓúÚöíäó Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, has a hundred mercies.

It was also said that, `the Zakah', here pertains to wealth. It is possible that both meanings are included here, for this Ayah was revealed in Makkah before Zakah in fixed shares was ordained,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõã ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (and those who believe in Our Ayat.), those who have faith in them.  </div></body></html>
