For the earth is dead and lifeless, with nothing growing in it, then He sends to it clouds which bring water, which He sends down upon it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇåúÊóÒøóÊú æóÑóÈóÊú æóÃóäÈóÊóÊú ãöä ßõáøö ÒóæúÌò ÈóåöíÌò</div><br>  (it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth)) (22:5). So too, when Allah wishes to resurrect the bodies, He will send rain from beneath the Throne which will cover the whole earth, and the bodies will grow in their graves like seeds grow in the earth. It says in the Sahih:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáøõ ÇÈúäö ÂÏóãó íóÈúáóì ÅöáøóÇ ÚóÌúÈõ ÇáĞøóäóÈö¡ ãöäúåõ ÎõáöŞó æóãöäúåõ íõÑóßøóÈ»</div><br>  (Every part of the son of Adam will disintegrate apart from the coccyx, from which he was created and from him he will be made anew.) Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó ÇáäøõÔõæÑõ</div><br>  As such (will be) the Resurrection! According to the Háad0th of Abu Raz0n: I said, O Messenger of Alla0h, how will Alla0h bring the dead back to life¿ What is the sign of that in His creation¿ He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÃóÈóÇ ÑóÒöíäò ÃóãóÇ ãóÑóÑúÊó ÈöæóÇÏöí Şóæúãößó ãõãúÍöáğÇ Ëõãøó ãóÑóÑúÊó Èöåö íóåúÊóÒøõ ÎóÖöÑğÇ»</div><br>  (O Abu Razin, do you not pass through the valley of your people (and see it) arid and barren, then you pass through it (and see it) stirred (to life) and green) I said, `Yes.'

This will help him reach his goal, for Allah is the Sovereign of this world and the Hereafter, and to Him belong all honor, power and glory. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÊøóÎöĞõæäó ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÃóæúáöíóÂÁó ãöä Ïõæäö ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÃóíóÈúÊóÛõæäó ÚöäÏóåõãõ ÇáúÚöÒøóÉó İóÅöäøó ÇáÚöÒøóÉó ááøóåö ÌóãöíÚÇğ </div><br>  (Those who take disbelievers for protectors instead of believers, do they seek Al-`Izzah with them Verily, then to Allah belongs all honor, power and glory.)

This was the view of more than one of the Salaf. Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Mukhariq bin Sulaym said that "`Abdullah bin Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said to them, "If we tell you a Hadith, we will bring you proof of it from the Book of Allah. When the Muslim servants says, `Glory and praise be to Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, Allah is Most Great and blessed be Allah,' an angel takes these words and puts them under his wing, then he ascends with them to the heaven. He does not take them past any group of angels but they seek forgiveness for the one who said them, until he brings them before Allah, may He be glorified.'' Then `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóíúåö íóÕúÚóÏõ Çáúßóáöãõ ÇáØøóíøöÈõ æóÇáúÚóãóáõ ÇáÕøóÜáöÍõ íóÑúİóÚõåõ</div><br>  (To Him ascend the good words, and the righteous deeds exalt it).'' Imam Ahmad recorded that An-Nu`man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáøóĞöíäó íóĞúßõÑõæäó Çááåó ãöäú ÌóáóÇáö Çááåö ãöäú ÊóÓúÈöíÍöåö æóÊóßúÈöíÑöåö æóÊóÍúãöíÏöåö æóÊóåúáöíáöåö¡ íóÊóÚóÇØóİúäó Íóæúáó ÇáúÚóÑúÔö áóåõäøó Ïóæöíøñ ßóÏóæöíøö ÇáäøóÍúáö¡ íóĞúßõÑúäó ÈöÕóÇÍöÈöåöäøó¡ ÃóáóÇ íõÍöÈøõ ÃóÍóÏõßõãú Ãóäú áóÇ íóÒóÇáó áóåõ ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ÔóíúÁñ íõĞóßøöÑõ Èöå»</div><br>  (Those who remember Allah and glory Allah by saying, `Glory be to Allah, Allah is most Great, all praise is due to Allah and La ilaha illallah, these words go around the Throne buzzing like bees, mentioning those who said them. Would one of you not like to have something with Allah mentioning him)'' This was also recorded by Ibn Majah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÚóãóáõ ÇáÕøóÜáöÍõ íóÑúİóÚõåõ</div><br>  and the righteous deeds exalt it. Ali bin Abi Táalháah reported that Ibn Abba0s, may Alla0h be pleased with him, said, The good word is the remembrance of Alla0h, may He be exalted, which is taken up to Alla0h, and the righteous deed is the performance of obligatory duties. Whoever remembers Alla0h when doing an obligatory duty, his deed carries his remembrance of Alla0h and takes it up to Alla0h, may He be exalted. Whoever remembers Alla0h and does not perform the obligatory duties, his words will be rejected, as will his deed.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó íóãúßõÑõæäó ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÇÊö</div><br>  but those who plot evils, Muja0hid, Sa 0d bin Jubayr and Shahr bin Háawshab said, This refers to those who show off by their actions, i.e., they deceive the people by giving the impression that they are obeying Alla0h, when in fact they are hated by Alla0h for showing off. Alla0h says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ ÔóÏöíÏñ æóãóßúÑõ ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõæó íóÈõæÑõ</div><br>  (theirs will be severe torment. And the plotting of such will perish.) meaning, it will fail and vanish, for their reality is apparent from up close to those who have insight and wisdom. No one conceals a secret but Allah will cause it to become known, on his face or by a slip of the tongue, or He will cause the person to wear it like a cloak (so that everyone will see it). If it is good, then the consequences will be good, and if it is bad, then the consequences will be bad. The person who shows off cannot continue to deceive anyone but the fool, but the believers who have insight are not deceived by that; from up close, they soon discover it. And nothing at all can be hidden from the Knower of the Unseen (Allah). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah is the Creator and Knower of the Unseen</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÎóáóŞóßõãú ãøöä ÊõÑóÇÈò Ëõãøó ãöä äøõØúİóÉò</div><br>  (And Allah did create you from dust, then from Nutfah,) means, He initiated the creation of your father Adam from dust, then He created his offspring from semen of worthless water.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÌóÚóáóßõãú ÃóÒúæóÌÇğ</div><br>  then He made you pairs. means, male and female, as a kindness and a mercy from Him, He gave you partners from your own kind, that you may find repose in them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊóÍúãöáõ ãöäú ÃõäúËóì æóáÇó ÊóÖóÚõ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÚöáúãöåö</div><br>  (And no female conceives or gives birth but with His knowledge.) means, He knows about that and nothing is hidden from Him at all, but,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊóÓúŞõØõ ãöä æóÑóŞóÉò ÅöáÇøó íóÚúáóãõåóÇ æóáÇó ÍóÈøóÉò İöì ÙõáõãóÜÊö ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóáÇó ÑóØúÈò æóáÇó íóÇÈöÓò ÅöáÇøó İöì ßöÊóÜÈò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (not a leaf falls, but He knows it.

It was reported via Al- Awfi that Ibn Abba0s said concerning the A0yah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõÚóãøóÑõ ãöä ãøõÚóãøóÑò æóáÇó íõäŞóÕõ ãöäú ÚõãõÑöåö ÅöáÇøó İöì ßöÊóÜÈò Åöäøó Ğóáößó Úóáóì Çááøóåö íóÓöíÑñ</div><br>  (And no aged man is granted a length of life nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Book. Surely, that is easy for Allah.) There is no one for whom Allah has decreed a long life but he will reach the age that has been decreed for him. When he reaches the time that has been decreed for him, he will not surpass it. And there is no one for whom Allah has decreed a short life but it will end when he reaches the age that has been decreed for him. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõäŞóÕõ ãöäú ÚõãõÑöåö ÅöáÇøó İöì ßöÊóÜÈò Åöäøó Ğóáößó Úóáóì Çááøóåö íóÓöíÑñ</div><br>  (nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Book. Surely, that is easy for Allah.) He said, "That is recorded in a Book with Him.'' This was also the view of Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim. On the other hand, some of them said, "The phrase   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõÚóãøóÑõ ãöä ãøõÚóãøóÑò</div><br>  (And no aged man is granted a length of life) means, what He decrees for him of life, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõäŞóÕõ ãöäú ÚõãõÑöåö</div><br>  nor is a part cut off from his life means, his time is constantly decreasing. All of this is known to Alla0h year after year, month after month, week after week, day after day, hour after hour. Everything is written with Alla0h in His Book. This was reported by Ibn Jar0r from Abu Ma0lik, and was also the view of As-Suddi and Atáa0 Al-Khura0sa0ni. In the Tafsir of this Ayah, An-Nasa'i recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÓóÑøóåõ Ãóäú íõÈúÓóØó áóåõ İöí ÑöÒúŞöåö æóíõäúÓóÃó áóåõ İöí ÃóËóÑöåö İóáúíóÕöáú ÑóÍöãóå»</div><br>  (Whoever would like to have ample provision and a long life, let him uphold the ties of kinship.)''
