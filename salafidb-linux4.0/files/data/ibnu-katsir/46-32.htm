"They were at a place called Nakhlah while Allah's Messenger was performing the `Isha' prayer, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇÏõæÇú íóßõæäõæäó Úóáóíúåö áöÈóÏÇğ</div><br>  (they crowded on top of each other to hear him.) (72:19)'' Sufyan said, "They stood on top of each other like piled wool.'' Ahmad was alone in recording this. Imam Ahmad and the famous Imam, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Bayhaqi in his book Dala'il An-Nubuwwah, both recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Allah's Messenger never recited Qur'an to the Jinns, nor did he see them. Allah's Messenger was heading with a group of his Companions towards the `Ukaz market. At that time, the devils had been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and they were being attacked by burning flames (whenever they tried to listen). When the devils went back to their people, they asked them what happened to them, and they answered, `We have been prevented from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens, and burning flames now attack us.' Their people told them, `You have only been prevented from eavesdropping on the information of the heavens because of something (major) that has happened. So go all over the earth, east and west, and see what is it that has obstructed you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' Thus they traveled all over the earth, east and west, seeking that which had obstructed them from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens. A group of them went towards Tihamah, and found Allah's Messenger while he was at a place called Nakhlah along the way to the `Ukaz market. He was leading his Companions in the Fajr prayer. When the Jinns heard the recitation of the Qur'an, they stopped to listen to it, and then they said: `By Allah! This is what has prevented you from eavesdropping on the news of the heavens.' Then they returned to their people and told them: `Our people! We certainly have heard an amazing recitation (the Qur'an), it guides to the right path. So we have believed in it, and we will join none in worship with our Lord.' So Allah revealed to His Prophet ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃõæÍöìó Åöáóìøó Ãóäøóåõ ÇÓúÊóãóÚó äóİóÑñ ãøöäó ÇáúÌöäøö</div><br>  (Say: It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinns have listened (to the Qur'an).) (72:19) Thus, what was revealed to him was only the saying of the Jinns.'' Al-Bukhari recorded a similar narration, and Muslim recorded it (as it is here). At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, as did An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud reported that the Jinns came down upon the Prophet while he was reciting the Qur'an at a place called Nakhlah. When they heard him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóäÕöÊõæÇú</div><br>  (They said: "Listen quietly.'') meaning, hush! They were nine in number, and one of them was called Zawba`ah. So Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ÕóÑóİúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó äóİóÑÇğ ãøöäó ÇáúÌöäøö íóÓúÊóãöÚõæäó ÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäó İóáóãøóÇ ÍóÖóÑõæåõ ŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóäÕöÊõæÇú İóáóãøóÇ ŞõÖöìó æóáøóæúÇú Åöáóì Şóæúãöåöã ãøõäĞöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And when We sent toward you a group of Jinns, to listen to the Qur'an. When they attended it, they said: "Listen quietly!'' And when it was concluded, they returned to their people as warners.) until His saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÖóáóÜáò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  ( manifest error.) Thus, this report along with the above one by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, indicate that Allah's Messenger was not aware of the presence of the Jinns at that time. They only listened to his recitation and went back to their people. Later on, they came to him in groups, one party after another, and one group after another. As for Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáøóæúÇú Åöáóì Şóæúãöåöã ãøõäĞöÑöíäó</div><br>  (they returned to their people as warners.) It means that they went back to their people and warned them about what they heard from Allah's Messenger . This is similar to Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíóÊóİóŞøóåõæÇú İöì ÇáÏøöíäö æóáöíõäĞöÑõæÇú Şóæúãóåõãú ÅöĞóÇ ÑóÌóÚõæÇú Åöáóíúåöãú áóÚóáøóåõãú íóÍúĞóÑõæäó</div><br>  (...that they may obtain understanding in religion and warn their people when they return to them, so that they might be cautious (of evil).) (9:122) This Ayah has been used as evidence that the Jinns have warners from among themselves, but no Messengers. There is no doubt that Allah did not send Messengers from among the Jinns, because He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ÅöáÇøó ÑöÌóÇáÇğ äøõæÍöì Åöáóíúåöãú ãøöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúŞõÑóì</div><br>  (And We did not send before you as Messengers any but men, to whom We revealed from among the people of cities.) (12:109) And Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ŞóÈúáóßó ãöäó ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíäó ÅöáÇøó Åöäøóåõãú áóíóÃúßõáõæäó ÇáØøóÚóÇãó æóíóãúÔõæäó İöì ÇáÇøñÓúæóÇŞö</div><br>  (And We never sent before you any of the Messengers but verily they ate food and walked in the markets.) (25:20) And He says about Ibrahim Al-Khalil, upon him be peace,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöì ĞõÑøöíøóÊöåö ÇáäøõÈõæøóÉó æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (...And We placed in his descendants prophethood and Scripture.)(29:27) Thus, every Prophet whom Allah sent after Ibrahim was from his offspring and progeny. As for Allah's saying in Surat Al-An`am,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜãóÚúÔóÑó ÇáúÌöäøö æóÇáÅöäúÓö Ãóáóãú íóÃúÊößõãú ÑõÓõáñ ãøöäúßõãú</div><br>  (O company of Jinns and human beings! Did there not come to you Messengers from among you) (6:130) It only applies to the two kinds collectively, but specifically pertains to just one of them, which is the human. This is like Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÎúÑõÌõ ãöäúåõãóÇ ÇáøõáÄúáõÄõ æóÇáãóÑúÌóÇäõ </div><br>  (From both of them (salty and fresh waters) emerge pearl and Marjan.) (55:22) Although He said "both of them'' this applies to only one of the two types of water (the salty water). Allah then explains how the Jinns warned their people. He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú íŞóæúãóäóÂ ÅöäøóÇ ÓóãöÚúäóÇ ßöÊóÜÈÇğ ÃõäÒöáó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãõæÓóì</div><br>  (They said: "O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa...'') They did not mention `Isa, peace be upon him, because the Injil that was revealed to him contained admonitions and exhortations, but very few permissions or prohibitions. Thus, it was in reality like a complement to the legislation of the Tawrah, the Tawrah being the reference. That is why they said, "Sent down after Musa.'' This is also the way that Waraqah bin Nawfal spoke when the Prophet told him about his first meeting with Jibril, An-Namus, peace be upon him. He said: "Very good, very good! This is (the angel) that used to come to Musa. I wish that I was still a young man (to support you).''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÕóÏøöŞÇğ áøöãóÇ Èóíúäó íóÏóíúåö</div><br>  (confirming what came before it,) meaning, the Scriptures that were revealed before it to the previous Prophets. They then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóåúÏöì Åöáóì ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (it guides to the truth) means in belief and information.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöáóì ØóÑöíŞò ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò</div><br>  (and to the straight path.) which means, in deeds. For verily, the Qur'an contains two things: information and commandments. Its information is true, and its commandments are all just, as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóãøóÊú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó ÕöÏúŞÇğ æóÚóÏúáÇğ</div><br>  (And the Word of Your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice.) (6:115) Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöí ÃóÑúÓóáó ÑóÓõæáóåõ ÈöÇáúåõÏóì æóÏöíäö ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (It is He Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth.) (9:122) The guidance is the beneficent knowledge, and the religion of truth means the righteous good deeds. Thus, the Jinns said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóåúÏöì Åöáóì ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (it guides to the truth) in matters of belief,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöáóì ØóÑöíŞò ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò</div><br>  (and to the straight path.) meaning, in regard to actions.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íŞóæúãóäóÂ ÃóÌöíÈõæÇú ÏóÇÚöìó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (O our people! Respond to Allah's Caller,) This is proof that Muhammad has been sent to both the human beings and the Jinns. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÌöíÈõæÇú ÏóÇÚöìó Çááøóåö æóÁóÇãöäõæÇú Èöåö</div><br>  (Respond to Allah's Caller and believe in him.) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÛúİöÑú áóßõãú ãøöä ĞõäõæÈößõãú</div><br>  (He will then forgive you some of your sins,) Some scholars say that "some'' here is auxiliary, but this is questionable since it is rarely used to strengthen an affirmative meaning. Others say that it means partial forgiveness.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÌöÑúßõãú ãøöäú ÚóĞóÇÈò Ãóáöíãò</div><br>  (and protect you from a painful torment.) meaning, He will protect you from His painful punishment. Then Allah informs that they said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä áÇøó íõÌöÈú ÏóÇÚöìó Çááøóåö İóáóíúÓó ÈöãõÚúÌöÒò İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖó</div><br>  (And whosoever does not respond to Allah's Caller, he cannot escape on earth,) meaning, Allah's power encompasses him and surrounds him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóíúÓó áóåõ ãöä Ïõæäöåö ÃóæúáöíóÂÁõ</div><br>  (and he will not have besides Allah any protectors.) meaning, no one can protect him against Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó İöì ÖóáóÜáò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (Those are in manifest error. ) This is a threat and warning. Thus, those Jinns called their people with encouragement and warning. Because of this, many of the Jinns took heed and came to Allah's Messenger in successive delegations; and verily, Allah is worthy of all praise and gratitude, and Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
