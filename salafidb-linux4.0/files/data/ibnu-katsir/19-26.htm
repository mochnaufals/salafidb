Others recited it as,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÂ</div><br>  (from below her) With the meaning of a preposition (from) instead of a pronoun (who). The scholars of Tafsir have differed over the interpretation of who was calling out. Al-`Awfi and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóäóÇÏóÇåóÇ ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÂ</div><br>  (Then cried unto her from below her,) "This is referring to Jibrilbecause `Isa did not speak until she brought him to her people.'' Similarly, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, `Amr bin Maymun, As-Suddi and Qatadah all said, "Verily, this is referring to the angel Jibril.'' This means that he (Jibril) called out to her from the bottom of the valley. Mujahid said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóäóÇÏóÇåóÇ ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÂ</div><br>  (Then cried unto her from below her,) "This is referring to `Isa bin Maryam.'' Likewise, `Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ma`mar that Qatadah said that Al-Hasan said, "This is referring to her son (`Isa).'' This is also one of the two opinions reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr -- that it was her son, `Isa, speaking. Sa`id said, "Have you not heard Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÔóÇÑóÊú Åöáóíúåö</div><br>  (Then she pointed to him.) Ibn Zayd and Ibn Jarir preferred this opinion in his Tafsir. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇøó ÊóÍúÒóäöì</div><br>  (Grieve not:) He called to her saying, "Do not grieve.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÌóÚóáó ÑóÈøõßö ÊóÍúÊóßö ÓóÑöíøÇğ</div><br>  (your Lord has provided a Sariy under you.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Shu`bah reported from Abu Ishaq that Al-Bara' bin `Azib said, s   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÌóÚóáó ÑóÈøõßö ÊóÍúÊóßö ÓóÑöíøÇğ</div><br>  (your Lord has provided a Sariy under you.) "This means a small stream.'' Likewise, `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "Sariy means a river.'' `Amr bin Maymun held the same view, as he said, "It means a river for her to drink from.'' Mujahid said, "It means river in the Syrian language.'' Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "Sariy is a small flowing river.'' Others said that Sariy refers to `Isa. This was said by Al-Hasan, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin `Abbad bin Ja`far, and it is one of the two opinions reported from Qatadah. It is also the view of `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. However, the first view seems to be the most obvious meaning. For this reason, Allah said after it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõÒøöì Åöáóíúßö ÈöÌöĞúÚö ÇáäøóÎúáóÉö</div><br>  (And shake the trunk of date palm towards you,) meaning, "Grab the trunk of the date-palm tree and shake it towards yourself.'' Therefore, Allah blessed her by giving her food and drink. Then He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõÓóÜŞöØú Úóáóíúßö ÑõØóÈÇğ ÌóäöíøÇğİóßõáöì æóÇÔúÑóÈöì æóŞóÑøöì ÚóíúäÇğ</div><br>  (It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. So eat and drink and rejoice.) Meaning to be happy. This is why `Amr bin Maymun said, "Nothing is better for the woman confined in childbed than dried dates and fresh dates.'' Then he recited this noble Ayah. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöãøóÇ ÊóÑóíöäøó ãöäó ÇáÈóÔóÑö ÃóÍóÏÇğ</div><br>  (And if you see any human being,) This means any person that you see,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞõæáöì Åöäøöì äóĞóÑúÊõ áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÕóæúãÇğ İóáóäú Ãõßóáøöãó Çáúíóæúãó ÅöäÓöíøÇğ</div><br>  (Say: `Verily, I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious (Allah) so I shall not speak to any human being today.') Meaning, by signaling with gestures, not a statement by speech. This is so that she does not negate her oath itself,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóäú Ãõßóáøöãó Çáúíóæúãó ÅöäÓöíøÇğ</div><br>  (so I shall not speak to any human being today. ) Anas bin Malik commented on,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì äóĞóÑúÊõ áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÕóæúãÇğ</div><br>  (I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious) He said; "A vow of silence.'' Likewise said Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak. The meaning here is that in their Law, when fasting, it was forbidden for them to eat and speak. As-Suddi, Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd have all stated this view. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said, "When `Isa said to Maryam,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇøó ÊóÍúÒóäöì</div><br>  (Grieve not) She said, `How can I not grieve when you are with me and I have no husband nor am I an owned slave woman What excuse do I have with the people Woe unto me, if I had only died before this, and had been a thing forgotten and unknown.' Then, `Isa said to her, `I will suffice you with a statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöãøóÇ ÊóÑóíöäøó ãöäó ÇáÈóÔóÑö ÃóÍóÏÇğ İóŞõæáöì Åöäøöì äóĞóÑúÊõ áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÕóæúãÇğ İóáóäú Ãõßóáøöãó Çáúíóæúãó ÅöäÓöíøÇğ</div><br>  (And if you see any human being, say: `Verily, I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious so I shall not speak to any human being this day.')' All of this is from the speech of `Isa to his mother.'' Wahb said the same as well.  </div></body></html>
