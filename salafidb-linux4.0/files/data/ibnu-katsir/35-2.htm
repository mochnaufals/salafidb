Whatever of mercy, Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it; and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter.

None can give what He withholds, and none can withhold what He gives. Imam Ahmad recorded that Warrad, the freed slave of Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah, said, "Mu`awiyah wrote to Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah, saying, `Write for me what you heard from the Messenger of Allah .' So Al-Mughirah called me and I wrote for him: `I heard the Messenger of Allah say when he finished praying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ æóÍúÏóåõ áóÇ ÔóÑöíßó áóåõ¡ áóåõ Çáúãõáúßõ æóáóåõ ÇáúÍóãúÏõ¡ æóåõæó Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóíúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ¡ Çááúåõãøó áóÇ ãóÇäöÚó áöãóÇ ÃóÚúØóíúÊó æóáóÇ ãõÚúØöíó áöãóÇ ãóäóÚúÊó¡ æóáóÇ íóäúİóÚõ ĞóÇ ÇáúÌóÏøö ãöäúßó ÇáúÌóÏ»</div><br>  (There is no god (worthy of worship) except Allah alone, with no partner or associate. To Him be praise and dominion, and He is able to do all things. O Allah, there is none who can withhold what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and and good fortune and richness in anything cannot benefit one against Your will.) `And I heard him forbid gossiping, asking too many questions and wasting money, burying girls alive, disobeying one's mother, and withholding from others while asking from them.''' This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim, with several chain of narration. It was recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "When the Messenger of Allah raised his head from bowing, he would say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóãöÚó Çááåõ áöãóäú ÍóãöÏóåõ¡ Çááúåõãøó ÑóÈøóäóÇ áóßó ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ãöáúÁõ ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ æóãöáúÁõ ãóÇ ÔöÆúÊó ãöäú ÔóíúÁò ÈóÚúÏõ¡ Çááúåõãøó Ãóåúáó ÇáËøóäóÇÁö æóÇáúãóÌúÏö¡ÃóÍóŞøõ ãóÇ ŞóÇáó ÇáúÚóÈúÏõ æóßõáøõäóÇ áóßó ÚóÈúÏñ¡ Çááúåõãøó áóÇ ãóÇäöÚó áöãóÇ ÃóÚúØóíúÊó æóáóÇ ãõÚúØöíó áöãóÇ ãóäóÚúÊó¡ æóáóÇ íóäúİóÚõ ĞóÇ ÇáúÌóÏøö ãöäúßó ÇáúÌóÏ»</div><br>  (Allah hears those who praise Him. O Allah, our Lord, to You be praise, filling the heavens and the earth, and filling whatever You wish besides. O Allah, the One deserving praise and glory. The truest words that any servant says -- and all of us are Your servants -- are: O Allah, there is none who can withhold what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and no wealth or majesty can benefit anyone against Your will.)'' This Ayah is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä íóãúÓóÓúßó Çááøóåõ ÈöÖõÑøò İóáÇó ßóÇÔöİó áóåõ ÅöáÇøó åõæó æóÅöä íõÑöÏúßó ÈöÎóíúÑò İóáÇó ÑóÂÏøó áöİóÖúáöåö</div><br>  (And if Allah touches you with harm, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His favor) (10:107).
