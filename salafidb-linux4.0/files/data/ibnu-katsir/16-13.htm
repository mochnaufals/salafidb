Each of (these heavenly bodies) travels in its own orbit, which Allah has ordained for it, and travels in the manner prescribed for it, without deviating in any way. All of them are under His subjugation, His control and His decree, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßõãõ Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó İöí ÓöÊøóÉö ÃóíøóÇãò Ëõãøó ÇÓúÊóæóì Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÑúÔö íõÛúÔöì Çáøóíúáó ÇáäøóåóÇÑó íóØúáõÈõåõ ÍóËöíËğÇ æóÇáÔøóãúÓó æóÇáúŞóãóÑó æóÇáäøõÌõæãó ãõÓóÎøóÑóÊò ÈöÃóãúÑöåö ÃóáÇó áóåõ ÇáúÎóáúŞõ æóÇáÇøñãúÑõ ÊóÈóÇÑóßó Çááøóåõ ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose (Istawa) over the Throne.
