Therefore, you will not be asked about the deeds or wickedness of those who receive it.'' This is a sound meaning indicating that when one spends in charity for Allah's sake, then his reward will be with Allah. He will not be asked if the charity unintentionally reached righteous, evil, deserving or undeserving persons, for he will be rewarded for his good intention. The proof to this statement is the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊõäİöŞõæÇú ãöäú ÎóíúÑò íõæóİøó Åöáóíúßõãú æóÃóäÊõãú áÇó ÊõÙúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.)

Rather, the Miskin is he who neither has enough resources to sustain him, all the while people are unaware of his need so they do not give to him, nor does he ask people for anything.)  Imam Ahmad also recorded this Hadith from Ibn Mas`ud.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÚúÑöİõåõã ÈöÓöíãóÜåõãú</div><br>  (You may know them by their mark) means, "Those who have good minds discover their situation,'' just as Allah said in other instances,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓöíãóÜåõãú İöì æõÌõæåöåöãú</div><br>  (The mark of them (i.e. of their faith) is on their faces) 48:29, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÊóÚúÑöİóäøóåõãú İöì áóÍúäö ÇáúŞóæúáö</div><br>  (But surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!) 47:30.

Indeed, those who ask people for help, while having what suffices for their needs, have begged.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id said, "My mother sent me to the Messenger of Allah to ask him for help, but when I came by him I sat down. The Prophet faced me and said to me,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäö ÇÓúÊóÛúäóì ÃóÛúäóÇåõ Çááåõ¡ æóãóäö ÇÓúÊóÚóİøó ÃóÚóİøóåõ Çááåõ¡ æóãóäö ÇÓúÊóßóİøó ßóİóÇåõ Çááåõ¡ æóãóäú ÓóÃóáó æóáóåõ ŞöíãóÉõ ÃõæŞöíøóÉò İóŞóÏú ÃóáúÍóİ»</div><br>  (Whoever felt satisfied, then Allah will enrich him. Whoever is modest, Allah will make him decent. Whoever is content, then Allah will suffice for him. Whoever asks people, while having a small amout, he will have begged the people.)  Abu Sa`id said, "I said to myself, `I have a camel, Al-Yaqutah, and indeed, it is worth more than a small amount.' And I went back without asking the Prophet for anything.'' This is the same wording for this Hadith collected by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i.

On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.)  This Ayah praises those who spend in charity for Allah's sake, seeking His pleasure, day and night, publicly and in secret, including what one spends on his family. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah said to Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÅöäøóßó áóäú ÊõäúİöŞó äóİóŞóÉğ ÊóÈúÊóÛöí ÈöåóÇ æóÌúåó Çááåö ÅöáøóÇ ÇÒúÏóÏúÊó ÈöåóÇ ÏóÑóÌóÉğ æóÑöİúÚóÉğ¡ ÍóÊøóì ãóÇ ÊóÌúÚóáõ İöí İöí ÇãúÑóÃóÊöß»</div><br>  (You will not spend charity with which you seek Allah's Face, but you will ascend a higher degree and status because of it, including what you put in your wife's mouth.)
