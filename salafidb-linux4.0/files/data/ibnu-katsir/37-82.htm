Only a few of Nuh's people believed in him, despite the long period of time he spent among them. He stayed among them for one thousand years less fifty, and after he stayed among them for so long and their disbelief became too much for him to bear -- for every time he called them, they turned away from him even more -- he prayed to his Lord saying, "I have been overcome, so help (me)!'' So Allah became angry because Nuh was angry with them. He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú äóÇÏóÇäóÇ äõæÍñ İóáóäöÚúãó ÇáúãõÌöíÈõæäó </div><br>  (And indeed Nuh invoked Us, and We are the best of those who answer.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÌøóíúäóÜåõ æóÃóåúáóåõ ãöäó ÇáúßóÑúÈö ÇáúÚóÙöíãö </div><br>  (And We rescued him and his family from the great distress.) means, their disbelief and their insults.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõ åõãõ ÇáúÈóÜŞöíäó </div><br>  (And, his progeny, them We made the survivors.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, "There was no one left apart from the offspring of Nuh, peace be upon him.'' Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah said, narrating from Qatadah concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõ åõãõ ÇáúÈóÜŞöíäó </div><br>  (And, his progeny, them We made the survivors.) "All people descended from the offspring of Nuh, peace be upon him.'' At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Samurah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet said, concerning the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõ åõãõ ÇáúÈóÜŞöíäó </div><br>  (And, his progeny, them We made the survivors):   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóÇãõ¡ æóÍóÇãõ¡ æóíóÇİöË»</div><br>  (Sam, Ham and Yafith.) Imam Ahmad recorded from Samurah, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóÇãõ ÃóÈõæ ÇáúÚóÑóÈö¡ æóÍóÇãõ ÃóÈõæ ÇáúÍóÈóÔö¡ æóíóÇİöËõ ÃóÈõæ ÇáÑøõæã»</div><br>  (Sam was the father of the Arabs, Ham was the father of the Ethiopians and Yafith was the father of the Romans.)'' This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi. What is meant here by Romans is the original Romans, i.e., the Greeks who claimed descent from Ruma (Roma) the son of Liti, the son of Yunan, the son of Yafith, the son of Nuh, peace be upon him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóßúäóÇ Úóáóíúåö İöì ÇáÇøñÎöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And left for him among the later generations. ) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "He is remembered in a good way.'' Mujahid said this means "An honorable mention by all the Prophets.'' Qatadah and As-Suddi said, "Allah caused him to be praised constantly by others.'' Ad-Dahhak said it means "Salam and praise.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóáóÜãñ Úóáóì äõæÍò İöì ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (Salam (peace!) be upon Nuh among the all creatures!) This explains for us the extent of the honorable mention and praise, for he is greeted with peace by all groups and nations.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ßóĞóáößó äóÌúÒöì ÇáúãõÍúÓöäöíäó </div><br>  (Verily, thus We reward the gooddoers.) means, `This is how We reward those of Our servants who do deeds of obedience to Allah. We gave him an honorable mention so that after he died he is still remembered in a manner that befits his status.' Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöäóÇ ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (Verily, he Nuh was one of Our believing servants.) meaning, one of the sincere believers in the Oneness of Allah, one of those who had certain faith.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÃóÛúÑóŞúäóÇ ÇáÇøñÎóÑöíäó </div><br>  (Then We drowned the others. ) means, `We destroyed them, and there was no trace whatsoever left of them, and they are only known by this unfavorable description.'  </div></body></html>
