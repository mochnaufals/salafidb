Consequently, even if the angels descend, while the disbelievers still had the same attitude, then the torment will surely befall them from Allah as a consequence. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ äõäóÒøöáõ ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉó ÅöáÇøó ÈöÇáÍóŞøö æóãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú ÅöĞğÇ ãøõäÙóÑöíäó </div><br>  (We send not the angels down except with the truth (i.e. for torment, etc.), and in that case, they (the disbelievers) would have no respite!) 15:8, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÑóæúäó ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉó áÇó ÈõÔúÑóì íóæúãóÆöĞò áøöáúãõÌúÑöãöíäó</div><br>  (On the Day they will see the angels, no glad tidings will there be for the criminals that day.) 25:22 Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÌóÚóáúäóÜåõ ãóáóßÇğ áøóÌóÚóáúäóÜåõ ÑóÌõáÇğ æóáóáóÈóÓúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöã ãøóÇ íóáúÈöÓõæäó </div><br>  (And had We appointed him an angel, We indeed would have made him a man, and We would have certainly caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion.) meaning, if We send an angel along with the human Messenger, or if We send an angel as a Messenger to mankind, he would be in the shape of a man so that they would be able to speak to him and benefit from his teachings. In this case, the angel (in the shape of a human) will also cause confusion for them, just as the confusion they caused themselves over accepting humans as Messengers! Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõá áóæú ßóÇäó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ãóáóÜÆößóÉñ íóãúÔõæäó ãõØúãóÆöäøöíäó áóäóÒøóáúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöã ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ãóáóßğÇ ÑøóÓõæáÇğ </div><br>  (Say: "If there were on the earth, angels walking about in peace and security, We should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger.'') 17:95 It is a mercy from Allah to His creation that He sends every type of creation, Messengers from among their kind, so that they are able to call their people to Allah, and their people able to talk to them, ask them and benefit from them. In another Ayah, Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ãóäøó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄãöäöíäó ÅöĞú ÈóÚóËó İöíåöãú ÑóÓõæáÇğ ãøöäú ÃóäİõÓöåöãú íóÊúáõæÇú Úóáóíúåöãú ÁóÇíóÜÊöåö æóíõÒóßøöíåöãú</div><br>  (Indeed Allah conferred a great favor on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting unto them His verses (the Qur'an), and purifying them.) 3:164 Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah 6:9 above, "If an angel was sent to them, he would come in the shape of a man. This is because they will not be able to look at the angel due to light.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóáóÈóÓúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöã ãøóÇ íóáúÈöÓõæäó</div><br>  (... and We would have certainly caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion. ) meaning, We would confuse them over their confusion. And Al-Walibi reported Ibn `Abbas saying; "We brought doubts around them.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏö ÇÓúÊõåúÒöìÁó ÈöÑõÓõáò ãøöä ŞóÈúáößó İóÍóÇŞó ÈöÇáøóĞöíäó ÓóÎöÑõæÇú ãöäúåõãú ãøóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú Èöåö íóÓúÊóåúÒöÁõæäó </div><br>  (And indeed Messengers were mocked before you, but their scoffers were surrounded by the very thing that they used to mock at.) comforts the Messenger concerning the denial of him by his people. The Ayah also promises the Messenger , and his believers, of Allah's victory and the good end in this life and the Hereafter. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÓöíÑõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö Ëõãøó ÇäúÙõÑõæÇú ßóíúİó ßóÇäó ÚóÜŞöÈóÉõ ÇáúãõßóĞøöÈöíäó </div><br>  (Say: "Travel in the land and see what was the end of those who rejected truth.'') meaning, contemplate about yourselves and think about the afflictions Allah struck the previous nations with, those who defied His Messengers and denied them. Allah sent torment, afflictions and punishment on them in this life, as well as the painful torment in the Hereafter, while saving His Messengers and believing servants.  </div></body></html>
