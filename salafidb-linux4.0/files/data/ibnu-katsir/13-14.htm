Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, and Malik who narrated it from Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir, said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõ ÏóÚúæóÉõ ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (For Him is the Word of Truth.) means, "La ilaha illallah.'' Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó íóÏúÚõæäó ãöä Ïõæäöåö</div><br>  (And those whom they invoke besides Him...), meaning, the example of those who worship others besides Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÈóÜÓöØö ßóİøóíúåö Åöáóì ÇáúãóÂÁö áöíóÈúáõÛó İóÇåõ</div><br>  (like one who stretches forth his hand for water to reach his mouth,) `Ali bin Abi Talib commented, "Like he who stretches his hand on the edge of a deep well to reach the water, even though his hands do not reach it; so how can the water reach his mouth'' Mujahid said about,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÈóÜÓöØö ßóİøóíúåö</div><br>  (like one who stretches forth his hand) "Calling the water with his words and pointing at it, but it will never come to him this way.'' The meaning of this Ayah is that he who stretches his hand to water from far away, to either collect some or draw some from far away, will not benefit from the water which will not reach his mouth, where water should be consumed. Likewise, those idolators who call another deity besides Allah, will never benefit from these deities in this life or the Hereafter, hence Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÏõÚóÂÁõ ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÅöáÇøó İöì ÖóáóÜáò</div><br>  (and the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing but misguidance.)  </div></body></html>
