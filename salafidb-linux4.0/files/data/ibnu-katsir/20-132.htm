For verily, it is only short-lived splendor and a feeble bounty, which We are using to test them with. And very few of My servants are truly thankful.'' Mujahid said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÒúæóÌÇğ ãøöäúåõãú</div><br>  (various groups of them,) "This means the wealthy people.'' This means, "Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad) better than that which We have given them.'' This is just as Allah says in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÁÇÊóíúäóÜßó ÓóÈúÚğÇ ãøöäó ÇáúãóËóÇäöí æóÇáúŞõÑúÁóÇäó ÇáúÚóÙöíãó áÇó ÊóãõÏøóäøó Úóíúäóíúßó</div><br>  (And indeed, We have bestowed upon you seven repeatedly recited verses, and the Grand Qur'an. Look not with your eyes ambitiously.) 15:87-88 Likewise, that which Allah has stored for His Messenger in the Hereafter is something extremely great. It is an unlimited reward that cannot be described. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÓóæúİó íõÚúØöíßó ÑóÈøõßó İóÊóÑúÖóì </div><br>  (And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.) 93:5 For this reason, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑöÒúŞõ ÑóÈøößó ÎóíúÑñ æóÃóÈúŞóì</div><br>  (But the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting. ) In the Sahih it is recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab entered upon the Messenger of Allah while he was in the small room in which he had separated himself from his wives after he had vowed to stay away from them. When he came in, he saw him (the Prophet ) lying down upon a sandy straw mat. There was nothing in the house except a pile of sant tree pods and some hanging equipment. `Umar's eyes filled with tears (upon seeing this), so the Messenger of Allah said to him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇíõÈúßöíßó íóÇ ÚõãóÑõ¿»</div><br>  (What makes you cry, O Umar) He replied, "O Messenger of Allah, verily Kisra and Caesar are living in their luxurious conditions, yet you are the chosen Friend of Allah amongst His creation'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóæó İöí Ôóßó ÃóäúÊó íóÇ ÇÈúäó ÇáúÎóØøóÇÈö¿ ÃõæáóÆößó Şóæúãñ ÚõÌøöáóÊú áóåõãú ØóíøöÈóÇÊõåõãú İöí ÍóíóÇÊöåöãõ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ»</div><br>  (Do you have doubt, O son of Al-Khattab Those people have had their good hastened for them in the life of this world.) Thus, the Prophet was the most abstinent of people concerning worldly luxuries, even though he had the ability to attain them. If he acquired anything of worldly treasures he would spend it on this and that for the servants of Allah. He would never save anything for himself for the next day. Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÃóÎúæóİó ãóÇ ÃóÎóÇİõ Úóáóíúßõãú ãóÇ íóİúÊóÍõ Çááåõ áóßõãú ãöäú ÒóåúÑóÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ»</div><br>  (Verily, the thing I fear most for you all is what Allah will allow you to acquire of the splendor of this world. ) They (the Companions) said, "What is the splendor of this world, O Messenger of Allah'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóÑóßóÇÊõ ÇáúÃóÑúÖ»</div><br>  (The blessings of the earth.) Qatadah and As-Suddi said, "The splendor of this worldly life means the beautiful adornments of the life of this world.'' Qatadah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöäóİúÊöäóåõãú İöíåö</div><br>  (that We may test them thereby.) "So that We may put them to trial.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃúãõÑú Ãóåúáóßó ÈöÇáÕøóáæÉö æóÇÕúØóÈöÑú ÚóáóíúåóÇ</div><br>  (And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.) This means to save them from the punishment of Allah by the establishment of the prayer, and you also be patient in performing it. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ŞõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóßõãú æóÃóåúáöíßõãú äóÇÑÇğ</div><br>  (O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell).) 66:6 Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Zayd bin Aslam reported from his father that he and Yarfa' would sometimes spend the night at `Umar bin Al-Khattab's. `Umar had a certain time of night that he would get up and pray. However, sometimes he would not get up for it. Then, we would say, "He is not going to get up like he usually does.'' When he would awaken, he would make his family get up as well. He would say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃúãõÑú Ãóåúáóßó ÈöÇáÕøóáæÉö æóÇÕúØóÈöÑú ÚóáóíúåóÇ</div><br>  (And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.)'' Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó äóÓúÃóáõßó ÑöÒúŞÇğ äøóÍúäõ äóÑúÒõŞõßó</div><br>  (We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.) This means that if you establish the prayer, your sustenance will come to you from where you did not expect. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÊøóŞö Çááøóåó íóÌúÚóá áøóåõ ãóÎúÑóÌÇğæóíóÑúÒõŞúåõ ãöäú ÍóíúËõ áÇó íóÍúÊóÓöÈõ</div><br>  (And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.) 65:2-3 Allah also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÎóáóŞúÊõ ÇáúÌöäøó æóÇáÅöäÓó ÅöáÇøó áöíóÚúÈõÏõæäö </div><br>  (And I (Allah) created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).) until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó åõæó ÇáÑøóÒøóÇŞõ Ğõæ ÇáúŞõæøóÉö ÇáúãóÊöíäõ </div><br>  (Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong.) 51:56-58 Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó äóÓúÃóáõßó ÑöÒúŞÇğ äøóÍúäõ äóÑúÒõŞõßó</div><br>  (We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.) Verily, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáì: íóÇ ÇÈúäó ÂÏóãó ÊóİóÑøóÛú áöÚöÈóÇÏóÊöí ÃóãúáóÃú ÕóÏúÑóßó Ûöäìğ æóÃóÓõÏøó İóŞúÑóßó¡ æóÅöäú áóãú ÊóİúÚóáú¡ ãóáóÃúÊõ ÕóÏúÑóßó ÔõÛúáğÇ æóáóãú ÃóÓõÏøó İóŞúÑóß»</div><br>  (Allah, the Exalted, says, "O son of Adam, perform My worship and I will fill your chest with wealth and fulfill your needs. If you do not do so, then I will fill your chest with toil and I will not fulfill your needs.'') It is also reported from Zayd bin Thabit that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ßóÇäóÊö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ åóãøóåõ İóÑøóŞó Çááåõ Úóáóíúåö ÃóãúÑóåõ¡ æóÌóÚóáó İóŞúÑóåõ Èóíúäó Úóíúäóíúåö¡ æóáóãú íóÃúÊöåö ãöäó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÅöáøóÇ ãóÇ ßõÊöÈó áóåõ¡ æóãóäú ßóÇäóÊö ÇáúÂÎöÑóÉõ äöíøóÊóåõ¡ ÌóãóÚó áóåõ ÃóãúÑóåõ æóÌóÚóáó ÛöäóÇåõ İöí ŞóáúÈöåö¡ æóÃóÊóÊúåõ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóåöíó ÑóÇÛöãóÉ»</div><br>  (Whoever makes the worldly life his major concern, then Allah will scatter his situation for him (i.e. make it difficult) and his poverty will be placed between his eyes. He will not get from this world anything except that which has already been written for him. Whoever makes the Hereafter his intention, then his situation will be gathered for him (i.e. made easy) and his wealth will be placed in his heart. The worldly life will come to him anyway (in spite of his not seeking it).) Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÚóÜŞöÈóÉõ áöáÊøóŞúæóì</div><br>  (And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) This means the good end in this life and in the Hereafter. In the Hereafter the good end will be Paradise for whoever feared Allah.
