They ask you what is lawful for them. Say: "Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibat (the good things). And those Jawarih (beasts and birds of prey) which you have trained as hounds, training and teaching them (to catch) in the manner as directed to you by Allah; so eat of what they catch for you, but pronounce the Name of Allah over it, and have Taqwa of Allah. Verily, Allah is swift in reckoning.'')</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Clarifying the Lawful</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  In the previous Ayah Allah mentioned the prohibited types of food, the impure and unclean things, harmful for those who eat them, either to their bodies, religion or both, except out of necessity,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÏú İóÕøóáó áóßõã ãøóÇ ÍóÑøóãó Úóáóíúßõãú ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ÇÖúØõÑöÑúÊõãú Åöáóíúåö</div><br>  (while He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity) After that, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÃóáõæäóßó ãóÇĞóÂ ÃõÍöáøó áóåõãú Şõáú ÃõÍöáøó áóßõãõ ÇáØøóíøöÈóÜÊõ</div><br>  (They ask you what is lawful for them. Say, "Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibat...'')  In Surat Al-A`raf Allah describes Muhammad allowing the good things and prohibiting the filthy things. Muqatil said, "At-Tayyibat includes everything Muslims are allowed and the various types of legally earned provision.'' Az-Zuhri was once asked about drinking urine for medicinal purposes and he said that it is not a type of Tayyibat.'' Ibn Abi Hatim also narrated this statement. Using Jawarih to Hunt Game is Permissible Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÚóáøóãúÊõãú ãøöäó ÇáúÌóæóÇÑöÍö ãõßóáøöÈöíäó</div><br>  (And those Jawarih (beasts and birds of prey) which you have trained as hounds...) That is, lawful for you are the animals slaughtered in Allah's Name, and the good things for sustenance. The game you catch with the Jawarih are also lawful for you. This refers to trained dogs and falcons, as is the opinion of the majority of the Companions, their followers, and the Imams. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÚóáøóãúÊõãú ãøöäó ÇáúÌóæóÇÑöÍö ãõßóáøöÈöíäó</div><br>  (And those Jawarih (beasts and birds of prey) which you have trained as hounds...) refers to trained hunting dogs, falcons and all types of birds and beasts that are trained to hunt, including dogs, wild cats, falcons, and so forth. Ibn Abi Hatim collected this and said, "Similar was reported from Khaythamah, Tawus, Mujahid, Makhul and Yahya bin Abi Kathir.'' Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Umar said, "You are permitted the animal that the trained birds, such as falcons, hunt for you if you catch it (before it eats from it). Otherwise, do not eat from it.'' I say, the majority of scholars say that hunting with trained birds is just like hunting with trained dogs, because bird's of prey catch the game with their claws, just like dogs. Therefore, there is no difference between the two. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Adi bin Hatim said that he asked the Messenger of Allah about the game that the falcon hunts and the Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÃóãúÓóßó Úóáóíúßó İóßõá»</div><br>  (Whatever it catches for you, eat from it.) These carnivores that are trained to catch game are called Jawarih in Arabic, a word that is derived from Jarh, meaning, what one earns. The Arabs would say, "So-and-so has Jaraha something good for his family,'' meaning, he has earned them something good. The Arabs would say, "So-and-so does not have a Jarih for him,'' meaning, a caretaker. Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ ÌóÑóÍúÊõã ÈöÇáäøóåóÇÑö</div><br>  (And He knows what you have done during the day...) meaning, the good or evil you have earned or committed. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõßóáøöÈöíäó</div><br>  (trained as hounds,) those Jawarih that have been trained to hunt as hounds with their claws or talons. Therefore, if the game is killed by the weight of its blow, not with its claws, then we are not allowed to eat from the game. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõÚóáøöãõæäóåõäøó ãöãøóÇ Úóáøóãóßõãõ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (training them in the manner as directed to you by Allah, ) as when the beast is sent, it goes after the game, and when it catches it, it keeps it until its owner arrives and does not catch it to eat it itself. This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßõáõæÇú ãöãøóÂ ÃóãúÓóßúäó Úóáóíúßõãú æóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú ÇÓúãó Çááøóåö Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (so eat of what they catch for you, but pronounce the Name of Allah over it,) When the beast is trained, and it catches the game for its owner who mentioned Allah's Name when he sent the beast after the game, then this game is allowed according to the consensus of scholars, even if it was killed. There are Hadiths in the Sunnah that support this statement. The Two Sahihs recorded that `Adi bin Hatim said, "I said, `O Allah's Messenger! I send hunting dogs and mention Allah's Name.' He replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÑúÓóáúÊó ßóáúÈóßó ÇáúãõÚóáøóãó æóĞóßóÑúÊó ÇÓúãó Çááåö İóßõáú ãóÇ ÃóãúÓóßó Úóáóíúß»</div><br>  (If, with mentioning Allah's Name, you let loose your tamed dog after a game and it catches it, you may eat what it catches.) I said, `Even if it kills the game' He replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÅöäú ŞóÊóáúäó¡ ãóÇ áóãú íóÔúÑóßúåóÇ ßóáúÈñ áóíúÓó ãöäúåóÇ¡ İóÅöäøóßó ÅöäøóãóÇ ÓóãøóíúÊó Úóáì ßóáúÈößó æóáóãú ÊõÓóãøö Úóáì ÛóíúÑöå»</div><br>  (Even if it kills the game, unless another dog joins the hunt, for you mentioned Allah's Name when sending your dog, but not the other dog.) I said, `I also use the Mi`rad and catch game with it.' He replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÑóãóíúÊó ÈöÇáúãöÚúÑóÇÖö İóÎóÒŞó İóßõáúåõ¡ æóÅöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóåõ ÈöÚóÑúÖò İóÅöäøóåõ æóŞöíĞñ İóáóÇ ÊóÃúßõáúå»</div><br>  (If the game is hit by its sharp edge, eat it, but if it is hit by its broad side, do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death.) In another narration, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÅöĞóÇ ÃóÑúÓóáúÊó ßóáúÈóßó İóÇĞúßõÑö ÇÓúãó Çááåö¡ İóÅöäú ÃóãúÓóßó Úóáóíúßó¡ İóÃóÏúÑóßúÊóåõ ÍóíøğÇ İóÇĞúÈóÍõåõ¡ æóÅöäú ÃóÏúÑóßúÊóåõ ŞóÏú ŞóÊóáó æóáóãú íóÃúßõáú ãöäúåõ İóßõáúåõ¡ İóÅöäøó ÃóÎúĞó ÇáúßóáúÈö ĞóßóÇÊõå»</div><br>  (If you send your hunting dog, then mention Allah's Name and whatever it catches for you and you find alive, slaughter it. If you catch the game dead and the dog did not eat from it, then eat from it, for the dog has caused its slaughter to be fulfilled.) In yet another narration of two Sahihs, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÅöäú Ãóßóáó İóáóÇ ÊóÃúßõáú¡ İóÅöäøöí ÃóÎóÇİõ Ãóäú íóßõæäó ÃóãúÓóßó Úóáì äóİúÓöå»</div><br>  (If the dog eats from the game, do not eat from it for I fear that it has caught it as prey for itself.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Mention Allah's Name Upon Sending the Predators to Catch the Game</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßõáõæÇú ãöãøóÂ ÃóãúÓóßúäó Úóáóíúßõãú æóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú ÇÓúãó Çááøóåö Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (so eat of what they catch for you, but pronounce the Name of Allah over it,) meaning, upon sending it. The Prophet said to `Adi bin Hatim,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÑóÓóáúÊó ßóáúÈóßó ÇáúãõÚóáøóãó¡ æóĞóßóÑúÊó ÇÓúãó Çááåö¡ İóßõáú ãóÇ ÃóãúÓóßó Úóáóíúß»</div><br>  (When you send your trained dog and mention Allah's Name, eat from what it catches for you.) It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Abu Tha`labah related that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÑúÓóáúÊó ßóáúÈóßó İóÇĞúßõÑö ÇÓúãó Çááåö¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÑóãóíúÊó ÈöÓóåúãößó İóÇĞúßõÑö ÇÓúãó Çááå»</div><br>  (If you send your hunting dog, mention Allah's Name over it. If you shoot an arrow, mention Allah's Name over it.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú ÇÓúãó Çááøóåö Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (but pronounce the Name of Allah over it,) "When you send a beast of prey, say, `In the Name of Allah!' If you forget, then there is no harm.'' It was also reported that this Ayah commands mentioning Allah's Name upon eating. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah taught his stepson `Umar bin Abu Salamah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Óóãøö Çááåó æóßõáú Èöíóãöíäößó æóßõáú ãöãøóÇ íóáöíß»</div><br>  (Mention Allah's Name, eat with your right hand and eat from the part of the plate that is in front of you.) Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah said, "They asked, `O Allah's Messenger! Some people, - recently converted from disbelief - bring us some meats that we do not know if Allah's Name was mentioned over or not.' He replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóãøõæÇ Çááåó ÃóäúÊõãú æóßõáõæÇ»</div><br>  (Mention Allah's Name on it and eat from it.)''  </div></body></html>
