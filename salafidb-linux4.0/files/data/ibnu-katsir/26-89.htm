Ibn `Abbas said, "This is knowledge.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóáúÍöŞúäöì ÈöÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó</div><br>  (and join me with the righteous.) means, `make me one of the righteous in this world and the Hereafter.' This is like the words the Prophet said three times when he was dying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó İöí ÇáÑøóİöíŞö ÇáúÃóÚúáóì»</div><br>  (O Allah, with the Exalted Companion (of Paradise)).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÌúÚóá áøöì áöÓóÇäó ÕöÏúŞò İöì ÇáÇøñÎöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And grant me an honorable mention in later generations.) meaning, `cause me to be remembered in a good manner after my death, so that I will be spoken of and taken as a good example.' This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóßúäóÇ Úóáóíúåö İöì ÇáÇøñÎöÑöíäó ÓóáóÜãñ Úóáóì ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó ßóĞóáößó äóÌúÒöì ÇáúãõÍúÓöäöíäó </div><br>  (And We left for him (a goodly remembrance) among the later generations: "Salam (peace) be upon Ibrahim. Thus indeed do we reward the good doers.) (37:108-110)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÌúÚóáúäöì ãöä æóÑóËóÉö ÌóäøóÉö ÇáäøóÚöíãö </div><br>  (And make me one of the inheritors of the Paradise of Delight.) meaning, `bless me in this world with honorable mention after I am gone, and in the Hereafter by making me one of the inheritors of the Paradise of Delight.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÛúİöÑú áÇøğÈöì</div><br>  (And forgive my father,) This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÇ ÇÛúİöÑú áöì æóáöæóÇáöÏóìøó</div><br>  (My Lord! Forgive me, and my parents) (71:28). But this is something which Ibrahim, peace be upon him, later stopped doing, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÇÓúÊöÛúİóÇÑõ ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó áÇøğÈöíåö ÅöáÇøó Úóä ãøóæúÚöÏóÉò æóÚóÏóåóÂ ÅöíøóÇåõ</div><br>  (And Ibrahim's supplication for his father's forgiveness was only because of a promise he had made to him) (9:114) until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó áÃóæøóÇåñ Íóáöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, Ibrahim was Awwah and was forbearing) (9:114). Allah stopped Ibrahim from asking for forgiveness for his father, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ßóÇäóÊú áóßõãú ÃõÓúæóÉñ ÍóÓóäóÉñ İöì ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóÇáøóĞöíäó ãóÚóåõ</div><br>  (Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrahim and those with him), until His saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ Ãóãúáößõ áóßó ãöäó Çááøóåö ãöä ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (but I have no power to do anything for you before Allah. ) (60:4),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊõÎúÒöäöì íóæúãó íõÈúÚóËõæäó </div><br>  (And disgrace me not on the Day when they will be resurrected.) means, `protect me from shame on the Day of Resurrection and the Day when all creatures, the first and the last, will be raised.' Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãó ÑóÃóì ÃóÈóÇåõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö Úóáóíúåö ÇáúÛóÈóÑóÉõ æóÇáúŞóÊóÑóÉ»</div><br>  (Ibrahim will see his father on the Day of Resurrection, covered with dust and darkness.) According to another narration, also from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóáúŞóì ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãõ ÃóÈóÇåõ İóíóŞõæáõ: íóÇ ÑóÈøö Åöäøóßó æóÚóÏúÊóäöí Ãóäøóßó áóÇ ÊõÎúÒöíäöí íóæúãó íõÈúÚóËõæäó¡ İóíóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì: Åöäøöí ÍóÑøóãúÊõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó Úóáóì ÇáúßóÇİöÑíä»</div><br>  (Ibrahim will meet his father and will say: "O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when all creatures are resurrected.'' And Allah will say to him: "I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.'') He also recorded this in the Hadiths about the Prophets, upon them be peace, where the wording is:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóáúŞóì ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãõ ÃóÈóÇåõ ÂÒóÑó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ æóÚóáóì æóÌúåö ÂÒóÑó ŞóÊóÑóÉñ æóÛóÈóÑóÉñ¡ İóíóŞõæáõ áóåõ ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãõ: Ãóáóãú ÃóŞõáú áóßó áóÇ ÊóÚúÕöíäöí¡ İóíóŞõæáõ ÃóÈõæåõ: İóÇáúíóæúãó áóÇ ÃóÚúÕöíßó¡ İóíóŞõæáõ ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãõ: íóÇ ÑóÈøö Åöäøóßó æóÚóÏúÊóäöí Ãóäú áóÇ ÊõÎúÒöíóäöí íóæúãó íõÈúÚóËõæäó¡ İóÃóíøõ ÎöÒúíò ÃóÎúÒóì ãöäú ÃóÈöí ÇáúÃóÈúÚóÏö İóíóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì: Åöäøöí ÍóÑøóãúÊõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó Úóáóì ÇáúßóÇİöÑöíäó¡ Ëõãøó íõŞóÇáõ: íóÇ ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãõ ÇäúÙõÑú ÊóÍúÊó ÑöÌúáößó¡ İóíóäúÙõÑó¡İóÅöĞóÇ åõæó ÈöĞöíÎò ãõÊóáóØøöÎò¡ İóíõÄúÎóĞõ ÈöŞóæóÇÆöãöåö İóíõáúŞóì İöí ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (Ibrahim will meet his father Azar on the Day of Resurrection, and there will be dust and darkness on Azar's face. Ibrahim will say to him, "Did I not tell you not to disobey me'' His father will say to him: "Today I will not disobey you.'' Ibrahim will say: "O Lord, You promised me that You would not disgrace me on the Day when they are resurrected, but what disgrace can be greater than seeing my father in this state'' Allah will say to him: "I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.'' Then it will be said: "O Ibrahim! Look beneath your feet.'' So he will look and there he will see (that his father was changed into) a male hyena covered in dung, which will be caught by the legs and thrown in the Fire.) This was also recorded by Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa'i in the Tafsir of his Sunan Al-Kubra.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó áÇó íóäİóÚõ ãóÇáñ æóáÇó Èóäõæäó </div><br>  (The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail,) means, a man's wealth will not protect him from the punishment of Allah, even if he were to pay a ransom equivalent to an earthful of gold.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó Èóäõæäó</div><br>  (nor sons) means, `or if you were to pay a ransom of all the people on earth.' On that Day nothing will be of any avail except faith in Allah and sincere devotion to Him, and renunciation of Shirk and its people. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóäú ÃóÊóì Çááøóåó ÈöŞóáúÈò Óóáöíãò </div><br>  (Except him who brings to Allah a clean heart. ) meaning, free from any impurity or Shirk. Ibn Sirin said, "The clean heart knows that Allah is true, that the Hour will undoubtedly come and that Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.'' Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said, "The clean heart is the sound heart.'' This is the heart of the believer, for the heart of the disbeliever and the hypocrite is sick. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú ãøóÑóÖñ</div><br>  (In their hearts is a disease) (2:10). Abu `Uthman An-Nisaburi said, "It is the heart that is free from innovation and is content with the Sunnah.''  </div></body></html>
