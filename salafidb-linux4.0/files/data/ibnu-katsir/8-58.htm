Imam Ahmad recorded that Salim bin `Amir said, "Mu`awiyah was leading an army in Roman lands, at a time the bilateral peace treaty was valid. He wanted to go closer to their forces so that when the treaty of peace ended, he could invade them. An old man riding on his animal said, `Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Great), Allahu Akbar! Be honest and stay away from betrayal.' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóãóäú ßóÇäó Èóíúäóåõ æóÈóíúäó Şóæúãò ÚóåúÏñ İóáóÇ íóÍõáøóäøó ÚõŞúÏóÉğ æóáóÇ íóÔõÏøóåóÇ ÍóÊøóì íóäúŞóÖöí ÃóãóÏõåóÇ¡ Ãóæú íóäúÈõĞó Åöáóíúåöãú Úóáóì ÓóæóÇÁ»</div><br>  (Whoever has a treaty of peace with a people, then he should not untie any part of it or tie it harder until the treaty reaches its appointed term. Or, he should declare the treaty null and void so that they are both on equal terms.) When Mu`awiyah was informed of the Prophet's statement, he retreated. They found that man to be `Amr bin `Anbasah, may Allah be pleased with him.'' This Hadith was also collected by Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Hibban in his Sahih. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih.''  </div></body></html>
