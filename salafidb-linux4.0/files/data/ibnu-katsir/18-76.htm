It has been stated previously that this boy was playing with other boys in one of the towns, and that Al-Khidr deliberately singled him out. He was the finest and most handsome of them all, and Al-Khidr killed him. When Musa, peace be upon him, saw that he denounced him even more fervently than in the first case, and said hastily:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóŞóÊóáúÊó äóİúÓğÇ ÒóßöíøóÉğ</div><br>  (Have you killed an innocent person) meaning, a young person who had not yet committed any sin or done anything wrong, yet you killed him   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÛóíúÑö äóİúÓò</div><br>  (without Nafs) with no reason for killing him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóŞóÏú ÌöÆúÊó ÔóíúÆÇğ äøõßúÑÇğ</div><br>  (Verily, you have committed a thing Nukr!) meaning, something that is clearly evil.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó Ãóáóãú ÃóŞõáú áøóßó Åöäøóßó áóä ÊóÓúÊóØöíÚó ãóÚöìó ÕóÈúÑÇğ </div><br>  (He said: "Did I not tell you that you can have no patience with me'') Once again, Al-Khidr reiterates the condition set in the first place, so Musa says to him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÓóÃóáúÊõßó Úóä ÔóìúÁò ÈóÚúÏóåóÇ</div><br>  (If I ask you anything after this,) meaning, `if I object to anything else you do after this,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊõÕóÇÍöÈúäöì ŞóÏú ÈóáóÛúÊó ãöä áøóÏõäøöì ÚõĞúÑÇğ</div><br>  (keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me.) `you have accepted my apology twice.' Ibn Jarir narrated from Ibn `Abbas that Ubayy bin Ka`b said: "Whenever the Prophet mentioned anyone, he would pray for himself first. One day he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑóÍúãóÉõ Çááåö ÚóáóíúäóÇ æóÚóáóì ãõæÓóì áóæú áóÈöËó ãóÚó ÕóÇÍöÈöåö áóÃóÈúÕóÑó ÇáúÚóÌóÈó¡ æóáóßöäøóåõ ŞóÇáó:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÓóÃóáúÊõßó Úóä ÔóìúÁò ÈóÚúÏóåóÇ İóáÇó ÊõÕóÇÍöÈúäöì ŞóÏú ÈóáóÛúÊó ãöä áøóÏõäøöì ÚõĞúÑÇğ»</div><br>  (May the mercy of Allah be upon us and upon Musa. If he had stayed with his companion he would have seen wonders, but he said, (`If I ask you anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me.'))''  </div></body></html>
