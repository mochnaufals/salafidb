Allah encourages spending from what He has made mankind trustees of, the wealth that you - mankind - have, that He has lent you. This wealth was in the hands of those before you and was later transferred to you. Therefore, O mankind, spend as Allah commanded you from the wealth that He entrusted to you for His obedience. Otherwise, He will hold you accountable and punish you for your ignoring what He ordained on you in this regard. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöãøóÇ ÌóÚóáóßõã ãøõÓúÊóÎúáóİöíäó İöíåö</div><br>  (of that whereof He has made you trustees.), indicates that you - mankind -- will surrender this wealth to someone else. In this case, those who will inherit from you might obey Allah with their wealth, and thus acquire more happiness than you on account of what Allah has granted them. They might disobey Allah, and in this case you will have helped them commit evil and transgression.  Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir said, "I came to Allah's Messenger as he was reciting and saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáúåóÜßõãõ ÇáÊøóßøóÇËõÑõ </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõ ÇÈúäõ ÂÏóãó: ãóÇáöí ãóÇáöí¡ æóåóáú áóßó ãöä ãóÇáößó ÅöáøóÇ ãóÇÃóßóáúÊó İóÃóİúäóíúÊó¡ Ãóæú áóÈöÓúÊó İóÃóÈúáóíúÊó¡ Ãóæú ÊóÕóÏøóŞúÊó İóÃóãúÖóíúÊó¿»</div><br>  ((abundance diverts you.)( The Son of `Adam claims, "My wealth, my wealth.''

We mentioned a part of this Hadith when explaining Allah's statement in Surat Al-Baqarah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö</div><br>  (who believe in the Ghayb (unseen).)(2:3) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÏú ÃóÎóĞó ãöíËóÜŞóßõãú</div><br>  (and He has indeed taken your covenant,) is similar to another of His statements,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú äöÚúãóÉó Çááøóåö Úóáóíúßõãú æóãöíËóÜŞóåõ ÇáøóĞöì æóÇËóŞóßõã Èöåö ÅöĞú ŞõáúÊõãú ÓóãöÚúäóÇ æóÃóØóÚúäóÇ</div><br>  (And remember Allah's favor to you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said: "We hear and we obey.'')(5:7), which refers to giving the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet . Ibn Jarir said that the covenant mentioned here, is that taken from mankind, when they were still in Adam's loin. This is also the opinion of Mujahid, and Allah knows best. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöì íõäóÒøöáõ Úóáóì ÚóÈúÏöåö ÁóÇíóÜÊò ÈóíøöäóÜÊò</div><br>  (It is He Who sends down manifest Ayat to His servant) clear proofs, unequivocal evidences and plain attestations,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíõÎúÑöÌóßõãú ãøöäó ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö Åöáóì ÇáäøõæÑö</div><br>  (that He may bring you out from darkness into light.) from the darkness of ignorance, disbelief and contradictory statements to the light of guidance, certainty and faith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó Çááøóåó Èößõãú áóÑóÁõæİñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (And verily, Allah is to you full of kindness, Most Merciful.) by revealing the Divine Books and sending the Messengers to guide mankind, eradicating doubts and removing confusion. After Allah commanded mankind to first believe and spend, He again encouraged them to acquire faith and stated that He has removed all barriers between them and the acquisition of faith. Allah again encouraged them to spend,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ áóßõãú ÃóáÇøó ÊõäİöŞõæÇú İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö æóáöáøóåö ãöíÑóÇËõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of Allah And to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth.) means, spend and do not fear poverty or scarcity. Surely, He in Whose cause you spent is the King and Owner of the heavens and earth and has perfect control over their every affair, including their treasuries. He is the Owner of the Throne, with all the might that it contains, and He is the One Who said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóäİóŞúÊõãú ãøöä ÔóìúÁò İóåõæó íõÎúáöİõåõ æóåõæó ÎóíúÑõ ÇáÑøóÇÒöŞöíäó</div><br>  (And whatsoever you spend of anything, He will replace it.

They know that Allah will surely compensate them for whatever they spend. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Virtues of spending and fighting before the Conquest of Makkah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÓúÊóæöì ãöäßõã ãøóäú ÃóäİóŞó ãöä ŞóÈúáö ÇáúİóÊúÍö æóŞóÜÊóáó</div><br>  (Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquering and fought.) meaning those who did not fight and spend before the Conquest are not equal to those who spent and fought. Before Makkah was conquered, things were difficult for Muslims and only the righteous ones embraced Islam. After Makkah was conquered, Islam spread tremendously throughout the known world and people embraced the religion of Allah en masse. Similarly He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÃóÚúÙóãõ ÏóÑóÌóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóäİóŞõæÇú ãöä ÈóÚúÏõ æóŞóÜÊóáõæÇú æóßõáÇøğ æóÚóÏó Çááøóåõ ÇáúÍõÓúäóì</div><br>  (Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) The majority considers the Conquest here to be the conquest of Makkah. Ash-Sha`bi and several others said that the Ayah refers to the treaty at Al-Hudaybiyyah. There is proof for this opinion found in a Hadith from Anas, collected by Imam Ahmad. Anas said, "Khalid bin Al-Walid and `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf had a dispute. Khalid said to `Abdur-Rahman, `You boast about days (battles) that you participated in before us.' When the news of this statement reached the Prophet he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÏóÚõæÇ áöí ÃóÕúÍóÇÈöí¡ İóæóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö áóæú ÃóäúİóŞúÊõãú ãöËúáó ÃõÍõÏò Ãóæú ãöËúáó ÇáúÌöÈóÇáö ĞóåóÈğÇ¡ ãóÇ ÈóáóÛúÊõãú ÃóÚúãóÇáóåõã»</div><br>  (Do not bother my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If you spend an amount of gold equal to (Mount) Uhud, (or equal to the mountains), you will not reach the level of their actions.)'' It is a known fact that Khalid bin Al-Walid, whom the Prophet addressed this statement to, embraced Islam during the period between the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah and the conquering of Makkah. The dispute between Khalid and `Abdur-Rahman occurred because of the battle of Bani Jadhimah. The Prophet sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to them after the conquest of Makkah, and they said, "Saba'na,'' instead of saying, "Aslamna'' (we embraced Islam). So Khalid ordered their execution and the execution of their prisoners (of war); `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf and `Abdullah bin `Umar opposed him. This is the reason behind the dispute that occurred between Khalid and `Abdur-Rahman. But in the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÓõÈøõæÇ ÃóÕúÍóÇÈöí¡ İóæóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö áóæú ÃóäúİóŞó ÃóÍóÏõßõãú ãöËúáó ÃõÍõÏò ĞóåóÈğÇ¡ ãóÇ ÈóáóÛó ãõÏøó ÃóÍóÏöåöãú æóáóÇ äóÕöíİóå»</div><br>  (None should revile my Companions, for by He in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you were to spend as much gold as Uhud, it would not reach the level of them equal to an amount as much as one Mudd of one of them or half of it.) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõáÇøğ æóÚóÏó Çááøóåõ ÇáúÍõÓúäóì</div><br>  (But to all Allah has promised the best (reward).) meaning, those who spent before and after the conquest of Makkah; they all will gain a reward for their good deeds, even though some of them vary in rank and earn a better reward than others as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóÓúÊóæöì ÇáúŞóÜÚöÏõæäó ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÛóíúÑõ Ãõæúáöì ÇáÖøóÑóÑö æóÇáúãõÌóÜåöÏõæäó İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö ÈöÃóãúæóáöåöãú æóÃóäİõÓöåöãú İóÖøóáó Çááøóåõ ÇáúãõÌóÜåöÏöíäó ÈöÃóãúæóáöåöãú æóÃóäİõÓöåöãú Úóáóì ÇáúŞóÜÚöÏöíäó ÏóÑóÌóÉğ æóßõÜáÇøğ æóÚóÏó Çááøóåõ ÇáúÍõÓúäóì æóİóÖøóáó Çááøóåõ ÇáúãõÌóÜåöÏöíäó Úóáóì ÇáúŞóÜÚöÏöíäó ÃóÌúÑÇğ ÚóÙöíãÇğ </div><br>  (Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good, but Allah has preferred by a great reward those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home).)(4:95) There is a Hadith in the Sahih that states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúãõÄúãöäõ ÇáúŞóæöíøõ ÎóíúÑñ æóÃóÍóÈøõ Åöáóì Çááåö ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäö ÇáÖøóÚöíİö¡ æóİöí ßõáó ÎóíúÑ»</div><br>  (The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer; both have goodness in them.) The Prophet ended his statement this way to draw attention to the second type of believer, so that their own qualities are not forgotten in the midst of preferring the former type. In this way, the latter is not dismissed as being degraded in the Hadith. Therefore, the Prophet ended his statement by praising the second type -- the weak believers -- after giving preference to the first type. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÈöãóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó ÎóÈöíÑñ</div><br>  (And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) meaning, since Allah is perfectly aware of all things, He made distinctions between the rewards of the believers who spent and fought before the Conquest and those who spent and fought afterwards. Surely, Allah does this by His knowledge of the intention of the former type and their perfect sincerity to Him, all the while spending in times of hardship, poverty and dire straits. This is found in the Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóÈóŞó ÏöÑúåóãñ ãöÇÆóÉó Ãóáúİ»</div><br>  (Spending one Dirham is preceded over a hundred thousand.) There is no doubt that the people of faith consider Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to be the person who has the best share according to the meaning of this Ayah. He was the chief of those who implemented it, among all followers of all Prophets. He spent all of his wealth seeking the Face of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. He did it voluntarily too, not to repay a debt or a favor that anyone from mankind had on him. May Allah be pleased with him. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Encouragement to make a Handsome Loan in the Cause of Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóä ĞóÇ ÇáøóĞöì íõŞúÑöÖõ Çááøóåó ŞóÑúÖğÇ ÍóÓóäğÇ</div><br>  (Who is he that will lend Allah a handsome loan:) `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that this Ayah refers to spending in Allah's cause. It was also said that it pertains to spending on children. What is correct is that it is more general than that. So all those who spend in the cause of Allah with good intentions and a sincere heart, then they fall under the generality of this Ayah. This is why Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóä ĞóÇ ÇáøóĞöì íõŞúÑöÖõ Çááøóåó ŞóÑúÖğÇ ÍóÓóäğÇ İóíõÖóÇÚöİóåõ áóåõ</div><br>  (Who is he that will lend Allah handsome loan: then (Allah) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying),) and in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÖúÚóÇİğÇ ßóËöíÑóÉğ</div><br>  (many times) (2:245), meaning, being handsome reward and tremendous provisions: Paradise on the Day of Resurrection.

He said, `Give me your hand, O Allah's Messenger,' and the Prophet placed his hand in his hand. Abu Ad-Dahdah said, `Verily, I have given my garden as a loan to my Lord.' He had a garden that contained six hundred date trees; his wife and children were living in that garden too. Abu Ad-Dahdah went to his wife and called her, `Umm Ad-Dahdah!' She said, `Here I am.' He said, `Leave the garden, because I have given it as a loan to my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.' She said, `That is a successful trade, O Abu Ad-Dahdah!' She then transferred her goods and children.
