It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn `Abbas narrated in the Hadith about the Eclipse prayer that the Companions said, "O Allah's Messenger! While you were standing in prayer, we saw you reach for something with your hand and then you brought it back.'' The Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí ÑóÃóíúÊõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó Ãóæú ÃõÑöíÊõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó İóÊóäóÇæóáúÊõ ãöäúåóÇ ÚõäúŞõæÏğÇ¡ æóáóæú ÃóÎóĞúÊõåõ áóÃóßóáúÊõãú ãöäúåõ ãóÇ ÈóŞöíóÊö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ»</div><br>  (I saw Paradise - or was shown Paradise - and reached for a cluster (of grapes or other fruit), and had I kept it, you would have eaten from it as long as this life remains.) iImam Muslim recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÃúßõáõ Ãóåúáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóíóÔúÑóÈõæäó¡ æóáóÇ íóÊóãóÎøóØõæäó æóáóÇ íóÊóÛóæøóØõæäó¡ æóáóÇ íóÈõæáõæäó¡ ØóÚóÇãõåõãú ÌõÔóÇÁñ ßóÑöíÍö ÇáúãöÓúßö¡ æóíõáúåóãõæäó ÇáÊøóÓúÈöíÍó æóÇáÊøóŞúÏöíÓó ßóãóÇ íõáúåóãõæäó ÇáäøóİóÓ»</div><br>  (The people of Paradise eat and drink, and they do not need to blow their noses, or answer the call of nature, or urinate, for they pass the food excrements in belches, which smell like musk. They will be inspired to praise and glorify (Allah) as spontaneously as they breathe.) Imams Ahmad and An-Nasa'i recorded that Thumamah bin `Uqbah said that he heard Zayd bin Arqam say, "A man from the People of the Scriptures came and said to the Prophet , `O Abul-Qasim! You claim that the people of Paradise eat and drink' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÚóãú¡ æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓõ ãõÍóãøóÏò ÈöíóÏöåö¡ Åöäøó ÇáÑøóÌõáó ãöäúåõãú áóíõÚØóì ŞõæøóÉó ãöÇÆóÉö ÑóÌõáò İöí ÇáúÃóßúáö æóÇáÔøõÑúÈö æóÇáúÌöãóÇÚö æóÇáÔøóåúæóÉ»</div><br>  (Yes. By He in Whose Hand is Muhammad's life, a man among them will be given the strength of a hundred men in eating, drinking, sexual intercourse and appetite.) That man asked, `He who eats and drinks needs to relieve the call of nature, but Paradise is pure from feces and urine' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Êóßõæäõ ÍóÇÌóÉõ ÃóÍóÏöåöãú ÑóÔúÍğÇ íóİöíÖõ ãöäú ÌõáõæÏöåöãú ßóÑöíÍö ÇáúãöÓúßö İóíóÖúãõÑõ ÈóØúäõå»</div><br>  (One of them (residents of Paradise) relieves the call of nature through a sweat that emanates from the skin, with the scent of musk, and the stomach becomes empty again.) Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİóÜßöåóÉò ßóËöíÑóÉò - áÇøó ãóŞúØõæÚóÉò æóáÇó ãóãúäõæÚóÉò </div><br>  (And fruit in plenty, whose supply is not cut off nor are they out of reach.)56:32-33, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÏóÇäöíóÉğ Úóáóíúåöãú ÙöáóÜáõåóÇ æóĞõáøöáóÊú ŞõØõæİõåóÇ ÊóĞúáöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And the shade thereof is close upon them, and the bunches of fruit thereof will hang low within their reach.)76:14 The shade of Paradise is everlasting and never shrinks, just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö ÓóäõÏúÎöáõåõãú ÌóäøóÜÊò ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÇ ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÂ ÃóÈóÏÇğ áøóåõãú İöíåóÂ ÃóÒúæóÌñ ãøõØóåøóÑóÉñ æóäõÏúÎöáõåõãú ÙöÜáÇøğ ÙóáöíáÇğ </div><br>  (But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to Gardens under which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. Therein they shall have pure mates, and We shall admit them to shades wide and ever deepening.)4:57  Allah often mentions the description of Paradise and the description of the Fire together, to make Paradise appealing and warn against the Fire. This is why, after Allah mentioned the description of Paradise here, He next said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÚõŞúÈóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÇÊøóŞóæÇú æøóÚõŞúÈóì ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÇáäøóÇÑõ</div><br>  (this is the end (final destination) of those who have Taqwa, and the end (final destination) of the disbelievers is Fire.) Allah said in another Ayah ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÓúÊóæöì ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáäøóÇÑö æóÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö åõãõ ÇáúİóÂÆöÒõæäó </div><br>  (Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise.
