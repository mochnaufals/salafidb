This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, `Abdullah bin Al-Harith bin Nawfal, Sammak bin Harb, Qatadah, Malik bin Dinar, Ibn Jurayj and others; they all said that he was the cousin of Musa, peace be upon him. Ibn Jurayj said: "He was Qarun bin Yashar bin Qahith, and Musa was the son of `Imran bin Qahith.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóíúäóÇåõ ãöäó ÇáúßõäõæÒö</div><br>  (And We gave him of the treasures,) meaning, of wealth;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÂ Åöäøó ãóİóÇÊöÍóåõ áóÊóäõæÃõ ÈöÇáúÚõÕúÈóÉö Ãõæúáöì ÇáúŞõæøóÉö</div><br>  (that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men.)

Al-A`mash narrated from Khaythamah, "The keys of Qarun's treasure were made of leather, each key like a finger, and each key was for a separate storeroom. When he rode anywhere, the keys would be carried on sixty mules with white blazes on their foreheads and white feet.''
