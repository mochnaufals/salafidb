It is also well-known in our religion that the Messenger of Allah was sent to all mankind and the Jinns. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Ad-Darda' said, "Abu Bakr and `Umar had an argument in which Abu Bakr made `Umar angry. So `Umar went away while angry and Abu Bakr followed him asking him to forgive him, but `Umar refused. `Umar shut his door closed in Abu Bakr's face and Abu Bakr went to the Messenger of Allah while we were with him. The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãøóÇ ÕóÇÍöÈõßõãú åóĞóÇ İóŞóÏú ÛóÇãóÑ»</div><br>  (This fellow of yours (Abu Bakr) has made someone angry! `Umar became sorry for what he did, went to the Prophet and greeted him with the Salam and sat next to him, telling him what had happened. The Messenger of Allah became angry (at `Umar), and realizing that, Abu Bakr said, `O Allah's Messenger! It was me who was unjust.' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóáú ÃóäúÊõãú ÊóÇÑößõæ áöí ÕóÇÍöÈöí¿ Åöäøöí ŞõáúÊõ: íóÇ ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ Åöäøöí ÑóÓõæáõ Çááåö Åöáóíúßõãú ÌóãöíÚğÇ İóŞõáúÊõãú: ßóĞóÈúÊó æóŞóÇáó ÃóÈõæ ÈóßúÑò: ÕóÏóŞúÊ»</div><br>  (Will you leave my Companion (Abu Bakr) alone! I said, `O People! I am the Messenger of Allah to you all,' and you said, `You lie,' but Abu Bakr declared, `You said the truth.')'' Al-Bukhari recorded it. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃõÚúØöíÊõ ÎóãúÓğÇ áóãú íõÚúØóåõäøó äóÈöíøñ ŞóÈúáöí æóáóÇ ÃóŞõæáõåõ İóÎúÑğÇ ÈõÚöËúÊõ Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö ßóÇİøóÉğ ÇáúÃóÍúãóÑö æóÇáúÃóÓúæóÏö æóäõÕöÑúÊõ ÈöÇáÑøõÚúÈö ãóÓöíÑóÉó ÔóåúÑò æóÃõÍöáøóÊú áöí ÇáúÛóäóÇÆöãõ æóáóãú ÊóÍöáøó áöÃóÍóÏò ŞóÈúáöí æóÌõÚöáóÊú áöíó ÇáúÃóÑúÖõ ãóÓúÌöÏğÇ æóØóåõæÑğÇ æóÃõÚúØöíÊõ ÇáÔøóİóÇÚóÉó İóÃóÎøóÑúÊõåóÇ áöÃõãøóÊöí íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö İóåöíó áöãóäú áóÇ íõÔúÑößõ ÈöÇááåö ÔóíúÆğÇ»</div><br>  (I have been given five things which were not given to any Prophet before me, and I do not say it out of pride. I was sent to all mankind (their) black and white alike. Allah made me victorious by fright, (by His frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month's journey. The spoils of war are lawful for me, yet it was not lawful for anyone else before me. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying and a thing to perform purification with. I have been given the Shafa'ah (right of intercession), and I saved it for my Ummah on the Day of Resurrection. Therefore, the Shafa'ah will reach those who associate none with Allah in worship.) This Hadith's chain of narration is suitable, but the Two Sahihs did not record it. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì áóåõ ãõáúßõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö áÇ ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó íõÍúìö æóíõãöíÊõ</div><br>  (to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. None has the right to be worshipped but He. It is He Who gives life and causes death.) describes Allah by the words of the Messenger that He Who has sent him is the Creator, Lord and King of all things and in His Hand is the control, life, death and the decision. Just as Allah said   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÜóÇãöäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö æóÑóÓõæáöåö ÇáäøóÈöìøö ÇáÃõãøöìøö</div><br>  (So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write,) Allah proclaims here that Muhammad is His Messenger and reiterates this fact by commanding that he be believed in and followed.

Certainly, Muhammad was amply described in the previous books, including his description as being the unlettered Prophet.
