And make not Allah's (Name) an excuse in your oaths against doing good and acting piously, and making peace among mankind. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower (i.e., do not swear much and if you have sworn against doing something good then give an expiation for the oath and do good).) (225. Allah will not call you to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths, but He will call you to account for that which your hearts have earned. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Forbearing.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Prohibition of swearing to abandon a Good Deed</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah commands, `You should not implement your vows in Allah's Name to refrain from pious acts and severing the relations with the relatives, if you swear to abandon such causes.' Allah said in another Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÃúÊóáö ÃõæúáõæÇú ÇáúİóÖúáö ãöäßõãú æóÇáÓøóÚóÉö Ãóä íõÄúÊõæÇú Ãõæúáöì ÇáúŞõÑúÈóì æóÇáúãóÓóÜßöíäó æóÇáúãõåóÜÌöÑöíäó İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö æóáúíóÚúİõæÇú æóáúíóÕúİóÍõæÇú ÃóáÇó ÊõÍöÈøõæäó Ãóä íóÛúİöÑó Çááøóåõ áóßõãú</div><br>  (And let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, Al-Masakin (the poor), and those who left their homes for Allah's cause. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you) (24:22)  Continuity in a sinful vow is more sinful than breaking it by expiation. Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇááåö áóÃóäú íóáóÌøó ÃóÍóÏõßõãú Èöíóãöíäöåö İöí Ãóåúáöåö ÂËóãõ áóåõ ÚöäúÏ Çááåö ãöäú Ãóäú íõÚúØöíó ßóİøóÇÑóÊóåõ ÇáøóÊöí ÇİúÊóÑóÖó Çááåõ Úóáóíúå»</div><br>  (By Allah! It is more sinful to Allah that one of you implements his vow regarding (severing the relations with) his relatives than (breaking his promise and) paying the Kaffarah that Allah has required in such cases.)  This is how Muslim reported this Hadith and also Imam Ahmad.  `Ali bin Abu Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that what Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÌúÚóáõæÇú Çááøóåó ÚõÑúÖóÉğ áÇøğíúãóÜäößõãú</div><br>  (And make not Allah's (Name) an excuse in your oaths) means, "Do not vow to refrain from doing good works. (If you make such vow then) break it, pay the Kaffarah and do the good work.'' This was also said by Masruq, Ash-Sha`bi, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Mujahid, Tawus, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ata', `Ikrimah, Makhul, Az-Zuhri, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and As-Suddi.  Suporting this view, which is the majority view, is what is reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari narrated that Allah's Messenger said: .   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí æóÇááåö Åöäú ÔóÇÁó Çááåõ¡ áóÇ ÃóÍúáöİõ Úóáì íóãöíäò İóÃóÑóì ÛóíúÑóåóÇ ÎóíúÑğÇ ãöäúåóÇ ÅöáøóÇ ÃóÊóíúÊõ ÇáøóĞöí åõæó ÎóíúÑñ æóÊóÍóáøóáúÊõåóÇ»</div><br>  (By Allah! Allah willing, I will not vow to do a thing and then see a better act, but I would do what is better and break my vow.) Muslim reported that Abu Hurayrah said that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Íóáóİó Úóáì íóãöíäò İóÑóÃóì ÛóíúÑóåóÇ ÎóíúÑğÇ ãöäúåóÇ İóáúíõßóİøöÑú Úóäú íóãöíäöåö¡ æóáúíóİúÚóáö ÇáøóĞöí åõæó ÎóíúÑ»</div><br>  (Whoever makes a vow and then finds what is better than his vow (should break his vow,) pay the Kaffarah and perform the better deed.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Laghw (Unintentional) Vows</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íõÄóÇÎöĞõßõãõ Çááøóåõ ÈöÇáøóáÛúæö İöì ÃóíúãóÜäößõãú</div><br>  (Allah will not call you to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths,)  This Ayah means, `Allah does not punish or hold you accountable for the Laghw (unintentional) vows that you make.' The Laghw vows are unintentional and are just like the habitual statements that the tongue repeats, without really intending them. For instance, it is reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Íóáóİó İóŞóÇáó İöí Íóáöİöåö ÈöÇááøóÇÊö æóÇáúÚõÒøóì¡ İóáúíóŞõáú áóÇ Åöáóåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááå»</div><br>  (Whoever swore and (unintentionally) mentioned Al-Lat and Al-`Uzza (two idols) in his vow, should then say, `There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah'.)  The Messenger said this statement to some new Muslims whose tongues were, before Islam, used to vowing by their idol Al-Lat. Therefore, the Prophet ordered them to intentionally recite the slogan of Ikhlas, just as they mentioned these words by mistake, so that it (the word of Ikhlas) may eradicate the word (of Shirk). This is why Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöä íõÄóÇÎöĞõßõã ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈóÊú ŞõáõæÈõßõãú</div><br>  (...but He will call you to account for that which your hearts have earned.) and in another Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöãóÇ ÚóŞøóÏÊøõãõ ÇáÇøñíúãóÜäó</div><br>  (...for your deliberate oaths) (5:89)  Abu Dawud reported under Chapter: `The Laghw Vows' that `Ata' said that `A'ishah said that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇááøóÛúæõ İöí Çáúíóãöíäö åõæó ßóáóÇãõ ÇáÑøóÌõáö İöí ÈóíúÊöåö: ßóáøóÇ æóÇááåö¡ æóÈóáóì æóÇááå»</div><br>  (The Laghw in the vows includes what the man says in his house, such as, `No, by Allah,' and, `Yes, by Allah'.)  Ibn Abu Hatim reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "The Laghw vow includes vowing while angry.''  He also reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "The Laghw vow includes vowing to prohibit what Allah has allowed, and this type does not require a Kaffarah (expiation).'' Similar was said by Sa`id bin Jubayr.  In addition, Abu Dawud related under Chapter: `Vowing while Angry' that Sa`id bin Musayyib said that two Ansari brothers both received inheritance and one of them asked that the inheritance be divided. His brother said, "If you ask me about dividing the inheritance again, then all of what I have will be spent on the Ka`bah's door.'' `Umar said to him, "The Ka`bah does not need your money. So break your vow, pay the Kaffarah and come to terms with your brother. I heard Allah's Messenger saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóãöíäó Úóáóíúßó æóáóÇ äóĞúÑó İöí ãóÚúÕöíóÉö ÇáÑøóÈøö ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó¡ æóİöí ŞóØöíÚóÉö ÇáÑøóÍöãö¡ æóİöíãóÇ áóÇ Êóãúáöß»</div><br>  (Do not make a vow against yourself, nor to disobey the Lord, cut the relations of the womb or dispose of what you do not own.)''  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöä íõÄóÇÎöĞõßõã ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈóÊú ŞõáõæÈõßõãú</div><br>  (. ..but He will call you to account for that which your hearts have earned,)  Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others said that this Ayah means swearing about a matter while knowing that he is lying. Mujahid and others said this Ayah is similar to what Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöä íõÄóÇÎöĞõßõã ÈöãóÇ ÚóŞøóÏÊøõãõ ÇáÇøñíúãóÜäó</div><br>  (...but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths.) (5:89) Allah said (2:225 above):   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑñ Íóáöíãñ</div><br>  (And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Forbearing.) meaning, He is Oft-Forgiving to His servants and Most Forbearing with them.  </div></body></html>
