Al-Hamd be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of Al-Hamd</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Abu Ja`far bin Jarir said, "The meaning of   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö</div><br>  (Al-Hamdu Lillah) (all praise and thanks be to Allah) is: all thanks are due purely to Allah, alone, not any of the objects that are being worshipped instead of Him, nor any of His creation. These thanks are due to Allah's innumerable favors and bounties, that only He knows the amount of. Allah's bounties include creating the tools that help the creation worship Him, the physical bodies with which they are able to implement His commands, the sustenance that He provides them in this life, and the comfortable life He has granted them, without anything or anyone compelling Him to do so. Allah also warned His creation and alerted them about the means and methods with which they can earn eternal dwelling in the residence of everlasting happiness. All thanks and praise are due to Allah for these favors from beginning to end.''  Further, Ibn Jarir commented on the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö</div><br>  (Al-Hamdu Lillah), that it means, "A praise that Allah praised Himself with, indicating to His servants that they too should praise Him, as if Allah had said, `Say: All thanks and praise is due to Allah.' It was said that the statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö</div><br>  (All praise and thanks be to Allah), entails praising Allah by mentioning His most beautiful Names and most honorable Attributes. When one proclaims, `All thanks are due to Allah,' he will be thanking Him for His favors and bounties.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Difference between Praise and Thanks</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Hamd is more general, in that it is a statement of praise for one's characteristics, or for what he has done. Thanks are given for what was done, not merely for characteristics. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Statements of the Salaf about Al-Hamd</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Hafs mentioned that `Umar said to `Ali, "We know La ilaha illallah, Subhan Allah and Allahu Akbar. What about Al-Hamdu Lillah'' `Ali said, "A statement that Allah liked for Himself, was pleased with for Himself and He likes that it be repeated.'' Also, Ibn `Abbas said, "Al-Hamdu Lillah is the statement of appreciation. When the servant says Al-Hamdu Lillah, Allah says, `My servant has praised Me.'' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this Hadith. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Virtues of Al-Hamd</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Al-Aswad bin Sari` said, "I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Should I recite to you words of praise for My Lord, the Exalted, that I have collected' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãóÇ Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúÍóãúÏó»</div><br>  (Verily, your Lord likes Al-Hamd.)''  An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith. Furthermore, Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Musa bin Ibrahim bin Kathir related that Talhah bin Khirash said that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóİúÖóáõ ÇáĞøößúÑö áóÇ Åöáåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ¡ æóÃóİúÖóáõ ÇáÏøõÚóÇÁö ÇáúÍóãúÏõÏöááå»</div><br>  (The best Dhikr (remembering Allah) is La ilaha illallah and the best supplication is Al-Hamdu Lillah.)  At-Tirmidhi said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib. Also, Ibn Majah recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÃóäúÚóãó Çááåõ Úóáóì ÚóÈúÏòäöÚúãóÉğ İóŞóÇáó: ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááåö¡ ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇäó ÇáøóĞöí ÃóÚúØóì ÃóİúÖóáó ãöãøóÇ ÃóÎóĞó»</div><br>  (No servant is blessed by Allah and says,`Al-Hamdu Lillah', except that what he was given is better than that which he has himself acquired.) Further, in his Sunan, Ibn Majah recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÚóÈúÏğÇ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏö Çááåö ŞóÇáó:íóÇ ÑóÈøö áóßó ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ßóãóÇ íóäúÈóÛöí áöÌóáóÇáö æóÌúåößó æóÚóÙöíãö ÓõáúØóÇäößó.

Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority.' The two angels were confused as to how to write these words. They ascended to Allah and said, `O our Lord! A servant has just uttered a statement and we are unsure how to record it for him.' Allah said while having more knowledge in what His servant has said, 'What did My servant say' They said, `He said, `O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority.' Allah said to them, `Write it as My servant has said it, until he meets Me and then I shall reward him for it.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Al before Hamd encompasses all Types of Thanks and Appreciation for Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The letters Alif and Lam before the word Hamd serve to encompass all types of thanks and appreciation for Allah, the Exalted. A Hadith stated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó áóßó ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ßõáøõåõ¡ æóáóßó Çáúãõáúßõ ßõáøõåõ¡ æóÈöíóÏößó ÇáúÎóíúÑõ ßõáøõåõ¡ æóÅöáóíúßó íõÑúÌóÚõ ÇáúÃóãúÑõ ßõáøõåõ»</div><br>  (O Allah! All of Al-Hamd is due to You, You own all the ownership, all types of good are in Your Hand and all affairs belong to You.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of Ar-Rabb, the Lord</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ar-Rabb is the owner who has full authority over his property. Ar-Rabb, linguistically means, the master or the one who has the authority to lead. All of these meanings are correct for Allah. When it is alone, the word Rabb is used only for Allah. As for other than Allah, it can be used to say Rabb Ad-Dar, the master of such and such object. Further, it was reported that Ar-Rabb is Allah's Greatest Name. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of Al-`Alamin</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Al-`Alamin is plural for `Alam, which encompasses everything in existence except Allah. The word `Alam is itself a plural word, having no singular form. The `Alamin are different creations that exist in the heavens and the earth, on land and at sea. Every generation of creation is called an `Alam. Al-Farra` and Abu `Ubayd said, "`Alam includes all that has a mind, the Jinns, mankind, the angels and the devils, but not the animals.'' Also, Zayd bin Aslam and Abu Muhaysin said, `Alam includes all that Allah has created with a soul.'' Further, Qatadah said about,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (The Lord of the `Alamin), "Every type of creation is an `Alam.'' Az-Zajjaj also said, "Alam encompasses everything that Allah created, in this life and in the Hereafter.'' Al-Qurtubi commented, "This is the correct meaning, that the `Alam encompasses everything that Allah created in both worlds. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó İöÑúÚóæúäõ æóãóÇ ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó - ŞóÇáó ÑóÈøõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóãóÇ ÈóíúäóåõãóÂ Åöä ßõäÊõãú ãøõæŞöäöíäó </div><br>  (Fir`awn (Pharaoh) said: "And what is the Lord of the `Alamin'' Musa (Moses) said: "The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, if you seek to be convinced with certainty'') (26:23-24). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Why is the Creation called `Alam</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  `Alam is derived from `Alamah, that is because it is a sign testifying to the existence of its Creator and to His Oneness.''  </div></body></html>
