He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æõÌõæåñ íóæúãóÆöĞò</div><br>  (Faces that Day.) meaning, on the Day of Judgement.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äøóÇÚöãóÉñ</div><br>  (will be joyful,) meaning, pleasure will be noticeable in them (those faces). This will only occur due to their striving. Sufyan said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöÓóÚúíöåóÇ ÑóÇÖöíóÉñ </div><br>  (Glad with their endeavor.) "They will be pleased with their deeds.'' Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÌóäøóÉò ÚóÇáöíóÉò </div><br>  (In a lofty Paradise.) meaning, elevated and brilliant, secure in their dwellings.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó ÊóÓúãóÚõ İöíåóÇ áóÜÛöíóÉğ </div><br>  (Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.) meaning, they will not hear in the Paradise that they will be in, any foolish word. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóÓúãóÚõæäó İöíåóÇ áóÛúæÇğ ÅöáÇøó ÓóáóÜãÇğ</div><br>  (They shall not hear therein any Laghw, but only Salam.) (19:62) Allah also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó áóÛúæñ İöíåóÇ æóáÇó ÊóÃúËöíãñ</div><br>  (Free from any Laghw, and free from sin.) (52:23) and He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÓúãóÚõæäó İöíåóÇ áóÛúæÇğ æóáÇó ÊóÃúËöíãÇğ - ÅöáÇøó ŞöíáÇğ ÓóáóÜãÇğ ÓóáóÜãÇğ </div><br>  (No Laghw will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: "Salam! Salam!'' ) (56:25-26) Then Allah continues,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåóÇ Úóíúäñ ÌóÇÑöíóÉñ </div><br>  (Therein will be a running spring.) meaning, flowing freely. This is mentioned with the intent of emphasizing affirmation. It is not intended to mean that there is only one spring. So here it refers to springs collectively. Thus, the meaning is that in it (Paradise) are flowing springs. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúåóÇÑõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÊóİóÌøóÑõ ãöäú ÊóÍúÊö ÊöáóÇáö Ãóæú ãöäú ÊóÍúÊö ÌöÈóÇáö ÇáúãöÓúß»</div><br>  (The rivers of Paradise spring forth from beneath hills -- or mountains -- of musk.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåóÇ ÓõÑõÑñ ãøóÑúİõæÚóÉñ </div><br>  (Therein will be thrones raised high.) meaning, lofty, delightful, numerous couches, with elevated ceilings. Upon which will be seated wide-eyed, beautiful maidens. They have mentioned that whenever the friend of Allah wishes to sit on these lofty thrones, they (the thrones) will lower themselves for him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóßúæóÇÈñ ãøóæúÖõæÚóÉñ </div><br>  (And cups set at hand.) meaning, drinking containers that are prepared and presented for whoever among their masters (i.e., the people of Paradise) wants them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóãóÇÑöŞõ ãóÕúİõæİóÉñ </div><br>  (And Namariq set in rows.) Ibn `Abbas said, "An-Namariq are pillows.'' This was also said by `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri and others. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÒóÑóÇÈöíøõ ãóÈúËõæËóÉñ </div><br>  (And Zarabi, spread out (Mabthuthah).) Ibn `Abbas said, "Az-Zarabi are carpets.'' This was also said by Ad-Dahhak and others. Here the word Mabthuthah means placed here and there for whoever would like to sit upon them.  </div></body></html>
