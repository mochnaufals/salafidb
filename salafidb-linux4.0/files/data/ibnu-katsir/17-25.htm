Shu`bah narrated from Yahya bin Sa`id from Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib; "This refers to those who commit sin then repent, and commit sin then repent.''  `Ata' bin Yasar, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Mujahid said: "They are the ones who return to goodness.'' Mujahid narrated from `Ubayd bin `Umayr, concerning this Ayah: "This is the one who, when he remembers his sin when he is alone, he seeks the forgiveness of Allah.'' Mujahid agreed with him on that. Ibn Jarir said: "The best view on this matter is of those who said that it refers to the one who repents after committing sin, who comes back from disobedience to obedience and who leaves that which Allah hates for that which He loves and is pleased with. '' What he said is correct, for Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÅöáóíúäóÂ ÅöíóÇÈóåõãú </div><br>  (Verily, to Us will be their return) (88:25). And according to a Sahih Hadith, the Messenger of Allah would say when he returned from a journey,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÂíöÈõæäó ÊóÇÆöÈõæäó¡ ÚóÇÈöÏõæäó áöÑóÈøöäóÇ ÍóÇãöÏõæä»</div><br>  (We have returned repenting, worshipping and praising our Lord.)  </div></body></html>
