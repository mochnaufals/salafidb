Say to My servants who have believed, that they should perform the Salah, and spend (in charity) out of the sustenance We have given them, secretly and openly, before the coming of a Day on which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command for Prayer and Charity</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah orders His servants to obey Him, fulfill His rights and be kind to His creatures. He ordained the prayer, which affirms the worship of Allah alone, without partners, and to spend from the provisions that He has granted them, by paying the due Zakah, spending on relatives and being kind to all others. Establishing the prayer requires performing it on time, perfectly, preserving its act of bowing having humility during it, and preserving its prostrations. Allah has ordained spending from what He granted, in secret and public, so that the people save themselves,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä íóÃúÊöìó íóæúãñ</div><br>  (before the coming of a Day), the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó ÈóíúÚñ İöíåö æóáÇó ÎöáóÜáñ</div><br>  (on which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.) on which no ransom will be accepted from anyone, if he seeks to buy himself. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇáúíóæúãó áÇó íõÄúÎóĞõ ãöäßõãú İöÏúíóÉñ æóáÇó ãöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you, nor of those who disbelieved.) 57:15 Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÎöáóÜáñ</div><br>  (nor befriending.) Ibn Jarir commented, "Allah says that on that Day, there will be no friendship between friends that might save those deserving punishment from it. Rather, on that Day, there will be fairness and justice.''  Qatadah said, "Allah knows that in this life, there is mutual bargaining and there are friendships which people benefit from. A man chooses his friends and the reasons behind befriending them; if it was for Allah's sake, their friendship should be maintained, but if it was for other than Allah, their friendship is bound to be cutoff.'' I say that the meaning of this, is that Allah the Exalted is declaring that on that Day, no mutual bargaining or ransom will avail anyone, even if he ransoms himself with the earth's fill of gold if he could find that amount! No friendship or intercession shall avail one if he meets Allah while a disbeliever. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú íóæúãğÇ áÇøó ÊóÌúÒöì äóİúÓñ Úóä äøóİúÓò ÔóíúÆğÇ æóáÇó íõŞúÈóáõ ãöäúåóÇ ÚóÏúáñ æóáÇó ÊóäİóÚõåóÇ ÔóİóÜÚóÉñ æóáÇó åõãú íõäÕóÑõæäó </div><br>  (And fear the Day when no person shall avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use to him, nor shall they be helped.)2:123 and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÃóäİöŞõæÇú ãöãøóÇ ÑóÒóŞúäóÜßõã ãøöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä íóÃúÊöìó íóæúãñ áÇøó ÈóíúÚñ İöíåö æóáÇó ÎõáøóÉñ æóáÇó ÔóİóÜÚóÉñ æóÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó åõãõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãõæäó </div><br>  (O you believe!
