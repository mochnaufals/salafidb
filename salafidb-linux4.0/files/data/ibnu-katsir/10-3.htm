He tells us that He created the heavens and the earth in six days. It was said: "Like these days (meaning our worldly days).'' It was also said: "Every day is like a thousand years of what we reckon.'' Later, this will be discussed further.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÇÓúÊóæóì Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÑúÔö</div><br>  (and then rose over (Istawa) the Throne.)'' The Throne is the greatest of the creatures and is like a ceiling for them. Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÏóÈøöÑõ ÇáÇøñãúÑó</div><br>  (arranging the affair of all things.) means that He controls the affairs of the creatures.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÚúÒõÈõ Úóäúåõ ãöËúŞóÇáõ ĞóÑøóÉò İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóáÇó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Not even the weight of a speck of dust escapes His Knowledge in the heavens or in the earth.) (34:3) No affair distract' Him from other affairs. No matter troubles Him. The persistent requests of His creatures do not annoy Him. He governs big things as He governs small things everywhere, on the mountains, in the oceans, in populated areas, or in wastelands.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ãöä ÏóÂÈøóÉò İöí ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöáÇøó Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÑöÒúŞõåóÇ</div><br>  (And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah.)

There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.) (6:59) Ad-Darawardi narrated from Sa`d bin Ishaq bin Ka`b bin `Ujrah that he said: "When this Ayah was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßõãõ Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó</div><br>  (Surely, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth) they met a great caravan whom they thought should be Arabs. They said to them: `Who are you' They replied: `We are Jinns. We left Al-Madinah because of this Ayah.''' This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ãöä ÔóİöíÚò ÅöáÇøó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ÅöĞúäöåö</div><br>  (No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after He permits.) This is similar to what is in the following Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä ĞóÇ ÇáøóĞöì íóÔúİóÚõ ÚöäÏóåõ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÅöĞúäöåö</div><br>  (Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission) (2:255) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóãú ãøöä ãøóáóßò İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö áÇó ÊõÛúäöì ÔóİóÜÚóÊõåõãú ÔóíúÆÇğ ÅöáÇøó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö Ãóä íóÃúĞóäó Çááøóåõ áöãóä íóÔóÂÁõ æóíóÑúÖóì </div><br>  (And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with.)(53:26), and;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóäİóÚõ ÇáÔøóİóÜÚóÉõ ÚöäÏóåõ ÅöáÇøó áöãóäú ÃóĞöäó áóåõ</div><br>  (Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits. )(34:23).  Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößõãõ Çááøóåõ ÑóÈøõßõãú İóÇÚúÈõÏõæåõ ÃóİóáÇó ÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (That is Allah, your Lord; so worship Him (alone).

Say: "Will you not then have Taqwa'') (23:86-87), Similar is mentioned in the Ayah before this Ayah and after it.  </div></body></html>
