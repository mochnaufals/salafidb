Verily, I am Allah.'')28:30 However, here Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì ÃóäóÇú ÑóÈøõßó</div><br>  (Verily, I am your Lord!) meaning, `the One Who is talking to you and addressing you,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÎúáóÚú äóÚúáóíúßó</div><br>  (So take off your shoes;) `Ali bin Abi Talib, Abu Dharr, Abu Ayyub and others of the Salaf said, "They (his sandals) were from the skin of a donkey that was not slaughtered.'' It has also been said that he was only commanded to remove his sandals due to respect for the blessed spot. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Øõæğì</div><br>  (Tuwa) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said, "It is the name of the valley.'' Others have said the same. This is merely mentioned as something to give more explanation to the story. It has also been said that it is a figure of speech, which comes from the command to place his feet down. It has also been said that it means `doubly sacred' and that Tuwa is something that has repetitious blessings. However, the first opinion is most correct. It is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú äóÇÏóÇåõ ÑóÈøõåõ ÈöÇáúæóÇÏö ÇáúãõŞóÏøóÓö Øõæğì </div><br>  (When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa.) 79:16 Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäóÇ ÇÎúÊóÑúÊõßó</div><br>  (And I have chosen you.) is similar to His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäúì ÇÕúØóİóíúÊõßó Úóáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö ÈöÑöÓóÜáóÜÊöí æóÈößóáóÜãöí</div><br>  (I have chosen you above men by My Messages, and by My speaking (to you).) 7:144 This means over all human beings of that time. It has also been said that Allah said, "O Musa, do you know why I chose to speak to you directly out of all of the people'' Musa said, "No.'' Allah then said, "Because I have not made anyone humble himself as much as you have humbled yourself. '' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÓúÊóãöÚú áöãóÇ íõæÍóì</div><br>  (So listen to that which will be revealed.) "Now listen to what I say to you and what I reveal to you.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóäöì ÃóäóÇ Çááøóåõ áÇ ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇ ÃóäóÇú</div><br>  (Verily, I am Allah!

Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúÈõÏúäöì</div><br>  (so worship Me,) This means, "Single Me out alone for worship, and establish My worship without associating anything with Me.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóŞöãö ÇáÕøóáóæÉó áöĞößúÑöì</div><br>  (and perform Salah for My remembrance.) It has been said that this means, "Pray in order to remember Me.'' It has also been said that it means, "And establish the prayer whenever you remember Me.'' There is a supporting evidence for this second statement in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÑóŞóÏó ÃóÍóÏõßõãú Úóäö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö Ãóæú Ûóİóáó ÚóäúåóÇ¡ İóáúíõÕóáøöåóÇ ÅöĞóÇ ĞóßóÑóåóÇ¡ İóÅöäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáì ŞóÇáó:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóŞöãö ÇáÕøóáóæÉó áöĞößúÑöì</div><br>  (Whenever one of you sleeps past the prayer, or he forgets to pray, then let him pray when he remembers it. For verily, Allah said, (And perform Salah for My remembrance.)) In the Two Sahihs it is reported from Anas that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú äóÇãó Úóäú ÕóáóÇÉò Ãóæú äóÓöíóåóÇ İóßóİøóÇÑóÊõåóÇ Ãóäú íõÕóáøöíóåóÇ ÅöĞóÇ ĞóßóÑóåóÇ¡ áóÇ ßóİøóÇÑóÉóÉóáåóÇ ÅöáøóÇ Ğóáöß»</div><br>  (Whoever slept past the prayer, or forgot it, then his expiation is that he prays it when he remembers it. There is no expiation for it other than that.) Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉó ÁóÇÊöíóÉñ</div><br>  (Verily, the Hour is coming) This means that it is established and there is no avoiding it. It will be and it is inevitable. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóßóÇÏõ ÃõÎúİöíåóÇ</div><br>  (I am almost hiding it) Ad-Dahhak related from Ibn `Abbas that he used to recite it as, "I almost kept it hidden -- from myself.'' Ibn `Abbas then would say, "Because nothing is ever hidden from Allah's Self.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóßóÇÏõ ÃõÎúİöíåóÇ</div><br>  (I am almost hiding it.) "This means that no one knows its appointed time except Me (Allah).''

It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden.) 7:187 This means that its knowledge weighs heavily upon the dwellers of the heavens and the earth.

This means, "Do not follow the way of the person who does not believe in the Hour (Day of Judgement) and he only pursues his desires in this worldly life. He disobeys his Lord and only follows his desires. Whoever behaves like these people, then verily he has failed and lost.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóÑúÏóì</div><br>  (lest you perish.)
