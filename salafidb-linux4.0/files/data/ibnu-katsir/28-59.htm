And never would We destroy the towns unless the people thereof are wrongdoers.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Destruction of Towns, which are not destroyed until Evidence is established against Them</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Referring to the people of Makkah, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóãú ÃóåúáóßúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÑúíóÉò ÈóØöÑóÊú ãóÚöíÔóÊóåóÇ</div><br>  (And how many a town have We destroyed, which was thankless for its means of livelihood!) They were arrogant transgressors who denied Allah's blessing of giving them ample provision. This is like the Ayah, o   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÖóÑóÈó Çááøóåõ ãóËóáÇğ ŞóÑúíóÉğ ßóÇäóÊú ÁóÇãöäóÉğ ãøõØúãóÆöäøóÉğ íóÃúÊöíåóÇ ÑöÒúŞõåóÇ ÑóÛóÏğÇ ãøöä ßõáøö ãóßóÇäò</div><br>  (And Allah puts forward the example of a township, that dwelt secure and well-content: its provision coming to it in abundance from every place) until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÎóĞóåõãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ æóåõãú ÙóÜáöãõæäó</div><br>  (So the torment overtook them while they were wrongdoers.) (16:112-113) Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊöáúßó ãóÓóÜßöäõåõãú áóãú ÊõÓúßóä ãøöä ÈóÚúÏöåöãú ÅöáÇøó ŞóáöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And those are their dwellings, which have not been inhabited after them except a little.) Their land became empty and desolate, and you can see nothing but their dwellings.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõäøóÇ äóÍúäõ ÇáúæóÑöËöíäó</div><br>  (And verily, We have been the heirs.) Their towns became ruins, with none remaining.  Then Allah tells us of His justice and that He does not destroy anyone unjustly; on the contrary, He destroys those whom He destroys after establishing proof against them. So, he says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÑóÈøõßó ãõåúáößó ÇáúŞõÑóì ÍóÊøóì íóÈúÚóËó İöì ÃõãøöåóÇ</div><br>  (And never will your Lord destroy the towns until He sends to their mother town) i.e., Makkah --   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÓõæáÇğ íóÊúáõæ Úóáóíúåöãú ÁóÇíóÜÊöäóÇ</div><br>  (a Messenger reciting to them Our Ayat.) This indicates that the Unlettered Prophet, Muhammad was sent from the Mother of Cities as a Messenger to all cities and towns, Arab and non-Arab alike. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöÊõäĞöÑó Ãõãøó ÇáúŞõÑóì æóãóäú ÍóæúáóåóÇ</div><br>  (so that you may warn the Mother of Towns and all those around it) (6:92).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íóÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ Åöäøöì ÑóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö Åöáóíúßõãú ÌóãöíÚğÇ</div><br>  (Say: "O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.'') (7:158),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøñäĞöÑóßõãú Èöåö æóãóä ÈóáóÛó</div><br>  (That I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.) (6:19)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóßúİõÑú Èöåö ãöäó ÇáÇøñÍúÒóÇÈö İóÇáäøóÇÑõ ãóæúÚöÏõåõ</div><br>  (but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place.) (11:17).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ãøöä ŞóÑúíóÉò ÅöáÇøó äóÍúäõ ãõåúáößõæåóÇ ŞóÈúáó íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö Ãóæú ãõÚóĞøöÈõæåóÇ ÚóĞóÇÈğÇ ÔóÏöíÏğÇ</div><br>  (And there is not a town but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with a severe torment.) (17:58). Allah tells us that He will destroy every town before the Day of Resurrection, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßõäøóÇ ãõÚóĞøöÈöíäó ÍóÊøóì äóÈúÚóËó ÑóÓõæáÇğ</div><br>  (And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger.) (17:15). Allah has sent the Unlettered Prophet to all the towns (all of mankind), because he has been sent to the Mother of Cities, their source to which they all return. It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈõÚöËúÊõ Åöáóì ÇáúÃóÍúãóÑö æóÇáúÃóÓúæóÏ»</div><br>  (I have been sent to the red and the black.) Prophethood ended with him, and there is no Prophet or Messenger to come after him, but his way will remain as long as night and day remain, until the Day of Resurrection.  </div></body></html>
