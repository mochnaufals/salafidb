So he gathered up his family and the flocks which his father-in-law had given to him, and set out on a cold, dark, rainy night. They stopped to camp, and whenever he tried to start a fire, he did not succeed. He was surprised by this, and while he was in this state,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÁóÇäóÓó ãöä ÌóÇäöÈö ÇáØøõæÑö äóÇÑÇğ</div><br>  (he saw a fire in the direction of At-Tur) he saw a fire burning from a far.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóÇáó áÇøğåúáöåö ÇãúßõËõæÇú Åöäøöì ÁóÇäóÓúÊõ äóÇÑÇğ</div><br>  (He said to his family: "Wait, I have seen a fire...'') meaning, `wait while I go there, '   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóÚóáøöì ÁóÇÊöíßõãú ãøöäúåóÇ ÈöÎóÈóÑò</div><br>  (perhaps I may bring to you from there some information,) This was because they lost their way.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÌóĞúæóÉò ãøöäó ÇáäøóÇÑö áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÕúØóáõæäó</div><br>  (or a burning firebrand that you may warm yourselves.) so that they could get warm and find relief from the cold.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÂ ÃóÊóÜåóÇ äõæÏöìó ãöä ÔóÇØöìÁö ÇáúæóÇÏöì ÇáÃóíúãóäö</div><br>  (So when he reached it (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley,) From the side of the valley that adjoined the mountain on his right, to the west. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßõäÊó ÈöÌóÇäöÈö ÇáúÛóÑúÈöìøö ÅöĞú ŞóÖóíúäóÂ Åöáóì ãõæÓóì ÇáÇøñãúÑó</div><br>  (And you were not on the western side, when We made clear to Musa the commandment) (20:44). This indicates that when Musa headed for the fire, he headed in the direction of the Qiblah with the western mountain on his right. He found the fire burning in a green bush on the side of the mountain adjoining the valley, and he stood there amazed at what he was seeing. Then his Lord called him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ÔóÇØöìÁö ÇáúæóÇÏöì ÇáÃóíúãóäö İöì ÇáúÈõŞúÚóÉö ÇáúãõÈóÇÑóßóÉö ãöäó ÇáÔøóÌóÑóÉö</div><br>  (from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä íãõæÓóì Åöäøöì ÃóäóÇ Çááøóåõ ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (O Musa! Verily, I am Allah, the Lord of all that exits!) meaning, `the One Who is addressing you and speaking to you is the Lord of all that exits, the One Who does what He wills, the One apart from Whom there is no other god or lord, may He be exalted and sanctified, the One Who by His very nature, attributes, words and deeds is far above any resemblance to His creation, may He be glorified.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäú ÃóáúŞö ÚóÕóÇßó</div><br>  (And throw your stick!) `the stick that is in your hand' -- as was stated in the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ Êöáúßó Èöíóãöíäößó íãõæÓóì - ŞóÇáó åöìó ÚóÕóÇìó ÃóÊóæóßøóÄõÇ ÚóáóíúåóÇ æóÃóåõÔøõ ÈöåóÇ Úóáóì Ûóäóãöì æóáöìó İöíåóÇ ãóÃóÑöÈõ ÃõÎúÑóì </div><br>  ("And what is that in your right hand, O Musa'' He said: "This is my stick, whereon I lean, and wherewith I beat down branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses.'') (20:17-18). The meaning is: `this stick, which you know so well;'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÃóáúŞöåóÇ íãõæÓóì - İóÃóáúŞóÜåóÇ İóÅöĞóÇ åöìó ÍóíøóÉñ ÊóÓúÚóì </div><br>  ("Cast it down, O Musa!'' He cast it down, and behold! It was a snake, moving quickly.) (20:19-20). Musa knew that the One Who was speaking to him was the One Who merely says to a thing, "Be!'' and it is, as we have already stated in (the explanation of) Surah Ta Ha. And here Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÁóÇåóÇ ÊóåúÊóÒøõ ßóÃóäøóåóÇ ÌóÂäøñ æóáøóì ãõÏúÈöÑÇğ</div><br>  (But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight,) It moved so quickly, even though it was so big, and its mouth was so huge, with its jaws snapping. It swallowed every rock it passed, and every rock that fell into its mouth fell with a sound like a rock falling into a valley. When he saw that:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáøóì ãõÏúÈöÑÇğ æóáóãú íõÚóŞøöÈú</div><br>  (he turned in flight, and looked not back.) he did not turn around, because it is human nature to flee from such a thing. But when Allah said to him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íãõæÓóì ÃóŞúÈöáú æóáÇó ÊóÎóİú Åöäøóßó ãöäó ÇáÇøñãöäöíäó</div><br>  (O Musa! Draw near, and fear not. Verily, you are of those who are secure.) he came back to his original position. Then Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÓúáõßú íóÏóßó İöì ÌóíúÈößó ÊóÎúÑõÌú ÈóíúÖóÂÁó ãöäú ÛóíúÑö ÓõæÁò</div><br>  (Put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without a disease;) meaning, `when you put your hand in your garment and then draw it out, it will be shining white as if it were a piece of the moon or a flash of lightning.' Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöäú ÛóíúÑö ÓõæÁò</div><br>  (without a disease) i.e., with no trace of leukoderma.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÖúãõãú Åöáóíúßó ÌóäóÇÍóßó ãöäó ÇáÑøóåúÈö</div><br>  (and draw your hand close to your side to be free from the fear.) Mujahid said, "To be free from terror.'' Qatadah said, "To be free from fear.'' Musa was commanded, when he felt afraid of anything, to draw his hand close to his side to be free from the fear. If he did that, whatever fear he felt would be gone. Perhaps if a person does this, following the example of Musa, and puts his hand over his heart, his fear will disappear or be lessened, if Allah wills; in Allah we place our trust.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞóÇäößó ÈõÑúåóÇäóÜäö ãöä ÑøóÈøößó</div><br>  (These are two proofs from your Lord) This refers to the throwing down of his stick, whereupon it turned into a moving snake, and his putting his hand into his garment and bringing it forth white without a disease. These were two clear and definitive proofs of the power of the One Who does as He chooses, and of the truth of the prophethood of the one at whose hands these miracles occurred. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöáóì İöÑúÚóæúäó æóãóáÅöíúåö</div><br>  (to Fir`awn and his chiefs.) meaning his leaders and prominent followers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõãú ßóÇäõæÇú ŞóæúãÇğ İóÜÓöŞöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, they are the people who are rebellious.) means, who are disobedient towards Allah and who go against His commands and His religion.  </div></body></html>
