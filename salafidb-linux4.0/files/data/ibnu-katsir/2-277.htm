Because of their Riba, Allah will torment them in this life and punish them for it on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõá áÇøó íóÓúÊóæöì ÇáúÎóÈöíËõ æóÇáØøóíøöÈõ æóáóæú ÃóÚúÌóÈóßó ßóËúÑóÉõ ÇáúÎóÈöíËö</div><br>  (Say: "Not equal are Al-Khabith (evil things) and At-Tayyib (good things), even though the abundance of Al-Khabith may please you'') 5:100   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÌúÚóáó ÇáúÎóÈöíËó ÈóÚúÖóåõ Úóáóì ÈóÚúÖò İóíóÑúßõãóåõ ÌóãöíÚÇğ İóíóÌúÚóáóåõ İöì Ìóåóäøóãó</div><br>  (And put the wicked (disbelievers and doers of evil deeds) one over another, heap them together and cast them into Hell) 8:37, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÁóÇÊóíúÊõãú ãøöä ÑøöÈÇğ áøöíóÑúÈõæóÇú İöì ÃóãúæóÇáö ÇáäøóÇÓö İóáÇó íóÑúÈõæÇú ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And that which you give in gift (to others), in order that it may increase (your wealth by expecting to get a better one in return) from other people's property, has no increase with Allah) 30:39.  Ibn Jarir said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóãúÍóŞõ Çááøóåõ ÇáúÑøöÈóæÇú</div><br>  (Allah will destroy Riba) is similar to the statement reported of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, "Riba will end up with less, even if it was substantial.'' Imam Ahmad recorded a similar statement in Al-Musnad. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah Increases Charity, Just as One Raises His Animal</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÑúÈöì ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÜÊö</div><br>  (And will give increase for Sadaqat) means, Allah makes charity grow, or He increases it. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÊóÕóÏøóŞó ÈöÚóÏúáö ÊóãúÑóÉò ãöäú ßóÓúÈò ØóíøöÈò¡ æóáóÇ íóŞúÈóáõ Çááåõ ÅöáøóÇ ÇáØøóíøöÈó¡ İóÅöäøó Çááåó íóÊóŞóÈøóáõåóÇ Èöíóãöíäöåö¡ Ëõãøó íõÑóÈøöíåóÇ áöÕóÇÍöÈöåö¡ ßóãóÇ íõÑóÈøöí ÃóÍóÏõßõãú İóáõæøóåõ ÍóÊøóì Êóßõæäó ãöËúáó ÇáúÌóÈóá»</div><br>  (Whoever gives in charity what equals a date from honest resources, and Allah only accepts that which is good and pure, then Allah accepts it with His right (Hand) and raises it for its giver, just as one of you raises his animal, until it becomes as big as a mountain.)  This was recorded in the book of Zakah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah Does not Like the Disbelieving Sinners</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ áÇó íõÍöÈøõ ßõáøó ßóİøóÇÑò ÃóËöíãò</div><br>  (And Allah likes not the disbelievers, sinners) indicates that Allah does not like he who has a disbelieving heart, who is a sinner in tongue and action. There is a connection between the beginning of the Ayah on Riba and what Allah ended it with. Those who consume Riba are not satisfied with the permissible and pure resources that Allah provided them. Instead, they try to illegally acquire people's money by relying on evil methods. This demonstrates their lack of appreciation for the bounty that Allah provides. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Praising Those Who Thank Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah praised those who believe in His Lordship, obey His commands, thank Him and appreciate Him. They are those who are kind to His creation, establish prayer and give charity due on their money. Allah informed them of the honor that He has prepared for them and that they will be safe from the repercussions of the Day of Resurrection.
