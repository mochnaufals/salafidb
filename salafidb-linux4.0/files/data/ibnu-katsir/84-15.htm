This will occur on the Day of Judgement.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍõŞøóÊú</div><br>  (and it must do so.) meaning, it is right for it to obey the command of its Lord, because it is great and cannot be rejected, nor overcome. Rather it overpowers everything and everything is submissive to it. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ãõÏøóÊú </div><br>  (And when the earth is stretched forth,) meaning, when the earth is expanded, spread out and extended. Then He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóáúŞóÊú ãóÇ İöíåóÇ æóÊóÎóáøóÊú </div><br>  (And has cast out all that was in it and became empty.) meaning, it throws out the dead inside of it, and it empties itself of them. This was said by Mujahid, Sa`id, and Qatadah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóĞöäóÊú áöÑóÈøöåóÇ æóÍõŞøóÊú </div><br>  (And listens to and obeys its Lord, and it must do so.) The explanation of this is the same as what has preceded. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Recompense for Deeds is True</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ Åöäøóßó ßóÇÏöÍñ Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó ßóÏúÍÇğ</div><br>  (O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions, a sure returning,) meaning, `verily you are hastening to your Lord and working deeds.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãõáóÜŞöíåö</div><br>  (and you will meet.) `Then you will meet that which you did of good or evil.' A proof for this is what Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded from Jabir, that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÇáó ÌöÈúÑöíáõ: íóÇ ãõÍóãøóÏõ¡ ÚöÔú ãóÇ ÔöÆúÊó İóÅöäøóßó ãóíøöÊñ¡ æóÃóÍúÈöÈú (ãóäú) ÔöÆúÊó İóÅöäøóßó ãõİóÇÑöŞõåõ¡ æóÇÚúãóáú ãóÇ ÔöÆúÊó İóÅöäøóßó ãõáóÇŞöíå»</div><br>  (Jibril said, "O Muhammad! Live how you wish, for verily you will die; love what you wish, for verily you will part with it; and do what you wish, for verily you will meet it (your deed).) There are some people who refer the pronoun back to the statement "your Lord.'' Thus, they hold the Ayah to mean, "and you will meet your Lord.'' This means that He will reward you for your work, and pay you for your efforts. Therefore, both of these two views are connected. Al-`Awfi recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said explaining,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ Åöäøóßó ßóÇÏöÍñ Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó ßóÏúÍÇğ</div><br>  (O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions, a sure returning,) "Whatever deed you do, you will meet Allah with it, whether it is good or bad.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Presentation and the Discussion that will take place during the Reckoning</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóãøóÇ ãóäú ÃõæÊöìó ßöÊóÜÈóåõ Èöíóãöíäöåö - İóÓóæúİó íõÍóÇÓóÈõ ÍöÓóÇÈÇğ íóÓöíÑÇğ  </div><br>  (Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand, he surely,  will receive an easy reckoning,) (84:7-8) meaning, easy without any difficulty.  This means that he will not be investigated for all the minute details of his  deeds. For verily, whoever is reckoned like that, he will certainly be destroyed.   Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah  said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú äõæŞöÔó ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈó ÚõĞøöÈ»</div><br>  (Whoever is interrogated during the reckoning, then he will be punished.) `A'ishah  then said, "But didn't Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó íõÍóÇÓóÈõ ÍöÓóÇÈÇğ íóÓöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (He surely will receive an easy reckoning,)'' The Prophet replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóíúÓó ĞóÇßö ÈöÇáúÍöÓóÇÈö¡ æóáóÜÜßöäú Ğáößö ÇáúÚóÑúÖõ¡ ãóäú äõæŞöÔó ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈó  íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÚõĞøöÈ»</div><br>  (That is not during to the Reckoning, rather it is referring to the presentation.  Whoever is interrogated during the Reckoning on the Day of Judgement, then he  will be punished.) This Hadith has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari,  Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Jarir. In reference to  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóäŞóáöÈõ Åöáóì Ãóåúáöåö ãóÓúÑõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (And will return to his family Masrur!) This means that he will return  to his family in Paradise. This was said by Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak.  They also said, "Masrur means happy and delighted by what Allah has  given him.'' Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ãóäú ÃõæÊöìó ßöÊóÜÈóåõ æóÑóÂÁó ÙóåúÑöåö </div><br>  (But whosoever is given his Record behind his back,) meaning, he will be given  his Book in his left hand, behind his back, while his hand is bent behind him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó íóÏúÚõæ ËõÈõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (He will invoke destruction,) meaning, loss and destruction.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÕúáóì ÓóÚöíÑÇğ - Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó İöì Ãóåúáöåö ãóÓúÑõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (And he shall enter a blazing Fire, and made to taste its burning. Verily, he  was among his people in joy!) meaning, happy. He did not think about the consequences,  nor feared what (future) was in front of him. His light happiness will be followed  by long grief.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ Ùóäøó Ãóä áøóä íóÍõæÑó </div><br>  (Verily, he thought that he would never return!) meaning, he used to believe  that he would not return to Allah, nor would Allah bring him back  (to life) after his death. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and  others. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáóì Åöäøó ÑóÈøóåõ ßóÇäó Èöåö ÈóÕöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!) meaning, certainly  Allah will repeat his creation just as he began his creation, and He will  reward him based upon his deeds, whether they were good or bad. He was ever  watchful of him, meaning All-Knowing and All-Aware.  </div></body></html>
