His judgement or ruling takes precedence over their own choices for themselves, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó æóÑóÈøößó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÍóÊøóì íõÍóßøöãõæßó İöíãóÇ ÔóÌóÑó Èóíúäóåõãú Ëõãøó áÇó íóÌöÏõæÇú İöì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú ÍóÑóÌÇğ ãøöãøóÇ ŞóÖóíúÊó æóíõÓóáøöãõæÇú ÊóÓúáöíãÇğ </div><br>  (But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept with full submission.)

It was also reported in the Sahih that `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, you are dearer to me than everything except myself.''

He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÂäó íóÇÚõãóÑ»</div><br>  (Now, O `Umar you have got it right.)

This was recorded only by Al-Bukhari, and he also recorded it in the Book of Loans.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÒúæóÌõåõ ÃõãøóåóÜÊõåõãú</div><br>  (and his wives are their mothers.) means, they are unlawful for marriage. In terms of honor, respect and veneration, it is not permissible for them to be alone with them, and the prohibition of marriage to them does not extend to their daughters and sisters, according to scholarly consensus.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõæúáõæ ÇáÇøñÑúÍóÇãö ÈóÚúÖõåõãú Ãóæúáóì ÈöÈóÚúÖò İöì ßöÊóÜÈö Çááøóåö ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó æóÇáúãõåóÜÌöÑöíäó</div><br>  (And blood relations among each other have closer personal ties in the decree of Allah than the believers and the Muhajirin, ) This is an abrogation of the rule that existed previously, whereby they could inherit from one another by virtue of the oath of brotherhood among them. Ibn `Abbas and others said: "A Muhajir would inherit from an Ansari even though they were not related by blood, because of the brotherhood established between them by the Messenger of Allah .'' This was also stated by Sa`id bin Jubayr and others among scholars of the earlier and later generations.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Ãóä ÊóİúÚóáõæÇú Åöáóì ÃóæúáöíóÂÆößõãú ãøóÚúÑõæİÇğ</div><br>  (except that you do kindness to those brothers.) means, the idea of inheriting from one another has gone, but there remains the duty to offer support and kindness, to uphold ties of brotherhood and to offer good advice.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇäó Ğáöß İöì ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö ãóÓúØõæÑğÇ</div><br>  (This has been written in the Book.) This ruling, which is that those who are blood relatives have closer personal ties to one another, is a ruling which Allah has decreed and which is written in the First Book which cannot be altered or changed. This is the view of Mujahid and others. (This is the case) even though Allah legislated something different at certain times, and there is wisdom behind this, for He knew that this would be abrogated and the original ruling that was instituted an eternity ago would prevail, and this is His universal and legislative decree. And Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
