The meaning of the word Tatfif here is to be stingy with measurement and weight, either by increasing it if it is due from the others, or decreasing it if it is a debt.

Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith from Malik and `Abdullah bin `Awn, both of whom reported it from Nafi`. Muslim also recorded it from two routes.  Another Hadith: Imam Ahmad recorded from Al-Miqdad, who was Ibn Al-Aswad Al-Kindi, that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ßóÇäó íóæúãõ ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÃõÏúäöíóÊö ÇáÔøóãúÓõ ãöäó ÇáúÚöÈóÇÏö ÍóÊúì Êóßõæäó ŞóÏúÑó ãöíáò Ãóæú ãöíáóíúäö ŞÇá İóÊóÕúåóÑõåõãõ ÇáÔøóãúÓõ İóíóßõæäõæäó İöí ÇáúÚóÑóŞö ßóŞóÏúÑö ÃóÚúãóÇáöåöãú¡ ãöäúåõãú ãóäú íóÃúÎõĞõåõ Åöáóì ÚóŞöÈóíúåö¡ æóãöäúåõãú ãóäú íóÃúÎõĞõåõ Åöáóì ÑõßúÈóÊóíúåö¡ æóãöäúåõãú ãóäú íóÃúÎõĞõåõ Åöáóì ÍóŞúæóíúåö¡ æóãöäúåõãú ãóäú íõáúÌöãõåõ ÅöáúÌóÇãğÇ»</div><br>  (On the Day of Judgement, the sun will draw near the servants until it is a mile or two away from them. Then the sun will burn them, and they will be submersed in sweat based upon the amount of their deeds. From among them there will be those whose sweat will come up to their two heels. From among them there will be those whose sweat will come up to their two knees. From among them there will be those whose sweat will come up to their groins. From among them there will be those who will be bridled in sweat (up to their necks).) This Hadith was recorded by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi. In Sunan Abu Dawud it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah used to seek refuge with Allah from the hardship of standing on the Day of Judgement. It has been reported from Ibn Mas`ud that they will be standing for forty years with their heads raised toward the sky. No one will speak to them, and the righteous and wicked among them will all be bridled in sweat. It has been reported from Ibn `Umar that they will be standing for one hundred years. Both of these statements have been recorded by Ibn Jarir. In the Sunans of Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah, it is recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah used to begin his late night prayer by declaring Allah's greatness ten times, praising Allah ten times, glorifying Allah ten times, and seeking Allah's forgiveness ten times. Then he would say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó ÇÛúİöÑú áöí æóÇåúÏöäöí æóÇÑúÒõŞúäöí æóÚóÇİöäöí»</div><br>  (O Allah! Forgive me, guide me, provide for me, and protect me.) Then he would seek refuge from the hardship of the standing on the Day of Judgement.  </div></body></html>
