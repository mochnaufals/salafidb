For this reason most of the reciters recited this Ayah with Qawlul-Haqq (statement of truth) as the subject, referring to `Isa himself. `Asim and `Abdullah bin `Amir both recited it Qawlal-Haqq (statement of truth) referring to the story in its entirety that the people differed about. It is reported from Ibn Mas`ud that he recited it as Qalal-Haqqa, which means that he (`Isa) said the truth. The recitation of the Ayah with the Qawlul-Haqq being the subject referring to `Isa, is the most apparent meaning grammatically. It has support for it in the statement of Allah after the story of `Isa,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóŞøõ ãöä ÑøóÈøößó İóáÇó Êóßõäú ãøöä ÇáúãõãúÊóÑöíäó </div><br>  ((This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) 3:60 When Allah mentioned that He created him as a servant and a Prophet, He extolled Himself, the Most Holy, by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ßóÇäó ááøóåö Ãóä íóÊøóÎöĞó ãöä æóáóÏò ÓõÈúÍóÜäóåõ</div><br>  (It befits not (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glorified be He.) Means glory be unto Him, He is far exalted above that which these ignorant, wrongdoing, transgressing people say about Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ŞóÖóì ÃóãúÑğÇ İóÅöäøóãóÇ íóŞõæáõ áóåõ ßõä İóíóßõæäõ</div><br>  (When He decrees a thing, He only says to it: "Be!'' -- and it is.) Whenever He wants something, He merely commands it and it happens as He wills. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ãóËóáó ÚöíÓóì ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö ßóãóËóáö ÁóÇÏóãó ÎóáóŞóåõ ãöä ÊõÑóÇÈò Ëõãøó ŞóÇáó áóåõ ßõä İóíóßõæäõ - ÇáúÍóŞøõ ãöä ÑøóÈøößó İóáÇó Êóßõäú ãøöä ÇáúãõãúÊóÑöíäó </div><br>  (Verily, the likeness of `Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then said to him: "Be'' -- and he was. (This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.) 3:59-60 <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>`Isa commanded the Worship of Allah Alone, then the People differed after Him</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó Çááøóåó ÑóÈøöì æóÑóÈøõßõãú İóÇÚúÈõÏõæåõ åóÜĞóÇ ÕöÑóØñ ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãñ </div><br>  (And verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. That is the straight path.) Among those things which `Isa said to his people while he was in his cradle is that Allah was his Lord and their Lord, and he commanded them to worship Him alone. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúÈõÏõæåõ åóÜĞóÇ ÕöÑóØñ ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãñ</div><br>  (So worship Him. That is the straight path.) Meaning, "That which I have come to you with from Allah is the straight path.'' This means that the path is correct; whoever follows it will be rightly guided and whoever opposes it will deviate and go astray. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÎúÊóáóİó ÇáÇøñÍúÒóÇÈõ ãöä Èóíúäöåöãú</div><br>  (Then the sects differed,) means that the opinions of the People of the Book differed concerning `Isa even after the explanation of his affair and the clarification of his situation. They disagreed about his being the servant of Allah, His Messenger, and His Word that He cast upon Maryam and a spirit from Himself. So a group of them -- who were the majority of the Jews (may Allah's curses be upon them) -- determined that he was a child of fornication and that his speaking in his cradle was merely sorcery. Another group said that it was Allah Who was speaking (not `Isa). Others said that he (`Isa) was the son of Allah. Some said that he was the third part of a divine trinity with Allah. Yet, others said that he was the servant of Allah and His Messenger. This latter view is the statement of truth, which Allah guided the believers to. A report similar with this meaning has been reported from `Amr bin Maymun, Ibn Jurayj, Qatadah and others from the Salaf (predecessors) and the Khalaf (later generations). Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóæúíúáñ áøöáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ãöä ãøóÔúåöÏö íóæúãò ÚóÙöíãò</div><br>  (so woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.) This is a threat and severe warning for those who lie about Allah, invent falsehood and claim that He (Allah) has a son. However, Allah has given them respite until the Day of Resurrection, and He has delayed their term out of gentleness and confident reliance upon His divine decree overcoming them. Verily, Allah does not hasten the affair of those who disobey Him. This has been related in a Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó áóíõãúáöí áöáÙøóÇáöãö ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÎóĞóåõ áóãú íõİúáöÊúå»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah gives respite to the wrongdoer until He seizes him and he will not be able to escape Him.) Then, the Messenger of Allah recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞáößó ÃóÎúĞõ ÑóÈøößó ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÎóĞó ÇáúŞõÑóì æóåöìó ÙóÜáöãóÉñ Åöäøó ÃóÎúĞóåõ Ãóáöíãñ ÔóÏöíÏñ </div><br>  (Such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful, (and) severe.) 11:102 In the Two Sahihs it is also reported that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÃóÍóÏó ÃóÕúÈóÑõ Úóáóì ÃóĞìğ ÓóãöÚóåõ ãöäó Çááåö¡ Åöäøóåõãú íóÌúÚóáõæäó áóåõ æóáóÏğÇ æóåõæó íóÑúÒõŞõåõãú æóíõÚóÇİöíåöã»</div><br>  (No one is more patient with something harmful that he hears than Allah. Verily, they attribute to Him a son, while He is the One Who provides them sustenance and good health.) Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÃóíøöä ãøöä ŞóÑúíóÉò ÃóãúáóíúÊõ áóåóÇ æóåöìó ÙóÜáöãóÉñ Ëõãøó ÃóÎóĞúÊõåóÇ æóÅöáóìøó ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ </div><br>  (And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing. Then I punished it. And to me is the (final) return (of all).) 22:48 Allah, the Exalted, also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÍúÓóÈóäøó Çááøóåó ÛóÜİöáÇğ ÚóãøóÇ íóÚúãóáõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãõæäó ÅöäøóãóÇ íõÄóÎøöÑõåõãú áöíóæúãò ÊóÔúÎóÕõ İöíåö ÇáÃóÈúÕóÜÑõ </div><br>  (Consider not that Allah is unaware of that which the wrongdoers do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.)14:42 This is the reason that Allah says here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóæúíúáñ áøöáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ãöä ãøóÔúåöÏö íóæúãò ÚóÙöíãò</div><br>  (So woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.) referring to the Day of Resurrection. It has been related in an authentic Hadith that is agreed upon (in Al-Bukhari and Muslim), on the authority of `Ubadah bin As-Samit who said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÔóåöÏó Ãóäú áóÇ Åöáóåó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ æóÍúÏóåõ áóÇ ÔóÑöíßó áóåõ¡ æóÃóäøó ãõÍóãøóÏğÇ ÚóÈúÏõåõ æóÑóÓõæáõåõ¡ æóÃóäøó ÚöíÓóì ÚóÈúÏõÇááåö æóÑóÓõæáõåõ æóßóáöãóÊõåõ ÃóáúŞóÇåóÇ Åöáóì ãóÑúíóãó æóÑõæÍñ ãöäúåõ¡ æóÃóäøó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ÍóŞøñ æóÇáäøóÇÑó ÍóŞøñ¡ ÃóÏúÎóáóåõ Çááåõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó Úóáóì ãóÇ ßóÇäó ãöäó ÇáúÚóãóá»</div><br>  (Whoever testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone, Who has no partners, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and that `Isa was Allah's servant and Messenger, and His Word that He cast upon Maryam, and a spirit from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are both real, then Allah will admit him into Paradise regardless of whatever he did.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÓúãöÚú Èöåöãú æóÃóÈúÕöÑú íóæúãó íóÃúÊõæäóäóÇ áóÜßöäö ÇáÙøóÜáöãõæäó Çáúíóæúãó İöì ÖóáóÜáò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  </div></body></html>
