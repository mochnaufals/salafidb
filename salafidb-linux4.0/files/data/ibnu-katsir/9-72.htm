The people said, "O Allah's Messenger! Shall we acquaint the people with this good news'' He said, (Paradise has one-hundred grades which Allah has prepared for the Mujahidin who fight in His cause, the distance between each two grades is like the distance between the heaven and the earth. So, when you ask Allah, ask Him for Al-Firdaws which is the best and highest part of Paradise, from it gush forth the rivers of Paradise and above it is the `Arsh (Throne) of the Beneficent.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÕóáøóíúÊõãú Úóáóíøó İóÓóáõæÇ Çááåó áöíó ÇáúæóÓöíáóÉ»</div><br>  Şíá íÇ ÑÓæá Çááå æãÇ ÇáæÓíáÉ¿ŞÇá:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÚúáóì ÏóÑóÌóÉò İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö áóÇ íóäóÇáõåóÇ ÅöáøóÇ ÑóÌõáñ æóÇÍöÏñ æóÃóÑúÌõæ Ãóäú Ãóßõæäó ÃóäóÇ åõæ»</div><br>  (If you invoke Allah for Salah (blessings) on me, then also invoke Him to grant me Al-Wasilah.) He was asked, "What is Al-Wasilah, O Allah's Messenger'' He said, (The highest grade in Paradise, it will be for only one man, and I hope I am that man.) The Musnad contains a Hadith from Sa`d bin Mujahid At-Ta'i, that Abu Al-Mudillah said, that Abu Hurayrah said, "We said, `O Allah's Messenger!

He will ask them, `Are you pleased' They will say, `Why would not we be pleased, O Lord, while You have given us what You have not given any other of your creation' He will say, `Should I give you what is better than all this' They will say, `O Lord!
