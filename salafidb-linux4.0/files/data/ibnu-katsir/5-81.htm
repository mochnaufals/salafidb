Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawud and `Isa, son of Maryam.

Evil indeed is that which they have sent forward before themselves; for that (reason) Allah is wrath with them, and in torment they will abide.) (81.

He cursed them because they disobeyed Allah and transgressed against His creatures. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "They were cursed in the Tawrah, the Injil, the Zabur (Psalms) and the Furqan (Qur'an).'' Allah then states that during their time, their habit was that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇäõæÇú áÇó íóÊóäóÜåóæúäó Úóä ãøõäßóÑò İóÚóáõæåõ</div><br>  (They used not to forbid one another from the evil they committed.) They did not forbid each other from committing sins and the prohibitions. Allah chastised them for this behavior, so that their behavior would not be imitated. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÈöÆúÓó ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóİúÚóáõæäó</div><br>  (Vile indeed was what they used to do.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Hadiths that Order Enjoining Righteousness and Forbidding Evil</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  There are many Hadiths that order enjoining righteousness and forbidding evil. Imam Ahmad recorded that Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö¡ áóÊóÃúãõÑõäøó ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö¡ æóáóÊóäúåóæõäøó Úóäö ÇáúãõäúßóÑö¡ Ãóæú áóíõæÔößóäøó Çááåõ Ãóäú íóÈúÚóËó Úóáóíúßõãú ÚöŞóÇÈğÇ ãöäú ÚöäúÏöåö¡ Ëõãøó áóÊóÏúÚõäøóåõ İóáóÇ íóÓúÊóÌöíÈó áóßõã»</div><br>  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will enjoin righteousness and forbid evil, or Allah will send a punishment on you from Him. Then, you will supplicate to Him, but He will not accept your supplication.) At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said, "This Hadith is Hasan.'' Muslim recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÑóÃóì ãöäúßõãú ãõäúßóÑğÇ İóáúíõÛóíøöÑúåõ ÈöíóÏöåö¡ İóÅöäú áóãú íóÓúÊóØöÚú İóÈöáöÓóÇäöåö¡ İóÅöäú áóãú íóÓúÊóØöÚú İóÈöŞóáúÈöåö¡ æóĞáößó ÃóÖúÚóİõ ÇáúÅöíãóÇä»</div><br>  (He among you who witnesses an evil, let him change it with his hand, if he cannot do that, then by his tongue, if he cannot do even that, then with his heart, and this is the weakest faith.) Abu Dawud said that Al-`Urs, meaning Ibn `Amirah, said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÚõãöáóÊö ÇáúÎóØöíÆóÉõ İöí ÇáúÃóÑúÖö ßóÇäó ãóäú ÔóåöÏóåóÇ İóßóÑöåóåóÇ¡ æóŞóÇáó ãóÑøóÉğ İóÃóäúßóÑóåóÇ ßóÇäó ßóãóäú ÛóÇÈó ÚóäúåóÇ¡ æóãóäú ÛóÇÈó ÚóäúåóÇ İóÑóÖöíóåóÇ ßóÇäó ßóãóäú ÔóåöÏóåóÇ»</div><br>  (When sin is committed on the earth, then whoever witnesses it and hates - (once he said): forbids it, will be like those who did not witness it. Whoever was absent from it, but agreed with it, will be like those who witness it.) Only Abu Dawud recorded this Hadith. Abu Dawud recorded that one of the Companions said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóäú íóåúáößó ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÍóÊøóì íóÚúĞöÑõæÇ Ãóæú íõÚúĞöÑõæÇ ãöäú ÃóäúİõÓöåöã»</div><br>  (The people will not perish until they do not leave -or- have any excuse for themselves.) Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah gave a speech once and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ áóÇ íóãúäóÚóäøó ÑóÌõáğÇ åóíúÈóÉõ ÇáäøóÇÓö Ãóäú íóŞõæáó ÇáúÍóŞøó ÅöĞóÇ Úóáöãóå»</div><br>  (Behold! Fear from people should not prevent one from saying the truth if he knows it.) Abu Sa`id then cried and said, "By Allah! We have seen some errors, but we feared (the people).'' Another Hadith that Abu Sa`id narrated states that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóİúÖóáõ ÇáúÌöåóÇÏö ßóáöãóÉõ ÍóŞó ÚöäúÏó ÓõáúØóÇäò ÌóÇÆöÑ»</div><br>  (The best Jihad is a word of truth proclaimed before an unjust ruler.)  Recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Gharib from this route of narration.'' Imam Ahmad recorded that Hudhayfah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóäúÈóÛöí áöãõÓúáöãò Ãóäú íõĞöáøó äóİúÓóå»</div><br>  (It is not required of the Muslim that he humiliate himself.) They said, `How does one humiliate himself'' he said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÊóÚóÑøóÖõ ãöäó ÇáúÈóáóÇÁö áöãóÇ áóÇ íõØöíŞ»</div><br>  (He takes on trials that he is not capable of enduring. ) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, and At-Tirmidhi said, "This Hadith is Hasan Sahih Gharib.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Censuring the Hypocrites</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÑóì ßóËöíÑÇğ ãøöäúåõãú íóÊóæóáøóæúäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (You see many of them taking the disbelievers as their friends.) Mujahid said that this Ayah refers to the hypocrites. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÈöÆúÓó ãóÇ ŞóÏøóãóÊú áóåõãú ÃóäİõÓõåõãú</div><br>  (Evil indeed is that which they have sent forward before themselves;) by giving their loyalty and support to the disbelievers, instead of the believers. This evil act caused them to have hypocrisy in their hearts and brought them the anger of Allah, that will remain with them until the Day of Return. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä ÓóÎöØó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (for that (reason) Allah is wrath with them) because of what they did.
