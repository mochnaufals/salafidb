You we worship, and You we ask for help.) (1:5)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Linguistic and Religious Meaning of `Ibadah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Linguistically, `Ibadah means subdued. For instance, a road is described as Mu`abbadah, meaning, `paved'. In religious terminology, `Ibadah implies the utmost love, humility and fear. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Merit of stating the Object of the Action before the Doer of the Act,  and the Merit of these Negations</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  "You...'', means, we worship You alone and none else, and rely on You alone  and none else. This is the perfect form of obedience and the entire religion  is implied by these two ideas. Some of the Salaf said, Al-Fatihah is the  secret of the Qur'an, while these words are the secret of Al-Fatihah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöíøóÇßó äóÚúÈõÏõ æóÅöíøóÇßó äóÓúÊóÚöíäõ </div><br>  (5. You we worship, and You we ask for help from.)  The first part is a declaration of innocence from Shirk (polytheism), while  the second negates having any power or strength, displaying the recognition  that all affairs are controlled by Allah alone. This meaning is reiterated  in various instances in the Qur'an. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúÈõÏúåõ æóÊóæóßøóáú Úóáóíúåö æóãóÇ ÑóÈøõßó ÈöÛóÜİöáò ÚóãøóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (So worship Him (O Muhammad ) and put your trust in Him.

(11:123),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Èöåö æóÚóáóíúåö ÊóæóßøóáúäóÇ</div><br>  (Say: "He is the Most Gracious (Allah), in Him we believe, and in Him  we put our trust.'') (67:29),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøóÈøõ ÇáúãóÔúÑöŞö æóÇáúãóÛúÑöÈö áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó İóÇÊøóÎöĞúåõ æóßöíáÇğ  </div><br>  ((He alone is) the Lord of the east and the west; La ilaha illa  Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He).  So take Him alone as Wakil (Disposer of your affairs)), (73:9), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöíøóÇßó äóÚúÈõÏõ æóÅöíøóÇßó äóÓúÊóÚöíäõ </div><br>  (You we worship, and You we ask for help from).  We should mention that in this Ayah, the type of speech here changes from  the third person to direct speech by using the Kaf in the statement Iyyaka  (You). This is because after the servant praised and thanked Allah, he  stands before Him, addressing Him directly;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöíøóÇßó äóÚúÈõÏõ æóÅöíøóÇßó äóÓúÊóÚöíäõ </div><br>  (You we worship, and You we ask for help from).  So take Him alone as Wakil (Disposer of your affairs)), (73:9), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöíøóÇßó äóÚúÈõÏõ æóÅöíøóÇßó äóÓúÊóÚöíäõ </div><br>  (You we worship, and You we ask for help from).

It is required  in every Prayer.</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The beginning of Surat Al-Fatihah contains Allah's praise for Himself by His most beautiful Attributes and indicates to His servants that, they too, should praise Him in the same manner. Hence, the prayer is not valid unless one recites Al-Fatihah, if he is able. The Two Sahihs recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÕóáóÇÉó áöãóäú áóãú íóŞúÑóÃú ÈöİóÇÊöÍóÉö ÇáúßöÊóÇÈö»</div><br>  (There is no valid prayer for whoever does not recite Al-Fatihah of the Book.)  Also, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááøóåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì : ŞóÓóãúÊõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó Èóíúäöí æóÈóíúäó ÚóÈúÏöí äöÕúİóíúäö¡ İóäöÕúİõåóÇ áöí æóäöÕúİõåóÇ áöÚóÈúÏöí æóáöÚóÈúÏöí ãóÇ ÓóÃóáó¡ ÅöĞóÇ ŞóÇáó ÇáúÚóÈúÏõ:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö ÑóÈø ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó íóæúãö Åöäøó Çááøóåõ íõÄúãöäõæäó ßóİóÑõæÇú Çááøóåõ íõÄúãöäõæäó ÛöÔóÜæóÉñ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÛúÖõæÈö íõäİöŞõæäó Çááøóåõ ÓóæóÂÁ ŞõáõæÈöåöãú íõÄúãöäõæäó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöãú ŞõáõæÈöåöãú ÊõäĞöÑúåõãú íõæŞöäõæäó Çááøóåõ ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö ÓóãúÚöåöãú íõÄúãöäõæäó ŞõáõæÈöåöãú ÊõäĞöÑúåõãú íóæúãö Ãóãú Çááøóåõ áøáúãõÊøóŞöíäó ŞõáõæÈöåöãú ÈöãóÂ Çááøóåõ íõÄúãöäõæäó Åöäøó Çááøóåõ íõÄúãöäõæäó ßóİóÑõæÇú Çááøóåõ ÇáúãóÛúÖõæÈö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö»</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>¡ ŞóÇáó Çááåõ: ÃóËúäì Úóáóíøó ÚóÈúÏöí İóÅĞóÇ ŞóÇáó:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÜáößö íóæúãö ÇáÏøöíäö ¡ ŞóÇáó Çááåõ: ãóÌøóÏóäöí ÚóÈúÏöí¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ŞóÇáó:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöíøóÇßó äóÚúÈõÏõ æóÅöíøóÇßó äóÓúÊóÚöíäõ ¡ ŞóÇáó: åĞóÇ Èóíúäöí æóÈóíúäó ÚóÈúÏöí¡ æóáöÚóÈúÏöí ãóÇ ÓóÃóáó¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ŞóÇáó:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇåúÏöäóÇ ÇáÕøöÑóÇØó ÇáúãõÓúÊóŞöíãó </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÕöÑóÇØó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóäúÚóãúÊó Úóáóíúåöãú ÛóíúÑö ÇáúãóÛúÖõæÈö Úóáóíúåöãú æóáÇó ÇáÖøóÂáøöíäó ¡ ŞóÇáó: åĞóÇ áöÚóÈúÏöí¡ æóáöÚóÈúÏöí ãóÇ ÓóÃóáó»</div><br>  (Allah said, `I divided the prayer into two halves between Myself and My servant, one half is for Me and one half for My servant.

Further, Qatadah said that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöíøóÇßó äóÚúÈõÏõ æóÅöíøóÇßó äóÓúÊóÚöíäõ </div><br>  (You we worship, and You we ask for help from) "Contains Allah's command to us to perform sincere worship for Him and to seek His aid concerning all of our affairs.'' Allah mentioned,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöíøóÇßó äóÚúÈõÏõ</div><br>  (You we worship) before,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöíøóÇßó äóÓúÊóÚöíäõ</div><br>  (And You we ask for help from), because the objective here is the worship, while Allah's help is the tool to implement this objective. Certainly, one first takes care of the most important aspects and then what is less important, and Allah knows best. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah called His Prophet Õáì Çááå Úáíå æÓáã an `Abd</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah called His Messenger an `Abd (servant) when He mentioned sending down His Book, the Prophet's involvement in inviting to Him, and when mentioning the Isra' (overnight journey from Makkah to Jerusalem and then to heaven), and these are the Prophet's most honorable missions. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóãúÏõ áöáøóåö ÇáøóĞöì ÃóäúÒóáó Úóáóì ÚóÈúÏöåö ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (All praise and thanks be to Allah, Who has sent down to His servant (Muhammad ) the Book (the Qur'an)) (18:1),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóåõ áøóãóÇ ŞóÇãó ÚóÈúÏõ Çááøóåö íóÏúÚõæåõ</div><br>  (And when the servant of Allah (Muhammad ) stood up invoking Him (his Lord Ü Allah in prayer)), (72:19) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓõÈúÍóÇäó ÇáøóĞöì ÃóÓúÑóì ÈöÚóÈúÏöåö áóíúáÇğ</div><br>  (Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) (above all that they associate with Him) Who took His servant (Muhammad ) for a journey by night) (17:1). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Encouraging the Performance of the Acts of Worship during Times of Distress</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah also recommended that His Prophet resort to acts of worship during times when he felt distressed because of the disbelievers who defied and denied him. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú äóÚúáóãõ Ãóäøóßó íóÖöíŞõ ÕóÏúÑõßó ÈöãóÇ íóŞõæáõæäó - İóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÍóãúÏö ÑóÈøößó æóßõäú ãøöäó ÇáÓøóÜÌöÏöíäó - æóÇÚúÈõÏú ÑóÈøóßó ÍóÊøóì íóÃúÊöíóßó ÇáúíóŞöíäõ </div><br>  (Indeed, We know that your breast is straitened at what they say. So glorify the praises of your Lord and be of those who prostrate themselves (to Him). And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death)) (15:97-99). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Why Praise was mentioned First</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Since the praise of Allah, Who is being sought for help, was mentioned, it was appropriate that one follows the praise by asking for his need. We stated that Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóäöÕúİõåóÇ áöí æóäöÕúİõåóÇ áöÚóÈúÏöí¡ æóáöÚóÈúÏöí ãóÇ ÓóÃóáó»</div><br>  (One half for Myself and one half for My servant, and My servant shall have what he asked.)  This is the best method for seeking help, by first praising the one whom help is sought from and then asking for His aid, and help for one's self, and for his Muslim brethren by saying.  </div></body></html>
