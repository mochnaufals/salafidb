The angels of heaven will come down on that Day and surround all creatures at the place of gathering, then the Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, will come to pass judgement. Mujahid said, "This is as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú íóäÙõÑõæäó ÅöáÇøó Ãóä íóÃúÊöíóåõãõ Çááøóåõ İöí Ùõáóáò ãøöäó ÇáúÛóãóÇãö æóÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ</div><br>  (Do they then wait for anything other than that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds and the angels)'' (2:210)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çáúãõáúßõ íóæúãóÆöĞò ÇáúÍóŞøõ áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö</div><br>  (The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty) of the Most Gracious,)  This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöãóäö Çáúãõáúßõ Çáúíóæúãó áöáøóåö ÇáúæóÍöÏö ÇáúŞóåøóÇÑö</div><br>  (Whose is the kingdom this Day: It is Allah's, the One, the Irresistable!)

This is how the disbelievers will be on the Day of Resurrection. As for the believers, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÍúÒõäõåõãõ ÇáúİóÒóÚõ ÇáÇøñßúÈóÑõ</div><br>  (The greatest terror will not grieve them.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóæúãó íóÚóÖøõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãõ Úóáóì íóÏóíúåö íóŞõæáõ íáóíúÊóäöì ÇÊøóÎóĞúÊõ ãóÚó ÇáÑøóÓõæáö ÓóÈöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And (remember) the Day when the wrongdoer will bite at his hands, he will say: "O! Would that I had taken a path with the Messenger.'') Here Allah tells us of the regret felt by the wrongdoer who rejected the path of the Messenger and what he brought from Allah of clear truth concerning which there is no doubt, and followed another path. When the Day of Resurrection comes, he will feel regret but his regret will avail him nothing, and he will bite on his hands in sorrow and grief. Whether this Ayah was revealed concerning `Uqbah bin Abi Mu`it or someone else among the doomed, it applies to every wrongdoer, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊõŞóáøóÈõ æõÌõæåõåõãú İöì ÇáäøóÇÑö</div><br>  (On the Day when their faces will be turned over in the Fire) as mentioned in those two Ayat 33:66 Every wrongdoer will feel the ultimate regret on the Day of Resurrection, and will bite at his hands, saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóæúãó íóÚóÖøõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãõ Úóáóì íóÏóíúåö íóŞõæáõ íáóíúÊóäöì ÇÊøóÎóĞúÊõ ãóÚó ÇáÑøóÓõæáö ÓóÈöíáÇğ - íæóíúáóÊóÇ áóíúÊóäöì áóãú ÃóÊøóÎöĞú İõáÇóäÇğ ÎóáöíáÇğ </div><br>  (O! Would that I had taken a path with the Messenger. Ah! Woe to me! Would that I had never taken so-and-so as an intimate friend!) meaning, the one among the propagators of misguidance who diverted him from true guidance and led him to follow the path of misguidance, whether this refers to Umayyah bin Khalaf or his brother Ubayy bin Khalaf, or to someone else.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóŞóÏú ÃóÖóáøóäöì Úóäö ÇáĞøößúÑö</div><br>  (He indeed led me astray from the Reminder) means the Qur'an,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóÚúÏó ÅöĞú ÌóÂÁóäöì</div><br>  (after it had come to me.) means, after it had reached me. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäõ áöáÅöäúÓóÜäö ÎóĞõæáÇğ</div><br>  (And Shaytan is to man ever a deserter (in the hour of need). ) meaning, he leads him away from the truth and diverts him from it, and uses him for the purposes of falsehood and calls him to it.  </div></body></html>
