Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah commented on this Ayah, "(You, Muslims, are) the best nation of people for the people, you bring them tied in chains on their necks (capture them in war) and they later embrace Islam.'' Similar was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, `Ikrimah, `Ata' and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõäÊõãú ÎóíúÑó ÃõãøóÉò ÃõÎúÑöÌóÊú áöáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (You are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind;) means, the best of peoples for the people.  The meaning of the Ayah is that the Ummah of Muhammad is the most righteous and beneficial nation for mankind. Hence Allah's description of them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊóÃúãõÑõæäó ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö æóÊóäúåóæúäó Úóäö ÇáúãõäúßóÑö æóÊõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö</div><br>  (you enjoin Al-Ma`ruf and forbid Al-Munkar and believe in Allah) 3:110.  Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and Al-Hakim recorded that Hakim bin Mu`awiyah bin Haydah narrated that his father said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÊõãú Êõæóİøõæä ÓóÈúÚöíäó ÃõãøóÉğ¡ ÃóäúÊõãú ÎóíúÑõåóÇ¡ æóÃóäúÊõãú ÃóßúÑóãõ Úóáóì Çááåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóá»</div><br>  (You are the final of seventy nations, you are the best and most honored among them to Allah.)  This is a well-known Hadith about which At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan'', and which is also narrated from Mu`adh bin Jabal and Abu Sa`id. The Ummah of Muhammad achieved this virtue because of its Prophet, Muhammad, peace be upon him, the most regarded of Allah's creation and the most honored Messenger with Allah. Allah sent Muhammad with the perfect and complete Law that was never given to any Prophet or Messenger before him. In Muhammad's Law, few deeds take the place of the many deeds that other nations performed. For instance, Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said, "The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃõÚúØöíÊõ ãóÇ áóãú íõÚúØó ÃóÍóÏñ ãöäó ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁ»</div><br>  (I was given what no other Prophet before me was given.)  We said, `O Messenger of Allah!

The chain of narration for this Hadith is Hasan. There are several Hadiths that we should mention here.  The Two Sahihs recorded that Az-Zuhri said that, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said that Abu Hurayrah narrated to him, "I heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÏúÎõáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÜÜÉó ãöäú ÃõãøóÊöí ÒõãúÑóÉñ æóåõãú ÓóÈúÚõæäó ÃóáúİğÇ¡ ÊõÖöíÁõ æõÌõæåõåõãú ÅöÖóÇÁóÉó ÇáúŞóãóÑö áóíúáóÉó ÇáúÈóÏúÑ»</div><br>  İŞÇá ÃÈæ åÑíÑÉ: İŞÇã ÚßÇÔÉ Èä ãÍÕä ÇáÃÓÏí íÑİÚ äãÑÉ Úáíå¡ İŞÇá: íÇ ÑÓæá Çááå¡ ÇÏÚ Çááå Ãä íÌÚáäí ãäåã¡ İŞÇá ÑÓæá ÇááåÕáì Çááå Úáíå æÓáøã:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó ÇÌúÚóáúåõ ãöäúåõã»</div><br>  Ëã ŞÇã ÑÌá ãä ÇáÃäÕÇÑ İŞÇá: íÇ ÑÓæá Çááå ÇÏÚ Çááå Ãä íÌÚáäí ãäåã¡ İŞÇá:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóÈŞóßó ÈöåóÇ ÚõßøóÇÔóÉ»</div><br>  (A group of seventy thousand from my Ummah will enter Paradise, while their faces are radiating, just like the moon when it is full.'`Ukkashah bin Mihsan Al-Asadi stood up, saying, `O Messenger of Allah!

Supplicate to Allah that I am one of them.' The Messenger said, `Ukkashah has beaten you to it.') <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Hadith that Establishes the Virtues of the Ummah of Muhammad in this Life and the Hereafter.</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí áóÃóÑúÌõæ Ãóäú íóßõæäó ãóäú íóÊøóÈöÚõäöí ãöäú ÃõãøóÊöí íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÑõÈõÚó ÇáúÌóäøóÜÜÉ»</div><br>  ŞÇá: İßÈÑäÇ¡ Ëã ŞÇá:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÑúÌõæ Ãóäú íóßõæäõæÇ ËõáõËó ÇáäøóÇÓ»</div><br>  ŞÇá: İßÈÑäÇ¡ Ëã ŞÇá:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÑúÌõæ Ãóäú ÊóßõæäõæÇ ÇáÔøóØúÑ»</div><br>  (`I hope that those who follow me will be one-fourth of the residents of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection.' We said, `Allahu Akbar'. He then said, `I hope that they will be one-third of the people.' We said, `Allahu Akbar'. He then said, `I hope that you will be one-half.')''  Imam Ahmad recorded the same Hadith with another chain of narration, and this Hadith meets the criteria of Muslim in his Sahih. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "The Messenger of Allah said to us,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãóÇ ÊóÑúÖóæúäó Ãóäú ÊóßõæäõæÇ ÑõÈõÚó Ãóåúáö ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉö¿»</div><br>  (Does it please you that you will be one-fourth of the people of Paradise)  We said, `Allahu Akbar!' He added,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãóÇ ÊóÑúÖóæúäó Ãóäú ÊóßõæäõæÇ ËõáõËó Ãóåúáö ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉö¿»</div><br>  (Does it please you that you will be one-third of the people of Paradise) We said, `Allahu Akbar!'

Another Hadith  Imam Ahmad recorded that Buraydah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóåúáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÚöÔúÑõæäó æóãöÇÆóÉõ Õóİó¡ åĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉõ ãöäú Ğáößó ËóãóÇäõæäó ÕóİøğÇ»</div><br>  (The people of Paradise are one hundred and twenty rows, this Ummah takes up eighty of them.)  Imam Ahmad also collected this Hadith through another chain of narration. At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah also collected this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi said, `This Hadith is Hasan. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÍúäõ ÇáúÂÎöÑõæäó ÇáúÃóæøóáõæäó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ äóÍúäõ Ãóæøóáõ ÇáäøóÇÓö ÏõÎõæáğÇ ÇáúÌóäøóÜÜÉó¡ ÈóíúÏó Ãóäøóåõãú ÃõæÊõæÇ ÇáúßöÊóÇÈó ãöäú ŞóÈúáöäóÇ æóÃõæÊöíäóÇåõ ãöäú ÈóÚúÏöåöãú¡ İóåóÏóÇäóÇ Çááåõ áöãóÇ ÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇ İöíåö ãöäó ÇáúÍóŞøö¡ İóåóĞóÇ Çáúíóæúãõ ÇáøóĞöí ÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇ İöíåö¡ ÇáäøóÇÓõ áóäóÇ İöíåö ÊóÈóÚñ¡ ÛóÏğÇ áöáúíóåõæÏö¡ æóáöáäøóÕóÇÑóì ÈóÚúÏó ÛóÏ»</div><br>  (We (Muslims) are the last to come, but the foremost on the Day of Resurrection, and the first people to enter Paradise, although the former nations were given the Scriptures before us and we after them. Allah gave us the guidance of truth that they have been disputing about. This (Friday) is the Day that they have been disputing about, and all the other people are behind us in this matter: the Jews' (day of congregation is) tomorrow (Saturday) and the Christians' is the day after tomorrow (Sunday). )  Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Muslim recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÍúäõ ÇáúÂÎöÑõæäó ÇáúÃóæøóáõæäó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ äóÍúäõ Ãóæøóáõ ãóäú íóÏúÎõáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÜÜÉ»</div><br>  (We (Muslims) are the last (to come), but (will be) the foremost on the Day of Resurrection, and will be the first people to enter Paradise...) until the end of the Hadith.  These and other Hadiths conform to the meaning of the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõäÊõãú ÎóíúÑó ÃõãøóÉò ÃõÎúÑöÌóÊú áöáäøóÇÓö ÊóÃúãõÑõæäó ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö æóÊóäúåóæúäó Úóäö ÇáúãõäúßóÑö æóÊõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö</div><br>  (You are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma`ruf (all that Islam has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (all that Islam has forbidden), and you believe in Allah).  Therefore, whoever among this Ummah acquires these qualities, will have a share in this praise. Qatadah said, "We were told that `Umar bin Al-Khattab recited this Ayah 3:110 during a Hajj that he performed, when he saw that the people were rushing. He then said, `Whoever likes to be among this praised Ummah, let him fulfill the condition that Allah set in this Ayah.''' Ibn Jarir recorded this. Those from this Ummah who do not acquire these qualities will be just like the People of the Scriptures whom Allah criticized, when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇäõæÇú áÇó íóÊóäóÜåóæúäó Úóä ãøõäßóÑò İóÚóáõæåõ</div><br>  (They did not forbid one another from the Munkar which they committed. ..) 5:79.  This is the reason why, after Allah praised the Muslim Ummah with the qualities that He mentioned, He criticized the People of the Scriptures and chastised them, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÁóÇãóäó Ãóåúáõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö</div><br>  (And had the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) believed) 3:110,  in what was sent down to Muhammad ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóßóÇäó ÎóíúÑÇğ áøóåõãú ãøöäúåõãõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó æóÃóßúËóÑõåõãõ ÇáúİóÜÓöŞõæäó</div><br>  (it would have been better for them; among them are some who have faith, but most of them are Fasiqun (rebellious).)  Therefore only a few of them believe in Allah and in what was sent down to you and to them. The majority of them follow deviation, disbelief, sin and rebellion. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Good News that Muslims will Dominate the People of the Book</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  While delivering the good news to His believing servants that victory and dominance will be theirs against the disbelieving, atheistic People of the Scriptures, Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä íóÖõÑøõæßõãú ÅöáÇøó ÃóĞğì æóÅöä íõŞóÜÊöáõæßõãú íõæóáøõæßõãõ ÇáÇøñÏõÈóÇÑó Ëõãøó áÇó íõäÕóÑõæäó </div><br>  (They will do you no harm, barring a trifling annoyance; and if they fight against you, they will show you their backs, and they will not be helped.) 3:111  This is what occurred, for at the battle of Khaybar, Allah brought humiliation and disgrace to the Jews. Before that, the Jews in Al-Madinah, the tribes of Qaynuqa`, Nadir and Qurayzah, were also humiliated by Allah. Such was the case with the Christians in the area of Ash-Sham later on, when the Companions defeated them in many battles and took over the leadership of Ash-Sham forever. There shall always be a group of Muslims in Ash-Sham area until `Isa, son of Maryam, descends while they are like this on the truth, apparent and victorious. `Isa will at that time rule according to the Law of Muhammad , break the cross, kill the swine, banish the Jizyah and only accept Islam from the people.  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÖõÑöÈóÊú Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáĞøöáøóÉõ Ãóíúäó ãóÇ ËõŞöİõæÇú ÅöáÇøó ÈöÍóÈúáò ãøöäú Çááøóåö æóÍóÈúáò ãøöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (Indignity is put over them wherever they may be, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah, and a covenant from men;) meaning, Allah has placed humiliation and disgrace on them wherever they may be, and they will never be safe,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÈöÍóÈúáò ãøöäú Çááøóåö</div><br>  (except when under a covenant from Allah,) under the Dhimmah (covenant of protection) from Allah that requires them to pay the Jizyah (tax, to Muslims,) and makes them subservient to Islamic Law.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍóÈúáò ãøöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (and a covenant from men;) meaning, covenant from men, such as pledges of protection and safety offered to them by Muslim men and women, and even a slave, according to one of the sayings of the scholars. Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÈöÍóÈúáò ãøöäú Çááøóåö æóÍóÈúáò ãøöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (except when under a covenant from Allah, and a covenant from men;) refers to a covenant of protection from Allah and a pledge of safety from people. Similar was said by Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóÂÁõæÇ ÈöÛóÖóÈò ãøöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (they have drawn on themselves the wrath of Allah,) means, they earned Allah's anger, which they deserved,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÖõÑöÈóÊú Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáúãóÓúßóäóÉõ</div><br>  (and destitution is put over them), meaning they deserve it by decree and legislatively.

We seek refuge from this behavior, and Allah Alone is sought for each and every type of help.  </div></body></html>
