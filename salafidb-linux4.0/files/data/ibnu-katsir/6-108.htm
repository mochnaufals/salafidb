Insulting their deities will lead to a bigger evil than its benefit, for the idolators might retaliate by insulting the God of the believers, Allah, none has the right to be worshipped but He. `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah 6:108; "They (disbelievers) said, `O Muhammad! You will stop insulting our gods, or we will insult your Lord.' Thereafter, Allah prohibited the believers from insulting the disbelievers' idols,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíóÓõÈøõæÇú Çááøóåó ÚóÏúæÇğ ÈöÛóíúÑö Úöáúãò</div><br>  (lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge.)'' `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma`mar said that Qatadah said, "Muslims used to insult the idols of the disbelievers and the disbelievers would retaliate by insulting Allah wrongfully without knowledge. Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÓõÈøõæÇú ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÏúÚõæäó ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And insult not those whom they worship besides Allah.)'' On this same subject -- abandoning what carries benefit to avert a greater evil - it is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóáúÚõæäñ ãóäú ÓóÈøó æóÇáöÏóíúå»</div><br>  (Cursed is he who insults his own parents!) They said, "O Allah's Messenger! And how would a man insult his own parents'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÓõÈøõ ÃóÈóÇ ÇáÑøóÌõáö İóíóÓõÈøõ ÃóÈóÇåõ æóíóÓõÈøõ Ãõãøóåõ İóíóÓõÈøõ Ãõãøóå»</div><br>  (He insults a man's father, and that man insults his father, and insults his mother and that man insults his mother.)

Allah's is the most perfect proof, and the most complete wisdom in all that He wills and chooses.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó Åöáóì ÑóÈøöåöãú ãøóÑúÌöÚõåõãú</div><br>  (then to their Lord is their return,) gathering and final destination,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíõäóÈøöÆõåõãú ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (and He shall then inform them of all that they used to do.)
