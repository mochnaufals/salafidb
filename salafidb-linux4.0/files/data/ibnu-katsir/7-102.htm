Those were the towns whose story We relate unto you. And there came indeed to them their Messengers with clear proofs, but they were not such who would believe in what they rejected before. Thus Allah does seal up the hearts of the disbelievers.) (102. And most of them We found not true to their covenant, but most of them We found indeed rebellious.)  After narrating the stories of the people of Prophets Nuh, Hud, Salih, Lut and Shu`ayb, destroying the disbelievers, saving the believers, warning these nations by explaining the truth to them with the evidence sent in the words of His Messengers, may Allah's peace and blessings be on them all, Allah said;</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÇáúŞõÑóì äóŞõÕøõ Úóáóíúßó</div><br>  (Those were the towns that We relate to you) O Muhammad,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöäú ÃóäÈóÂÆöåóÇ</div><br>  (their story), and news,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ÑõÓõáõåõã ÈöÇáúÈóíøöäóÜÊö</div><br>  (And there came indeed to them their Messengers with clear proofs,) and evidences of the truth of what they brought them.

We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves.) 11:100-101 Allah said   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú áöíõÄúãöäõæÇú ÈöãóÇ ßóĞøóÈõæÇú ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (but they were not such who would believe in what they had rejected before.) meaning they would not have later on believed in what the Messengers brought them, because they denied the truth when it first came to them (although they recognized it), according to the Tafsir of Ibn `Atiyyah. This explanation is sound, and is supported by Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõÔúÚöÑõßõãú ÃóäøóåóÂ ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊú áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäóæóäõŞóáøöÈõ ÃóİúÆöÏóÊóåõãú æóÃóÈúÕóÜÑóåõãú ßóãóÇ áóãú íõÄúãöäõæÇú Èöåö Ãóæøóáó ãóÑøóÉò</div><br>  (And what will make you perceive that if it came, they will not believe And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance), as they refused to believe therein for the first time.) 6:109-110 This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó íóØúÈóÚõ Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈö ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäóæóãóÇ æóÌóÏúäóÇ áÇøğßúËóÑöåöã</div><br>  (Thus Allah does seal up the hearts of the disbelievers. And most of them We found not...) meaning, We did not find most of the previous nations,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöäú ÚóåúÏò æóÅöä æóÌóÏúäóÂ ÃóßúËóÑóåõãú áóİóÜÓöŞöíäó</div><br>  (true to their covenant, but most of them We found to indeed be rebellious.)  This Ayah means, We found most of them to be rebellious, deviating away from obedience and compliance. The covenant mentioned here is the Fitrah that Allah instilled in them while still in their fathers' loins, and taking their covenant, that He is their Lord, King, and that there is no deity worthy of worship except Him,. They affirmed this covenant and testified against themselves to this fact. However, they defied this covenant, threw it behind their backs and worshipped others besides Allah, having no proof or plea, nor support from rationality or by divine law. Surely, the pure Fitrah defies these actions, while all the honorable Messengers, from beginning to end, forbade them. Muslim collected the Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì Åöäøöí ÎóáóŞúÊõ ÚöÈóÇÏöí ÍõäóİóÇÁó İóÌóÇÁóÊúåõãõ ÇáÔøóíóÇØöíäõ İóÇÌúÊóÇáóÊúåõãú Úóäú Ïöíäöåöãú æóÍóÑøóãóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ãóÇ ÃóÍúáóáúÊõ áóåõã»</div><br>  (Allah said, "I created My servants Hunafa' (monotheists), but the devils came to them and deviated them from their religion and prohibited them what I allowed them.'') It is recorded in the Two Sahihs,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáøõ ãóæúáõæÏò íõæáóÏõ Úóáóì ÇáúİöØúÑóÉö İóÃóÈóæóÇåõ íõåóæøöÏóÇäöåö æóíõäóÕøöÑóÇäöåö æóíõãóÌøöÓóÇäöå»</div><br>  (Every child is born upon the Fitrah, it is only his parents who turn him into a Jew, a Christian or a Zoroastrian.)  </div></body></html>
