Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others said that Al-Aykah refers to intertwined trees. Their evildoing included associating partners with Allah (Shirk), banditry and cheating in weights and measures. Allah punished them with the Sayhah (the awful cry or torment), the earthquake, and the torment of the Day of Shadow. They lived near the people of Lut, but at a later time, and the people of Lut were known to them, which is why Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõãóÇ áóÈöÅöãóÇãò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (They are both on an open route, plain to see.)
