He later on became sorry and sent his people to, `Ask the Messenger of Allah for me, if I can repent.' Then,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóíúİó íóåúÏöì Çááøóåõ ŞóæúãğÇ ßóİóÑõæÇú ÈóÚúÏó ÅöíãóÜäöåöãú</div><br>  (How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief) until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) was revealed and his people sent word to him and he re-embraced Islam.''  This is the wording recorded by An-Nasa'i, Al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban. Al-Hakim said, "Its chain is Sahih and they did not record it.''  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóíúİó íóåúÏöì Çááøóåõ ŞóæúãğÇ ßóİóÑõæÇú ÈóÚúÏó ÅöíãóÜäöåöãú æóÔóåöÏõæÇú Ãóäøó ÇáÑøóÓõæáó ÍóŞøñ æóÌóÂÁóåõãõ ÇáúÈóíøöäóÜÊõ</div><br>  (How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and after they bore witness that the Messenger is true and after clear proofs came to them)  means, the proofs and evidences were established, testifying to the truth of what the Messenger was sent with. The truth was thus explained to them, but they reverted to the darkness of polytheism. Therefore, how can such people deserve guidance after they willingly leapt into utter blindness This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ áÇó íóåúÏöì ÇáúŞóæúãó ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (And Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers.)  He then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÌóÒóÂÄõåõãú Ãóäøó Úóáóíúåöãú áóÚúäóÉó Çááøóåö æóÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö æóÇáäøóÇÓö ÃóÌúãóÚöíäó </div><br>  (They are those whose recompense is that on them (rests) the curse of Allah, of the angels and of all mankind.)  Allah curses them and His creation also curses them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÂ</div><br>  (They will abide therein) in the curse,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íõÎóİøóİõ Úóäúåõãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ æóáÇó åõãú íõäÙóÑõæäó</div><br>  (Neither will their torment be lightened nor will it be delayed or postponed.) for, the torment will not be lessened, not even for an hour. After that, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóÇÈõæÇú ãöä ÈóÚúÏö Ğóáößó æóÃóÕúáóÍõæÇú İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (Except for those who repent after that and do righteous deeds. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)  This Ayah indicates Allah's kindness, graciousness, compassion, mercy and favor on His creatures when they repent to Him, for He forgives them in this case.  </div></body></html>
