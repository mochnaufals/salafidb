Musa said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÍúáõáú ÚõŞúÏóÉğ ãøöä áøöÓóÇäöì - íóİúŞóåõæÇú Şóæúáöí - æóÇÌúÚóá áøöì æóÒöíÑÇğ ãøöäú Ãóåúáöì - åóÜÑõæäó ÃóÎöì - ÇÔúÏõÏú Èöåö ÃóÒúÑöì - æóÃóÔúÑößúåõ İöì ÃóãúÑöì </div><br>  ("And loose the knot (the defect) from my tongue.

(20:27-32) meaning, `give me someone to keep me company in this immense task of prophethood and conveying the Message to this arrogant, tyrannical and stubborn king.
