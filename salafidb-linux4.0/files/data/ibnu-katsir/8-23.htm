Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóæóáøóæúÇú Úóäúåõ</div><br>  (and turn not away from him...), neither refrain from obeying him or following his commands nor indulge in what he forbade,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÊõãú ÊóÓúãóÚõæäó</div><br>  (while you are hearing.) after you gained knowledge of his Message,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóßõæäõæÇú ßóÇáøóĞöíäó ŞóÇáõæÇú ÓóãöÚúäóÇ æóåõãú áÇó íóÓúãóÚõæäó </div><br>  (And be not like those who say: "We have heard,'' but they hear not.)  Ibn Ishaq said that this Ayah refers to the hypocrites, who pretend to hear and obey, while in fact they do neither. Allah declares that these are the most wicked creatures among the Children of Adam,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÔóÑøó ÇáÏøóæóÇÈøö ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö ÇáÕøõãøõ</div><br>  (Verily, the worst of living creatures with Allah are the deaf) who do not hear the truth,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÈõßúãõ</div><br>  (and the dumb) who cannot comprehend it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (who understand not. ) These indeed are the most wicked creatures, for every creature except them abide by the way that Allah created in them. These people were created to worship Allah, but instead disbelieved. This is why Allah equated them to animals, when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóËóáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ßóãóËóáö ÇáøóĞöì íóäúÚöŞõ ÈöãóÇ áÇó íóÓúãóÚõ ÅöáÇøó ÏõÚóÂÁğ æóäöÏóÂÁğ</div><br>  (And the example of those who disbelieve is as that of him who shouts to those that hear nothing but calls and cries.) 2:171, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ßóÇáÃóäúÚóÜãö Èóáú åõãú ÃóÖóáøõ ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÛóÜİöáõæäó</div><br>  (They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones.) 7:179  It was also said that the Ayah (8:22) refers to some of the pagans of Quraysh from the tribe of Bani `Abd Ad-Dar, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Ibn Jarir. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that this Ayah refers to hypocrites, as we stated. There is no contradiction here, because both disbelievers and hypocrites are devoid of sound comprehension, in addition to having lost the intention to do good. Allah states here that such are those who neither have sound understanding nor good intentions, even if they have some type of reason,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú Úóáöãó Çááøóåõ İöíåöãú ÎóíúÑğÇ áÃóÓúãóÚóåõãú</div><br>  (Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen.)  He would have helped them understand. However, this did not happen because there is no goodness in such people, for Allah knows that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÃóÓúãóÚóåõãú</div><br>  (even if He had made them listen...) and allowed them to understand,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÊóæóáøóæÇú</div><br>  (they would but have turned...), intentionally and out of stubbornness, even after they comprehend,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõã ãøõÚúÑöÖõæäó</div><br>  (with aversion.), to the truth.  </div></body></html>
