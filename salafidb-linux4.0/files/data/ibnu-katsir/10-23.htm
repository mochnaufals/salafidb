Certainly, Our messengers (angels) record all of that which you plot.) (22. He it is Who enables you to travel through land and sea, till when you are in the ships, and they sail with them with a favorable wind, and they are glad therein, then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think that they are encircled therein. Then they invoke Allah, making their faith pure for Him (alone), (saying): "If You (Allah) deliver us from this, we shall truly, be of the grateful.'') (23. But when He delivers them, behold! They rebel (disobey Allah) in the earth wrongfully. O mankind! Your rebellion is only against yourselves, -- a brief enjoyment of this worldly life, then (in the end) unto Us is your return, and We shall inform you of that which you used to do.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Man changes when He receives Mercy after Times of Distress</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah tells us that when He makes men feel His mercy after being afflicted with distress,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ áóåõãú ãøóßúÑñ İöì ÁÇíóÜÊöäóÇ</div><br>  (They take to plotting against Our Ayat.) The coming of mercy after distress is like the coming of ease after hardship, fertility after aridity, and rain after drought. Mujahid said that man's attitude indicates a mockery and belying of blessings. The meaning here is similar to Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÓøó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ÇáÖøõÑøõ ÏóÚóÇäóÇ áöÌóäÈöåö Ãóæú ŞóÇÚöÏğÇ Ãóæú ŞóÂÆöãğÇ</div><br>  (And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or standing.)(10:12) Al-Bukhari recorded that Allah's Messenger led the Subh (Dawn) prayer after it had rained during the night, then he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóáú ÊóÏúÑõæäó ãóÇĞóÇ ŞóÇáó ÑóÈøõßõãõ ÇááøóíúáóÉó¿»</div><br>  (Do you know what your Lord has said last night) They replied, "Allah and His Messenger know better.''

He who said: `We have had this rainfall due to the grace and mercy of Allah' is a believer in Me and a disbeliever in the stars. And he who said `we have had this rainfall due to the rising of such and such star' is a disbeliever in Me and a believer in the stars.) The Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáö Çááøóåõ ÃóÓúÑóÚõ ãóßúÑğÇ</div><br>  (Say: "Allah is more swift in planning!'') means that Allah is more capable of gradually seizing them with punishment, while granting them concession of a delay until the criminals think that they would not be punished. But in reality they are in periods of respite, then they will be taken suddenly. The noble writers (meaning the angels who write the deeds) will write everything that they do and keep count of their deeds. Then they will present it before the All-Knowing of the seen and unseen worlds. The Lord will then reward them for the significant deeds and even the seemingly insignificant that may be as tiny as a spot on a date pit. Allah further states:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöì íõÓóíøöÑõßõãú İöì ÇáúÈóÑøö æóÇáúÈóÍúÑö</div><br>  (He it is Who enables you to travel through land and sea...) which means that He preserves you and maintains you with His care and watching.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ßõäÊõãú İöì Çáúİõáúßö æóÌóÑóíúäó Èöåöã ÈöÑöíÍò ØóíøöÈóÉò æóİóÑöÍõæÇú ÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (Till when you are in the ships, and they sail with them with a favorable wind, and they are glad therein...) meaning smoothly and calmly;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌóÂÁóÊúåóÇ</div><br>  (then comes (these ships))   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑöíÍñ ÚóÇÕöİñ</div><br>  (a stormy wind)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÂÁóåõãõ ÇáúãóæúÌõ ãöä ßõáøö ãóßóÇäò</div><br>  o(and the waves come to them from all sides, )   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÙóäøõæÇú Ãóäøóåõãú ÃõÍöíØó Èöåöãú</div><br>  (and they think that they are encircled therein) meaning that are going to be destroyed.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏóÚóæõÇú Çááøóåó ãõÎúáöÕöíäó áóåõ ÇáÏøöíäó</div><br>  (Then they invoke Allah, making their faith pure for Him (alone)) meaning that in this situation they would not invoke an idol or statue besides Allah. They would single Him out alone for their supplications and prayers. This is similar to Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÓøóßõãõ ÇáúÖøõÑøõ İöì ÇáúÈóÍúÑö Öóáøó ãóä ÊóÏúÚõæäó ÅöáÇó ÅöíøóÇåõ İóáóãøóÇ äóÌøóÜßõãú Åöáóì ÇáúÈóÑøö ÃóÚúÑóÖúÊõãú æóßóÇäó ÇáÅöäúÓóÜäõ ßóİõæÑğÇ </div><br>  (And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon vanish from you except Him (Allah alone). But when He brings you safe to land, you turn away (from Him). And man is ever ungrateful.) 17:67 And in this Surah, He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏóÚóæõÇú Çááøóåó ãõÎúáöÕöíäó áóåõ ÇáÏøöíäó áóÆöäú ÃóäúÌóíúÊóäóÇ ãöäú åóÜĞöåö</div><br>  (They invoke Allah, making their faith pure for Him (saying): "If You (Allah) deliver us from this (situation).'')   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóäóßõæäóäøó ãöäó ÇáÔøóÜßöÑöíäó</div><br>  ("We shall truly, be of the grateful.'') This means that we will not ascribe others as partners with You. We will later worship You alone as we are praying to You here and now. Allah states;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÂ ÃóäÌóÇåõãú</div><br>  (But when He delivers them) from that distress,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ åõãú íóÈúÛõæäó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÈöÛóíúÑö ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (behold!

So Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÃóä áøóãú íóÏúÚõäóÂ Åöáóì ÖõÑøò ãøóÓøóåõ</div><br>  (He passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!)10:12  Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÅöäøóãóÇ ÈóÛúíõßõãú Úóáóì ÃóäİõÓößõãú</div><br>  (O mankind!

Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÊóÇÚó ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ</div><br>  (a brief enjoyment of this worldly life...) means that you only have a short enjoyment in this low and abased worldly life.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÅöáóíäóÇ ãóÑúÌöÚõßõãú</div><br>  (then (in the end) unto Us is your return...) meaning your goal and final destination.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóäõäóÈøöÆõßõãú</div><br>  (and We shall inform you) of all your deeds.
