(He was) thankful for His (Allah's) favors. He (Allah) chose him (as an intimate friend) and guided him to a straight path. And We gave him good in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous. Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): "Follow the religion of Ibrahim, (he was a) Hanif, and he was not of the Mushrikin'') 16:120-123. Ordering the Prophet to follow the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanifiyyah, does not mean that Prophet Ibrahim reached more perfection in it than our Prophet . Rather, our Prophet perfectly established the religion and it was completed for him; and none before him reached this level of perfection. This is why he is the Final Prophet, the chief of all the Children of Adam who holds the station of praise and glory, the honor of intercession on the Day of Resurrection. All creation (on that Day) will seek him, even Ibrahim the friend of Allah, peace be upon him to request the beginning of Judgement.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "The Messenger of Allah was asked, `Which religion is the best with Allah, the Exalted' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÍóäöíİöíøóÉõ ÇáÓøóãúÍóÉ»</div><br>  (Al-Hanifiyyah As-Samhah (the easy monotheism))'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command for Sincerity in Worship</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Åöäøó ÕóáÇóÊöì æóäõÓõßöì æóãóÍúíóÇìó æóãóãóÇÊöì ááøóåö ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (Say: "Verily, my Salah, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the all that exists.") Allah commands the Prophet to inform the idolators who worship other than Allah and sacrifice to something other than Him, that he opposes them in all this, for his prayer is for Allah, and his rituals are in His Name alone, without partners. Allah said in a similar statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÕóáøö áöÑóÈøößó æóÇäúÍóÑú </div><br>  (Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice.) 108:2, meaning, make your prayer and sacrifice for Allah alone. As for the idolators, they used to worship the idols and sacrifice to them, so Allah commanded the Prophet to defy them and contradict their practices. Allah, the Exalted, commanded him to dedicate his intention and heart to being sincere for Him alone. Mujahid commented,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÕóáÇóÊöì æóäõÓõßöì</div><br>  (Verily, my prayer and my Nusuk...) refers to sacrificing during Hajj and `Umrah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Islam is the Religion of all Prophets</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäóÇú Ãóæøóáõ ÇáúãõÓúáöãöíäó</div><br>  (and I am the first of the Muslims.) means, from this Ummah, according to Qatadah. This is a sound meaning, because all Prophets before our Prophet were calling to Islam, which commands worshipping Allah alone without partners.

Later on, the Law sent with Muhammad abrogated all previous laws and nothing will ever abrogate it, forever. Certainly, Muhammad's Law will always be apparent and its flags raised high, until the Day of Resurrection.
