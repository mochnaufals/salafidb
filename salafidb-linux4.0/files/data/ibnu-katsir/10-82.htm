Fir`awn, may Allah's curse be upon him, wanted to deceive the people and impress them with the tricks of the magicians in direct opposition to the plain truth that Musa brought. The result was the exact opposite and he therefore didn't attain his goal. The signs of the Lord prevailed in that public festival.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõáúŞöìó ÇáÓøóÍóÑóÉõ ÓóÜÌöÏöíäó - ŞóÇáõæÇú ÁóÇãóäøóÇ ÈöÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó - ÑóÈøö ãõæÓóì æóåóÜÑõæäó </div><br>  (And the sorcerers fell down prostrate. They said: "We believe in the Lord of all that exists -- the Lord of Musa and Harun.'')(7:120-122)  Fir`awn thought that he would achieve victory through the magicians over the Messenger sent by Allah, the All-Knower of all hidden things. But he failed, lost Paradise and was deserving of the Hellfire.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó İöÑúÚóæúäõ ÇÆúÊõæäöì Èößõáøö ÓóÜÍöÑò Úóáöíãò - İóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁó ÇáÓøóÍóÑóÉõ ŞóÇáó áóåõãú ãøõæÓóì ÃóáúŞõæÇú ãóÂ ÃóäÊõãú ãøõáúŞõæäó </div><br>  (And Fir`awn said: "Bring me every well-versed sorcerer.'' And when the sorcerers came, Musa said to them: "Cast down what you want to cast!'') They stood in line after they received the promise of Fir`awn to become closer to him and obtain a generous reward. Musa wanted them to begin. He wanted the people to see what the magicians had made, then he would come with the truth after that to triumph over their falsehood.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú íãõæÓóì ÅöãøóÂ Ãóä ÊõáúŞöìó æóÅöãøóÂ Ãóä äøóßõæäó Ãóæøóáó ãóäú ÃóáúŞóì ŞóÇáó Èóáú ÃóáúŞõæÇú</div><br>  (They said: "O Musa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw'' Musa said: "Nay, throw you (first)!'') When the magicians cast their spells they bewitched the eyes of the people through their display of mighty sorcery.
