It was recorded by Ibn Jarir from Ibn `Abbas. He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóÇäó ÃóÈóæóÇåõ ãõÄúãöäóíúäö İóÎóÔöíäóÂ Ãóä íõÑúåöŞóåõãóÇ ØõÛúíóÜäÇğ æóßõİúÑÇğ</div><br>  (his parents were believers, and we feared he would oppress them by rebellion and disbelief) Their love for him might make them follow him in disbelief. Qatadah said, "His parents rejoiced when he was born and grieved for him when he was killed. If he had stayed alive, he would have been the cause of their doom. So let a man be content with the decree of Allah, for the decree of Allah for the believer, if he dislikes it, is better for him than if He were to decree something that he likes for him.'' An authentic Hadith says;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóŞúÖöí Çááåõ áöáúãõÄúãöäö ãöäú ŞóÖóÇÁò ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóå»</div><br>  (Allah does not decree anything for the believer except it is good for him.) And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóÓóì Ãóä ÊóßúÑóåõæÇú ÔóíúÆğÇ æóåõæó ÎóíúÑñ áøóßõãú</div><br>  (and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you.) 2:216.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÑóÏúäóÂ Ãóä íõÈúÏöáóåõãóÇ ÑóÈøõåõãóÇ ÎóíúÑÇğ ãøöäúåõ ÒóßóÜæÉğ æóÃóŞúÑóÈó ÑõÍúãÇğ </div><br>  (So we intended that their Lord should exchange him for them for one better in righteousness and nearer to mercy. ) A child who was better than this one, a child for whom they would feel more compassion. This was the view of Ibn Jurayj.  </div></body></html>
