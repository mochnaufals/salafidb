It is so called because it is close, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÒöİóÊö ÇáÇøñÒöİóÉõ - áóíúÓó áóåóÇ ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ßóÇÔöİóÉñ </div><br>  (The Day of Resurrection draws near. None besides Allah can avert it) (53:57-58)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÊóÑóÈóÊö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ æóÇäÔóŞøó ÇáúŞóãóÑõ </div><br>  (The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder) (54:1)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇŞúÊóÑóÈó áöáäøóÇÓö ÍöÓóÜÈõåõãú</div><br>  (Draws near for mankind their reckoning) (21:1),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊóì ÃóãúÑõ Çááøóåö İóáÇó ÊóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõæåõ</div><br>  (The Event (the Hour) ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it) (16:1),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÃóæúåõ ÒõáúİóÉğ ÓöíÆóÊú æõÌõæåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (But when they will see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will change and turn black with sadness and in grief) (67:27), and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞö ÇáúŞõáõæÈõ áóÏóì ÇáúÍóäóÇÌöÑö ßóÜÙöãöíäó</div><br>  (when the hearts will be at the throats Kazimin. ) Qatadah said, "When the hearts reach the throats because of fear, and they will neither come out nor go back to their places.'' This was also the view of `Ikrimah, As-Suddi and others.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÜÙöãöíäó</div><br>  (Kazimin) means silent, for no one will speak without His permission:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóŞõæãõ ÇáÑøõæÍõ æóÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ ÕóİøÇğ áÇøó íóÊóßóáøóãõæäó ÅöáÇøó ãóäú ÃóĞöäó áóåõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ æóŞóÇáó ÕóæóÇÈÇğ </div><br>  (The Day that Ar-Ruh (Jibril) and the angels will stand forth in rows, they will not speak except him whom the Most Gracious allows, and he will speak what is right.) (78:38). Ibn Jurayj said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÜÙöãöíäó</div><br>  (Kazimin) "It means weeping.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ áöáÙøóÜáöãöíäó ãöäú Íóãöíãò æóáÇó ÔóİöíÚò íõØóÇÚõ</div><br>  (There will be no friend, nor an intercessor for the wrongdoers, who could be given heed to.) means, those who wronged themselves by associating others in worship with Allah, will have no relative to help them and no intercessor who can plead on their behalf; all means of good will be cut off from them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚúáóãõ ÎóÂÆöäóÉó ÇáÇøñÚúíõäö æóãóÇ ÊõÎúİöì ÇáÕøõÏõæÑõ </div><br>  (Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal.) Allah tells us about His complete knowledge which encompasses all things, great and small, major and minor, so that people will take note that He knows about them and they will have the proper sense of shyness before Allah. They will pay attention to the fact that He can see them, for He knows the fraud of the eyes, even if the eyes look innocent, and He knows what the hearts conceal. Ad-Dahhak said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÂÆöäóÉó ÇáÇøñÚúíõäö</div><br>  (the fraud of the eyes,) "A wink and a man saying that he has seen something when he has not seen it, or saying that he has not seen it when he did see it.'' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Allah knows when the eye looks at something, whether it wants to commit an act of betrayal or not.'' This was also the view of Mujahid and Qatadah. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊõÎúİöì ÇáÕøõÏõæÑõ</div><br>  (and all that the breasts conceal.)"He knows, if you were able to, whether you would commit Zina with a woman or not.'' As-Suddi said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊõÎúİöì ÇáÕøõÏõæÑõ</div><br>  (and all that the breasts conceal.) meaning, of insinuating whispers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóŞúÖöì ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (And Allah judges with truth, ) means, He judges with justice. Al-A`mash narrated from Sa`id bin Jubayr from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that this Ayah means: "He is able to reward those who do good with good and those who do evil with evil.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó åõæó ÇáÓøóãöíÚõ ÇáúÈóÕöíÑõ</div><br>  (Certainly, Allah! He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.) This is how it was interpreted by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíóÌúÒöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÓóÇÁõæÇú ÈöãóÇ ÚóãöáõæÇú æóíöÌúÒöì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÍúÓóäõæÇú ÈöÇáúÍõÓúäóì</div><br>  (that He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done, and reward those who do good, with what is best) (53:31).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó íóÏúÚõæäó ãöä Ïõæäöåö</div><br>  (while those to whom they invoke besides Him,) means, the idols and false gods,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóŞúÖõæäó ÈöÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (cannot judge anything.) means, they do not possess anything and they cannot judge anything.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó åõæó ÇáÓøóãöíÚõ ÇáúÈóÕöíÑõ</div><br>  (Certainly, Allah! He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.) means, He hears all that His creatures say and He knows all about them, so He guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills. And He judges with perfect justice in all of that.  </div></body></html>
