As well as doing this, they also disbelieved in Allah and rejected and opposed His Messenger, they robbed wayfarers, they would lie in wait on the road, kill people and loot their possessions.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÃúÊõæäó İöì äóÇÏöíßõãõ ÇáúãõäúßóÑó</div><br>  (And practice Al-Munkar in your meetings.) This means, `in your gatherings you do and say things that are not befitting, and you do not denounce one another for doing such things.' Some said that they used to have intercourse with one another in public; this was the view of Mujahid. Some said that they used to compete in passing gas and laughing. This was the view of `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, and Al-Qasim. Some of them said that they used to make rams fight one another, or organize cockfights. They used to do all of these things, and they were even eviler than that.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÌóæóÇÈó Şóæúãöåö ÅöáÇøó Ãóä ŞóÇáõæÇú ÇÆúÊöäóÇ ÈöÚóĞóÇÈö Çááøóåö Åöä ßõäÊó ãöäó ÇáÕøóÜÏöŞöíäó</div><br>  (But his people gave no answer except that they said: "Bring Allah's torment upon us if you are one of the truthful.'')
