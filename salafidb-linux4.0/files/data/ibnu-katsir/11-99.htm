This means there was no right guidance in it. It was only ignorance, misguidance, disbelief and stubbornness. Just as they followed him in this life and he was their leader and chief, likewise he will lead them to the Hellfire on the Day of Resurrection. He will lead them directly to it and they will drink from springs of destruction. Fir`awn will have a great share in that awful punishment. This is as Allah, the Exalted, said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÚóÕóì İöÑúÚóæúäõ ÇáÑøóÓõæáó İóÃóÎóĞúäóÜåõ ÃóÎúĞÇğ æóÈöíáÇğ </div><br>  (But Fir`awn disobeyed the Messenger; so We seized him with a severe punishment.)73:16  Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóĞøóÈó æóÚóÕóì - Ëõãøó ÃóÏúÈóÑó íóÓúÚóì - İóÍóÔóÑó İóäóÇÏóì - İóŞóÇáó ÃóäóÇú ÑóÈøõßõãõ ÇáÇøñÚúáóì - İóÃóÎóĞóåõ Çááøóåõ äóßóÇáó ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö æóÇáÇøòæúáóì - Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áóÚöÈúÑóÉğ áøöãóä íóÎúÔóì </div><br>  (But Fir`awn belied and disobeyed. Then he turned his back, striving (against Allah). Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, Saying: "I am your lord, most high.'' So Allah, seized him with exemplary punishment for his last and first transgression. Verily, in this is an instructive admonition for whosoever fears Allah.)79:21-26 Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞúÏõãõ Şóæúãóåõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö İóÃóæúÑóÏóåõãõ ÇáäøóÇÑó æóÈöÆúÓó ÇáúæöÑúÏõ ÇáúãóæúÑõæÏõ </div><br>  (He will go ahead of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and will lead them into the Fire, and evil indeed is the place to which they are led.) This will be the condition of those who were followed. They will have a great share of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áößõáøò ÖöÚúİñ æóáóÜßöä áÇøó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (For each one there is double (torment), but you know not.) 7:38 Allah also says that the disbelievers will say while they are in the Hellfire,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÅöäøóÂ ÃóØóÚúäóÇ ÓóÇÏóÊóäóÇ æóßõÈóÑóÂÁóäóÇ İóÃóÖóáøõæäóÇ ÇáÓøóÈöíáÇúÑóÈøóäóÂ ÁóÇÊöåöãú ÖöÚúİóíúäö ãöäó ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö</div><br>  ("Our Lord!

Mujahid said, "Another curse will be added to them on the Day of Resurrection, so these are two curses.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÆúÓó ÇáÑøöİúÏõ ÇáúãóÑúİõæÏõ</div><br>  (evil indeed is the gift granted.) "The curse of this life and the Hereafter.'' Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah both said the same thing. This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÜåõãú ÃóÆöãøóÉğ íóÏúÚõæäó Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÑö æóíóæúãó ÇáúŞöíÜãóÉö áÇó íõäÕóÑõæäó - æóÃóÊúÈóÚúäóÜåõã İöì åóĞöåö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ áóÚúäóÉğ æóíóæúãó ÇáŞöíóÜãóÉö åõãú ãøöäó ÇáúãóŞúÈõæÍöíäó </div><br>  (And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire: and on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be helped.
