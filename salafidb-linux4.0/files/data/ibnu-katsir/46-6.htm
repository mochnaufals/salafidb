Allah then describes Himself as being of unimaginable glory, possessing ultimate wisdom in His statements and actions. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó æóãóÇ ÈóíúäóåõãóÂ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in truth,) meaning, not in idle play and falsehood.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÌóáñ ãøõÓóãøğì</div><br>  (and for a specified term.) meaning, for a fixed and specified duration that will not increase or decrease. Allah continues,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÚóãøóÂ ÃõäĞöÑõæÇú ãõÚúÑöÖõæäó</div><br>  (But those who disbelieve, turn away from that of which they are warned.) Meaning, the disbelievers are distracted from what is intended for them. Allah has indeed revealed to them a Book and sent to them a Messenger. Yet, they obstinately turn away from all of that. Therefore, they will soon realize the consequence of their behavior. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Refuting the Idolators</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú</div><br>  (Say) meaning, to these idolators who worship others besides Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÑóÃóíúÊõãú ãøóÇ ÊóÏúÚõæäó ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ÃóÑõæäöì ãóÇĞóÇ ÎóáóŞõæÇú ãöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Think you about all that you invoke besides Allah Show me what they have created of the earth) (46:4) meaning, `show me the place that they have independently created from the earth.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú áóåõãú ÔöÑúßñ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö</div><br>  (Or have they a share in the heavens) which means that they are not partners in anything in the heavens, nor on earth. They do not own even the thin membrane covering a date's pit. The dominion and control only belong to Allah, Exalted is He. `How then would you worship others or join them as partners with Him Who guided you to that Who called you to that Did He command you to do it, or is it something that you suggested yourselves' Thus, He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÆúÊõæäöì ÈößöÊóÜÈò ãøöä ŞóÈúáö åóÜĞóÂ</div><br>  (Bring me a scripture prior to this) meaning, `bring a book from among the Books of Allah that have been revealed to the Prophets, that commands you to worship these idols.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÃóËóÜÑóÉò ãøöäú Úöáúãò</div><br>  (or some trace of knowledge,) meaning, `some clear evidence justifying this way you have chosen.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó</div><br>  (if you are truthful!) meaning, `you have absolutely no evidence for that -- neither textual (from revelation) nor rational.' For this reason, some recited it; (Ãóæú ÃóËóÑóÉò ãöäú Úöáúãò) "or something inherited from knowledge'' meaning, `or true knowledge that you have inherited from anyone before you.' This is similar to Mujahid's statement when he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÃóËóÜÑóÉò ãøöäú Úöáúãò</div><br>  (or some trace of knowledge.) "Or anyone who has inherited any knowledge.''

They (the idols) are unaware of what he asks, they can neither hear, see, or act. This is because they are inanimate, senseless stones. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÍõÔöÑó ÇáäøóÇÓõ ßóÇäõæÇú áóåõãú ÃóÚúÏóÂÁğ æóßóÇäõæÇú ÈöÚöÈóÇÏóÊöåöãú ßóÜİöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worship.)

No! They will deny their worship of them, and will be opponents to them.) (19:81, 82) meaning, they will betray them when they need them the most. (Ibrahim) Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇÊøóÎóĞúÊõãú ãøöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ÃóæúËóÜäÇğ ãøóæóÏøóÉó Èóíúäößõãú İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ Ëõãøó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö íóßúİõÑõ ÈóÚúÖõßõãú ÈöÈóÚúÖò æóíóáúÚóäõ ÈóÚúÖõßõãú ÈóÚúÖÇğ æóãóÃúæóÇßõãõ ÇáäøóÇÑõ æóãóÇ áóßõãú ãøöä äøóÜÕöÑöíäó</div><br>  (You have taken only idols besides Allah!
