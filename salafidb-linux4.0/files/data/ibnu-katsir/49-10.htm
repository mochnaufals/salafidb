Therefore, Allah calls both opposing groups among Muslims, believers, although they are fighting each other. Al-Bukhari and other scholars relied on this Hadith as evidence that committing a sin does not nullify faith, no matter how major the sin is. This creed contradicts the creed of the Khawarij sect and those who accepted their idea, such as the Mu`tazilah sect. Al-Bukhari narrated that Al-Hasan said that Abu Bakrah said that the Messenger of Allah gave a speech on the Minbar while Al-Hasan bin `Ali was with him. He was repeatedly looking at Al-Hasan and then at the people; then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇÈúäöí åĞóÇ ÓóíøöÏñ æóáóÚóáøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì Ãóäú íõÕúáöÍó Èöåö Èóíúäó İöÆóÊóíúäö ÚóÙöíãóÊóíúäö ãöäó ÇáúãõÓúáöãöíä»</div><br>  (Verily, this son of mine is a Sayyid (chief or master), and may Allah make peace between two great groups of Muslims through him.) What the Prophet said, occurred. Al-Hasan brought peace between the people of Ash-Sham and `Iraq, after they fought tremendous wars and frightening battles. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä ÈóÛóÊú ÅöÍúÏóÇåõãóÇ Úóáóì ÇáÃõÎúÑóì İóŞóÜÊöáõæÇú ÇáøóÊöì ÊóÈúÛöì ÍóÊøóì ÊóİöìÁó Åöáóì ÃóãúÑö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (But if one of them outrages against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which outrages till it complies with the command of Allah.) means, until the rebellious group refers to the commands of Allah and His Messenger for judgement and they listen to and obey the truth. There is a Hadith in the Sahih in which Anas states that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇäúÕõÑú ÃóÎóÇßó ÙóÇáöãğÇ Ãóæú ãóÙúáõæãğÇ»</div><br>  (Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is oppressed.) "I asked, `O Allah's Messenger! It is right that I help him if he is oppressed, but how should I help him if he is an oppressor' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóãúäóÚõåõ ãöäó ÇáÙøõáúãö İóĞóÇßó äóÕúÑõßó ÅöíøóÇå»</div><br>  (By preventing him from oppressing others; this is how you help him in this case.)'' Sa`id bin Jubayr said that tribes of Aws and Khazraj once got in a scuffle using date tree branches and slippers. Allah revealed this honorable Ayah commanding them to make peace between them. As-Suddi said, "A man from Al-Ansar, whose name was `Imran, had a wife called Umm Zayd. She wanted to visit her family, but her husband prevented her from visiting them by locking her in an upper room. So, none of her family could visit or see her. She sent someone to her family. They came, took her down from the room and wanted to take her away. Her husband was absent at the time, so his family called on their people. Their cousins came to help prevent the wife from going with her family. A push and shove situation occurred that led to them fighting using slippers. This Ayah was then revealed in their case, and the Messenger of Allah sent someone to bring peace between them, and they both agreed to resort to the decision of Allah the Exalted.'' The statement of Allah the Exalted, next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä İóÂÁóÊú İóÃóÕúáöÍõæÇú ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ ÈöÇáúÚóÏúáö æóÃóŞúÓöØõæÇú Åöäøó Çááøóåó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúãõŞúÓöØöíäó</div><br>  (Then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily, Allah loves those who are the equitable.) means, be fair in your judgement regarding the dispute that occurred between them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúãõŞúÓöØöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, Allah loves those who are the equitable.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded, that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáúãõŞúÓöØöíäó İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ Úóáóì ãóäóÇÈöÑó ãöäú áõÄúáõÄò Èóíúäó íóÏóíö ÇáÑøóÍúãäö ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó ÈöãóÇ ÃóŞúÓóØõæÇ İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ»</div><br>  (Verily, those who are equitable in this life, will be on podiums made of pearls before Ar-Rahman, the Exalted and Most Honored, on account of their fairness in this life.) An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó ÅöÎúæóÉñ</div><br>  (The believers are but a brotherhood.) means, all of them are brothers in Islam. The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúãõÓúáöãõ ÃóÎõæ ÇáúãõÓúáöãö áóÇ íóÙúáöãõåõ æóáóÇ íõÓúáöãõå»</div><br>  (The Muslim is the brother of the Muslim, he is not unjust with him nor does he forsake him.) In the Sahih,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇááåõ İöí Úóæúäö ÇáúÚóÈúÏö ãóÇ ßóÇäó ÇáúÚóÈúÏõ İöí Úóæúäö ÃóÎöíå»</div><br>  (Allah helps the servant as long as the servant helps his brother.) Also in the Sahih:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÏóÚóÇ ÇáúãõÓúáöãõ áöÃóÎöíåö ÈöÙóåúÑö ÇáúÛóíúÈö ŞóÇáó Çáúãóáóßõ: Âãöíäó æóáóßó ÈöãöËúáöå»</div><br>  (If the Muslim invokes Allah for the benefit of his absent brother, the angel says afterwards, "Amin, and for you the same.'') There are many Hadiths with this meaning, such as, in the Sahih,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóËóáõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó İöí ÊóæóÇÏøöåöãú æóÊóÑóÇÍõãöåöãú æóÊóæóÇÕõáöåöãú ßóãóËóáö ÇáúÌóÓóÏö ÇáúæóÇÍöÏö¡ ÅöĞóÇ ÇÔúÊóßóì ãöäúåõ ÚõÖúæñ ÊóÏóÇÚóì áóåõ ÓóÇÆöÑõ ÇáúÌóÓóÏö ÈöÇáúÍõãøóì æóÇáÓøóåóÑ»</div><br>  (The parable of the believers in relation to the kindness, mercy and compassion they have for each other, is that of the body: when an organ of it falls ill, the rest of the body responds with fever and sleeplessness.) And also in Sahih.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúãõÄúãöäõ áöáúãõÄúãöäö ßóÇáúÈõäúíóÇäö íóÔõÏøõ ÈóÚúÖõåõ ÈóÚúÖğÇ»</div><br>  (A believer to another believer is like a building whose different parts enforce each other.) The Prophet then clasped his hands with the fingers interlaced.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÕúáöÍõæÇú Èóíúäó ÃóÎóæóíúßõãú</div><br>  (So make reconciliation between your brothers, ) refers to the two groups that fight each other,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó</div><br>  (and have Taqwa of Allah) in all of your affairs,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊõÑúÍóãõæäó</div><br>  (that you may receive mercy.) and this is a promise from Allah that He will grant mercy to those who fear and obey Him.  </div></body></html>
