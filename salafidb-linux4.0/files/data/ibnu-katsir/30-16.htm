This is when the night comes with its darkness, then in the morning the day comes with its light. This glorification is followed by befitting praise, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóåõ ÇáúÍóãúÏõ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (And His is all the praise in the heavens and the earth;) meaning, He is the One who is to be praised for what He has created in the heavens and on earth. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóÔöíøÇğ æóÍöíäó ÊõÙúåöÑõæäó</div><br>  (and in `Ashiyya and when Tuzhirun.) -- the `Ashiyy is the time when the darkness is most intense, and Izhar is the brightest point of the day. Glory be to the One Who created both of them, the Cleaver of the daybreak and the One Who makes night a time of rest. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáäøóåóÇÑö ÅöĞóÇ ÌóáøóÜåóÇ - æóÇáøóíúáö ÅöĞóÇ íóÛúÔóÜåóÇ </div><br>  (By the day as it shows up its brightness. By the night as it conceals it.) (91:3-4)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóíúáö ÅöĞóÇ íóÛúÔóì - æóÇáäøóåóÇÑö ÅöĞóÇ ÊóÌóáøóì </div><br>  (By the night as it envelops. By the day as it appears in brightness. ) (92:1-2)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÖøõÍóì - æóÇáøóíúáö ÅöĞóÇ ÓóÌóì </div><br>  (By the forenoon (after sunrise). By the night when it darkens.) (93:1-2) And there are many similar Ayat.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÎúÑöÌõ ÇáúÍóìøó ãöäó ÇáúãóíøöÊö æóíõÎúÑöÌõ ÇáúãóíøöÊó ãöäó ÇáúÍóìøö</div><br>  (He brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living.) This is what we see of His power to create things and their opposites. These Ayat which come one after the other are all of the same; in each of them Allah mentions the creation of things and their opposites, to indicate to His creation the perfection of His power. Thus He creates the plant from the seed and the seed from the plant; He creates the egg from the chicken and the chicken from the egg; He creates man from sperm and sperm from man; He creates the believer from the disbelievers and the disbeliever from the believers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÍúìö ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ÈóÚúÏó ãóæúÊöåóÇ</div><br>  (And He revives the earth after its death.) This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇíóÉñ áøóåõãõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ÇáúãóíúÊóÉõ ÃóÍúíóíúäóÜåóÇ æóÃóÎúÑóÌúäóÇ ãöäúåóÇ ÍóÈøÇğ İóãöäúåõ íóÃúßõáõæäó </div><br>  (And a sign for them is the dead land. We give it life, and We bring forth from it grains, so that they eat thereof.) until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİóÌøóÑúäóÇ İöíåóÇ ãöäó ÇáúÚõíõæäö</div><br>  (and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein. ) (36:33-34)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóì ÇáÇøñÑúÖó åóÇãöÏóÉğ İóÅöĞóÂ ÃóäÒóáúäóÇ ÚóáóíúåóÇ ÇáúãóÂÁó ÇåúÊóÒøóÊú æóÑóÈóÊú æóÃóäÈóÊóÊú ãöä ßõáøö ÒóæúÌò ÈóåöíÌò</div><br>  (And you see the earth barren, but when We send down water on it, it is stirred, and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind.) until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó Çááøóåó íóÈúÚóËõ ãóä İöì ÇáúŞõÈõæÑö</div><br>  (and certainly, Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.) (22:5-7)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íõÑúÓöáõ ÇáÑøöíóÇÍó ÈõÔúÑìğ Èóíúäó íóÏóìú ÑóÍúãóÊöåö ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÂ ÃóŞóáøóÊú ÓóÍóÇÈğÇ ËöŞóÇáÇğ</div><br>  (And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy. Till when they have carried a heavy-laden cloud) until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (so that you may remember or take heed.) (7:57) Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞóáößó ÊõÎúÑóÌõæäó</div><br>  (And thus shall you be brought out.)  </div></body></html>
