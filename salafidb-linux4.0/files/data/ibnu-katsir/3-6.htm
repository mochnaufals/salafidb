This Ayah refers to the fact that `Isa, son of Mary, is a created servant, just as Allah created the rest of mankind. Allah created `Isa in the womb (of his mother) and shaped him as He willed. Therefore, how could `Isa be divine, as the Christians, may Allah's curses descend on them, claim `Isa was created in the womb and his creation changed from stage to stage, just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÎúáõŞõßõãú İöì ÈõØõæäö ÃõãøóåóÜÊößõÜãú ÎóáúŞÇğ ãøöä ÈóÚúÏö ÎóáúŞò İöì ÙõáõãóÜÊò ËóáóÜËò</div><br>  (He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation in three veils of darkness.) 39:6.  </div></body></html>
