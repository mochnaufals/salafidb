Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. They made this claim in spite of the fact that `Isa made it known that he was the servant of Allah and His Messenger. The first words that `Isa uttered when he was still a baby in the cradle were, "I am `Abdullah (the servant of Allah).'' He did not say, "I am Allah,'' or, "I am the son of Allah.''

Mujahid and several others said that this Ayah was revealed about the Christians in particular. As-Suddi and others said that this Ayah was revealed about taking `Isa and his mother as gods besides Allah, thus making Allah the third in a trinity. As-Suddi said, "This is similar to Allah's statement towards the end of the Surah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ŞóÇáó Çááøóåõ íÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäó ãóÑúíóãó ÃóÁóäÊó ŞõáÊó áöáäøóÇÓö ÇÊøóÎöĞõæäöì æóÃõãøöìó ÅöáóÜåóíúäö ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ŞóÇáó ÓõÈúÍóÜäóßó</div><br>  (And (remember) when Allah will say: "O `Isa, son of Maryam!
