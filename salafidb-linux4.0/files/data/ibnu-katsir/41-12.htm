He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóÁöäøóßõãú áóÊóßúİõÑõæäó ÈöÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó ÇáÇøñÑúÖó İöì íóæúãóíúäö æóÊóÌúÚóáõæäó áóåõ ÃóäÏóÇÏÇğ</div><br>  (Say: "Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days And you set up rivals with Him'') meaning, `false gods whom you worship alongside Him'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÑóÈøõ ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (That is the Lord of the that exists.) the Creator of all things is the Lord of all the creatures.

Allah says that He created the earth first, because it is the foundation, and the foundation should be built first, then the roof. Allah says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó áóßõã ãøóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÌóãöíÚÇğ Ëõãøó ÇÓúÊóæóì Åöáóì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö İóÓóæøóÇåõäøó ÓóÈúÚó ÓóãóÜæóÇÊò</div><br>  (He it is Who created for you all that is on the earth.

And the mountains He has fixed firmly, (to be) a provision and benefit for you and your cattle.) (79:27-33) This Ayah states that the spreading out of the earth came after the creation of the heavens, but the earth itself was created before the heavens according to some texts. This was the response of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, as recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Tafsir of this Ayah in his Sahih. He recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said: "A man said to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying: `I find some things in the Qur'an which confuse me:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÃóäÓóÜÈó Èóíúäóåõãú íóæúãóÆöĞò æóáÇó íóÊóÓóÂÁóáõæäó</div><br>  (There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) (23:101),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóŞúÈóáó ÈóÚúÖõåõãú Úóáóì ÈóÚúÖò íóÊóÓóÂÁóáõæäó </div><br>  (And they will turn to one another and question one another) (37:27),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóßúÊõãõæäó Çááøóåó ÍóÏöíËÇğ</div><br>  (but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah) (4:42),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåö ÑóÈøöäóÇ ãóÇ ßõäøóÇ ãõÔúÑößöíäó</div><br>  (By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah) (6:23) But in this Ayah they did hide something.

Here He mentioned the creation of the earth before the creation of the heavens.

It is as if He was and is no longer.' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, replied:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÃóäÓóÜÈó Èóíúäóåõãú íóæúãóÆöĞò æóáÇó íóÊóÓóÂÁóáõæäó</div><br>  (There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) (23:101), this will happen when the Trumpet is blown for the first time.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÕóÚöŞó ãóä İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóãóä İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöáÇøó ãóä ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (And all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allah wills) (39:68), and at that time there will be no kinship among them, nor will they ask of one another.

Allah created the earth in two days, then He created the heavens, then He (Istawa ila) the heaven and gave it its shape in two more days. Then He spread the earth, which means that He brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And He created the mountains, sands, inanimate things, rocks and hills and everything in between, in two more days. This is what Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏóÍóÜåóÇ</div><br>  ((He) spread (the earth)) (79:30) And Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóáóŞó ÇáÇøñÑúÖó İöì íóæúãóíúäö</div><br>  ((He) created the earth in two Days) So He created the earth and everything in it in four days, and He created the heavens in two days.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑÇğ ÑøóÍöíãÇğ</div><br>  (verily, Allah (Kana) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful) (4:23). This is how He described Himself, and this is how He still is. Whatever Allah wills comes to pass, so do not be confused about the Qur'an, for all of it comes from Allah.'''
