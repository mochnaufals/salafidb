He remained leaning on his stick, which was his staff, as Ibn `Abbas may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others said. He stayed like that for a long time, nearly a year. When a creature of the earth, which was a kind of worm, ate through the stick, it became weak and fell to the ground. Then it became apparent that he had died a long time before. It also became clear to Jinn and men alike that the Jinn do not know the Unseen as they (the Jinn) used to imagine and tried to deceive people. This is what Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ Ïóáøóåõãú Úóáóì ãóæúÊöåö ÅöáÇøó ÏóÇÈøóÉõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÊóÃúßõáõ ãöäÓóÃóÊóåõ İóáóãøóÇ ÎóÑøó ÊóÈóíøóäóÊö ÇáúÌöäøõ Ãóä áøóæú ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúáóãõæäó ÇáúÛóíúÈó ãóÇ áóÈöËõæÇú İöì ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö Çáúãõåöíäö</div><br>  (nothing informed them (Jinn) of his death except a little worm of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his stick.
