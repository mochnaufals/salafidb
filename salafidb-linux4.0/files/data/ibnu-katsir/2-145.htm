In another instance, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÍóŞøóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó - æóáóæú ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ßõáøõ ÁÇíóÉò ÍóÊøóì íóÑóæõÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáÇøñáöíãó </div><br>  (Truly, those, against whom the Word (wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment.) (10:96, 97)  This is why Allah said here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöäú ÃóÊóíúÊó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó Èößõáøö ÁóÇíóÉò ãøóÇ ÊóÈöÚõæÇú ŞöÈúáóÊóßó</div><br>  (And even if you were to bring to the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) all the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they would not follow your Qiblah (prayer direction)).  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóäÊó ÈöÊóÇÈöÚò ŞöÈúáóÊóåõãú</div><br>  (...nor are you going to follow their Qiblah ), indicates the vigor with which Allah's Messenger implements what Allah commanded him. Allah's statement also indicates that as much as the Jews adhere to their opinions and desires, the Prophet adheres by Allah's commands, obeying Him and following what pleases Him, and that he would never adhere to their desires in any case. Hence, praying towards Bayt Al-Maqdis was not because it was the Qiblah of the Jews, but because Allah had commanded it. Allah then warns those who knowingly defy the truth, because the proof against those who know is stronger than against other people. This is why Allah said to His Messenger and his Ummah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöäö ÇÊøóÈóÚúÊó ÃóåúæóÂÁóåõã ãøöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌóÂÁóßó ãöäó ÇáúÚöáúãö Åöäøóßó ÅöĞóÇ áøóãöäó ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, if you follow their desires after that which you have received of knowledge (from Allah), then indeed you will be one of the wrongdoers.)  </div></body></html>
