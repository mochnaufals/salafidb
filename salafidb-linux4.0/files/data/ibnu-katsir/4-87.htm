There are many Hadiths that encourage Jihad. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú Âãóäó ÈöÇááåö æóÑóÓõæáöåö¡ æóÃóŞóÇãó ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó¡ æóÂÊóì ÇáÒøóßóÇÉó¡ æóÕóÇãó ÑóãóÖóÇäó¡ ßóÇäó ÍóŞøğÇ Úóáóì Çááåö Ãóäú íõÏúÎöáóåõ ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉó¡ åóÇÌóÑó İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö Ãóæú ÌóáóÓó İöí ÃóÑúÖöåö ÇáøóÊöí æõáöÏó İöíåóÇ»</div><br>  (Whoever believes in Allah and His Messenger, offers prayer, pays the Zakah and fasts the month of Ramadan, will rightfully be granted Paradise by Allah, no matter whether he migrates in Allah's cause or remains in the land where he is born.) The people said, `O Allah's Messenger!

So, when you ask Allah, ask for Al-Firdaws, which is the best and highest part of Paradise, above it is the Throne of the Most Beneficent (Allah) and from it originate the rivers of Paradise.) There are various narrations for this Hadith from `Ubadah, Mu`adh, and Abu Ad-Darda'. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÃóÈóÇ ÓóÚöíÏò ãóäú ÑóÖöíó ÈöÇááåö ÑóÈøğÇ¡ æóÈöÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãö ÏöíäğÇ¡ æóÈöãõÍóãøóÏòÕáì Çááå Úáíå æÓáøã äóÈöíøğÇ¡ æóÌóÈóÊú áóåõ ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉ»</div><br>  (O Abu Sa`id! Whoever accepts Allah as his Lord, Islam as his religion and Muhammad as the Prophet, then he would rightfully acquire Paradise.) Abu Sa`id liked these words and said, "O Allah's Messenger! Repeat them for me.'' The Prophet repeated his words, then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÃõÎúÑóì íóÑúİóÚõ Çááåõ ÇáúÚóÈúÏóÈöåóÇ ãöÇÆóÉó ÏóÑóÌóÉò İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉö¡ ãóÇ Èóíúäó ßõáøö ÏóÑóÌóÊóíúäö ßóãóÇ Èóíúäó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖ»</div><br>  (And (there is) another deed for which Allah raises the servant a hundred grades in Paradise, between each two grades is the distance between heaven and Earth.)

Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÃóÔóÏøõ ÈóÃúÓÇğ æóÃóÔóÏøõ ÊóäßöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And Allah is Stronger in might and Stronger in punishing.) means, He is able over them in this life and the Hereafter, just as He said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó æóáóæú íóÔóÂÁõ Çááøóåõ áÇóäúÊóÕóÑó ãöäúåõãú æóáóÜßöä áøöíóÈúáõæó ÈóÚúÖóßõãú ÈöÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (But if it had been Allah's will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others) (47:4). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Interceding for a Good or an Evil Cause</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóä íóÔúİóÚú ÔóİóÜÚóÉğ ÍóÓóäóÉğ íóßõäú áøóåõ äóÕöíÈñ ãøöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (Whosoever intercedes for a good cause, will have the reward thereof;) meaning, whoever intercedes in a matter that produces good results, will acquire a share in that good.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÔúİóÚú ÔóİóÜÚóÉğ ÓóíøöÆóÉğ íóßõäú áøóåõ ßöİúáñ ãøóäúåóÇ</div><br>  (And whosoever intercedes for an evil cause, will have a share in its burden.) meaning, he will carry a burden due to what resulted from his intercession and intention. For instance, it is recorded in the Sahih that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÔúİóÚõæÇ ÊõÄúÌóÑõæÇ¡ æóíóŞúÖöí Çááåõ Úóáì áöÓóÇäö äóÈöíøöåö ãóÇ ÔóÇÁ»</div><br>  (Intercede and you will gain a reward of it. Yet, Allah shall decide whatever He wills by the words of His Prophet.) Mujahid bin Jabr said, "This Ayah was revealed about the intercession of people on behalf of each other.'' Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ãøõŞöíÊÇğ</div><br>  (And Allah is Ever Muqit over everything.) Ibn `Abbas, `Ata', `Atiyah, Qatadah and Matar Al-Warraq said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõŞöíÊÇğ</div><br>  (Muqit) means, "Watcher.'' Mujahid said that Muqit means, `Witness', and in another narration, `Able to do.' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Returning the Salam, With a Better Salam</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÍõíøöíÊõã ÈöÊóÍöíøóÉò İóÍóíøõæÇú ÈöÃóÍúÓóäó ãöäúåóÂ Ãóæú ÑõÏøõæåóÂ</div><br>  (When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally.) meaning, if the Muslim greets you with the Salam, then return the greeting with a better Salam, or at least equal to the Salam that was given. Therefore, the better Salam is recommended, while returning it equally is an obligation. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Raja' Al-`Utaridi said that `Imran bin Husayn said that a man came to the Messenger of Allah and said, "As-Salamu `Alaykum''. The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, "Ten.'' Another man came and said, "As-Salamu `Alaykum wa Rahmatullah, O Allah's Messenger.'' The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, "Twenty.'' Then another man came and said, "As-Salamu `Alaykum wa Rahmatullah wa Barakatuh.'' The Prophet returned the greeting, and after the man sat down he said, "Thirty.'' This is the narration recorded by Abu Dawud. At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Al-Bazzar also recorded it. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Gharib''. There are several other Hadiths on this subject from Abu Sa`id, `Ali, and Sahl bin Hanif. When the Muslim is greeted with the full form of Salam, he is obliged to return the greeting equally. As for Ahl Adh-Dhimmah the Salam should not be initiated nor should the greeting be added to when returning their greeting. Rather, as recorded in the Two Sahihs their greeting is returned to them equally. Ibn `Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ Óóáøóãó Úóáóíúßõãõ ÇáúíóåõæÏõ¡ İóÅöäøóãóÇ íóŞõæáõ ÃóÍóÏõåõãú: ÇáÓøóÇãõ Úóáóíúßó¡ İóŞõáú: æóÚóáóíúß»</div><br>  (When the Jews greet you, one of them would say, `As-Samu `Alayka (death be unto you).' Therefore, say, `Wa `Alayka (and the same to you).') In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÈúÏóÃõæÇ ÇáúíóåõæÏó æóÇáäøóÕóÇÑóì ÈöÇáÓøóáóÇãö¡ æóÅöĞóÇ áóŞöíÊõãõæåõãú İöí ØóÑöíŞò İóÇÖúØóÑøõæåõãú Åöáì ÃóÖúíóŞöå»</div><br>  (Do not initiate greeting the Jews and Christians with the Salam, and when you pass by them on a road, force them to its narrowest path.) Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö¡ áóÇ ÊóÏúÎõáõæÇ ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉó ÍóÊøóì ÊõÄúãöäõæÇ¡ æóáóÇ ÊõÄúãöäõæÇ ÍóÊøóì ÊóÍóÇÈøõæÇ¡ ÃóİóáóÇ ÃóÏõáøõßõãú Úóáóì ÃóãúÑò ÅöĞóÇ İóÚóáúÊõãõæåõ ÊóÍóÇÈóÈúÊõãú¿ ÃóİúÔõæÇ ÇáÓøóáóÇãó Èóíúäóßõã»</div><br>  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love each other. Should I direct you to an action that would direct you to love each other Spread the Salam among yourselves.) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó</div><br>  (Allah! none has the right to be worshipped but He) informing that He is singled out as the sole God of all creation.

Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäú ÃóÕúÏóŞõ ãöäó Çááøóåö ÍóÏöíËÇğ</div><br>  (And who is truer in statement than Allah) meaning, no one utters more truthful statements than Allah, in His promise, warning, stories of the past and information of what is to come; there is no deity worthy of worship nor Lord except Him.  </div></body></html>
