(7. And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed: "If you give thanks, I will give you more; but if you are thankless, verily, My punishment is indeed severe.'') (8.

Allah delivered them from all this torment, and this is a great bounty, indeed.

Some scholars said that this part of the Ayah means, `what Fir`awn used to do to you was a tremendous   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóáÇóÁğ</div><br>  (trial.)' Both meanings might be considered here and Allah knows best. Allah said in another Ayah ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóáóæúäóÜåõãú ÈöÇáúÍóÓóäóÜÊö æóÇáÓøóíøöÆóÇÊö áóÚóáøóåõãú íóÑúÌöÚõæäó</div><br>  (And We tried them with good and evil in order that they might turn (to Allah). ) 7:168 Allah's statement next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ÊóÃóĞøóäó ÑóÈøõßõãú</div><br>  (And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed) means, proclaimed and made known His promise to you. It is possible that this Ayah means, your Lord has vowed and sworn by His might, grace and exaltness. Allah said in a similar Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ÊóÃóĞøóäó ÑóÈøõßó áóíóÈúÚóËóäøó Úóáóíúåöãú Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö</div><br>  (And (remember) when your Lord declared that He would certainly keep on sending against them (i.e. the Jews), till the Day of Resurrection.) 7:167 Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÆöä ÔóßóÑúÊõãú áÃóÒöíÏóäøóßõãú</div><br>  (If you give thanks, I will give you more;) meaning, `if you appreciate My favor on you, I will give you more of it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöä ßóİóÑúÊõãú</div><br>  (but if you are thankless) if you are not thankful for My favors, covering and denying, them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÚóĞóÇÈöì áóÔóÏöíÏñ</div><br>  (verily, My punishment is indeed severe), by depriving you of the favor and punishing you for being unappreciative of it.'

Allah does not need the gratitude of His servants, and He is worthy of all praise even if the disbelievers disbelieve in Him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊóßúİõÑõæÇú İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó Ûóäöìøñ Úóäßõãú</div><br>  (If you disbelieve, then verily, Allah is not in need of you) 39:7 and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóİóÑõæÇú æóÊóæóáøóæÇú æøóÇÓúÊóÛúäóì Çááøóåõ æóÇááøóåõ Ûóäöìøñ ÍóãöíÏñ</div><br>  (So they disbelieved and turned away.
