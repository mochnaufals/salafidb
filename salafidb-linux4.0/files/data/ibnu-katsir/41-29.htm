This was the view of Mujahid. "And make noise in the midst of its (recitation)'' means whistling and trying to make the Messenger of Allah confused when he recited Qur'an, which is what the Quraysh did.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÛúáöÈõæäó</div><br>  (that you may overcome.) means, this is the practice of these ignorant disbelievers and those who follow in their footsteps, when they hear the Qur'an.

It was reported that `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said, concerning the phrase,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇááøóĞóíúäö ÃóÖóáøóÜäóÇ</div><br>  (those who led us astray): "Iblis and the son of Adam who killed his brother.'' As-Suddi reported that `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said; "Iblis is followed by everyone who commits Shirk and the son of Adam is followed by everyone who commits a major sin. So Iblis is the one who calls people to every evil thing, such as Shirk and lesser sins.'' As for the first son of Adam, it is as confirmed in the Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ŞõÊöáóÊú äóİúÓñ ÙõáúãğÇ ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇäó Úóáóì ÇÈúäö ÂÏóãó ÇáúÃóæøóáö ßöİúáñ ãöäú ÏóãöåóÇ¡áöÃóäøóåõ Ãóæøóáõ ãóäú Óóäøó ÇáúŞóÊúá»</div><br>  (No soul is wrongfully killed, but a share of the burden of that sin will be upon the first son of Adam, because he was the first one who set the precedent of killing another.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÌúÚóáúåõãóÇ ÊóÍúÊó ÃóŞúÏóÇãöäóÇ</div><br>  (that we may crush them under our feet) means, `make them beneath us in the torment, so that they will be punished more severely than us.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíóßõæäóÇ ãöäó ÇáÇøñÓúİóáöíäó</div><br>  (so that they become the lowest.) means, in the lowest level of Hell, as already mentioned in Al-A`raf, where the followers ask Allah to multiply the torment for their leaders:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó áößõáøò ÖöÚúİñ æóáóÜßöä áÇøó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  ((Allah) said: "For each one there is double (torment), but you know not.'') (7:38) i.e., Allah will give each of them the torment and punishment they deserve for their deeds. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóÕóÏøõæÇú Úóä ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö ÒöÏúäóÜåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈğÇ İóæúŞó ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íõİúÓöÏõæäó </div><br>  (Those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, for them We will add torment to the torment because they used to spread corruption.)
