Imam Ahmad reported that Anas bin Malik said, "Abu Talhah had more property than any other among the Ansar in Al-Madinah, and the most beloved of his property to him was Bayruha' garden, which was in front of the (Messenger's) Masjid. Sometimes, Allah's Messenger used to go to the garden and drink its fresh water.'' Anas added, "When these verses were revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä ÊóäóÇáõæÇú ÇáúÈöÑøó ÍóÊøóì ÊõäİöŞõæÇú ãöãøóÇ ÊõÍöÈøõæäó</div><br>  (By no means shall you attain Al-Birr unless You spend of that which you love,)  Abu Talhah said, `O Allah's Messenger! Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä ÊóäóÇáõæÇú ÇáúÈöÑøó ÍóÊøóì ÊõäİöŞõæÇú ãöãøóÇ ÊõÍöÈøõæäó</div><br>  (By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend of that which you love;) No doubt, Bayruha' garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in charity in Allah's cause, and I expect its reward and compensation from Allah. O Allah's Messenger! Spend it where Allah makes you think is feasible. ' On that, Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈóÎò ÈóÎò¡ ĞóÇßó ãóÇáñ ÑóÇÈöÍñ¡ ĞóÇßó ãóÇáñ ÑóÇÈöÍñ¡ æóŞóÏú ÓóãöÚúÊõ¡ æóÃóäóÇ ÃóÑóì Ãóäú ÊóÌúÚóáóåóÇ İöí ÇáúÃóŞúÑóÈöíä»</div><br>  (Well-done! It is profitable property, it is profitable property. I have heard what you have said, and I think it would be proper if you gave it to your kith and kin.)  Abu Talhah said, `I will do so, O Allah's Messenger.' Then Abu Talhah distributed that garden among his relatives and cousins.''  This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. They also recorded that `Umar said, "O Messenger of Allah! I never gained possession of a piece of property more precious to me than my share in Khaybar. Therefore, what do you command me to do with it'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÍóÈøöÓö ÇáúÃóÕúáó æóÓóÈøöáö ÇáËøóãóÑóÉ»</div><br>  (Retain the land to give its fruits in Allah's cause.)  </div></body></html>
