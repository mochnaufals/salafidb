However, it was as if one of them felt something in himself (against my attending). So he said, `Why do you (`Umar) bring this (youth) to sit with us when we have children like him (i.e., his age)' So `Umar replied, `Verily, he is among those whom you know. Then one day he called them and invited me to sit with them, and I do not think that he invited me to be among them that day except to show them. So he said, `What do you say about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁó äóÕúÑõ Çááøóåö æóÇáúİóÊúÍõ </div><br>  (When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest.)' Some of them said, `We were commanded to praise Allah and seek His forgiveness when He helps us and gives us victory.' Some of them remained silent and did not say anything. Then he (`Umar) said to me, `Is this what you say, O Ibn `Abbas' I said, `No.' He then said, `What do you say' I said, `It was the end of the life of Allah's Messenger that Allah was informing him of. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁó äóÕúÑõ Çááøóåö æóÇáúİóÊúÍõ </div><br>  (When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest.) which means, that is a sign of the end of your life.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÍóãúÏö ÑóÈøößó æóÇÓúÊóÛúİöÑúåõ Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÊóæöÈóÇ </div><br>  (So, glorify the praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.)' So, `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, `I do not know anything about it other than what you have said.''' Al-Bukhari was alone in recording this Hadith.  Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "When   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁó äóÕúÑõ Çááøóåö æóÇáúİóÊúÍõ </div><br>  (When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest.) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äõÚöíóÊú Åöáóíøó äóİúÓöí»</div><br>  (My death has been announced to me.) And indeed he died during that year.'' Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith.  Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah said, "The Messenger of Allah used to say often in his bowing and prostrating,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓõÈúÍóÇäóßó Çááøóåõãøó ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÈöÍóãúÏößó Çááøóåõãøó ÇÛúİöÑú áöí»</div><br>  (Glory to You, O Allah, our Lord, and praise be to You. O Allah, forgive me.) He did this as his interpretation of the Qur'an (i.e., showing its implementation).'' The rest of the group has also recorded this Hadith except for At-Tirmidhi.  Imam Ahmad recorded from Masruq that `A'ishah said, "The Messenger of Allah used to often say towards the end of his life,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓõÈúÍóÇäó Çááåö æóÈöÍóãúÏöåö¡ ÃóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõ Çááåó æóÃóÊõæÈõ Åöáóíúå»</div><br>  (Glory to Allah, and praise be unto Him. I seek Allah's forgiveness and I repent to Him.) And he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÑóÈøöí ßóÇäó ÃóÎúÈóÑóäöí Ãóäøöí ÓóÃóÑóì ÚóáóÇãóÉğ İöí ÃõãøóÊöí¡ æóÃóãóÑóäöí ÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóíúÊõåóÇ Ãóäú ÃõÓóÈøöÍó ÈöÍóãúÏöåö æóÃóÓúÊóÛúİöÑóåõ¡ Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÊóæøóÇÈğÇ¡ İóŞóÏú ÑóÃóíúÊõåóÇ:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁó äóÕúÑõ Çááøóåö æóÇáúİóÊúÍõ - æóÑóÃóíúÊó ÇáäøóÇÓó íóÏúÎõáõæäó İöì Ïöíäö Çááøóåö ÃóİúæóÌÇğ - İóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÍóãúÏö ÑóÈøößó æóÇÓúÊóÛúİöÑúåõ Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÊóæöÈóÇ »</div><br>  (Verily, my Lord has informed me that I will see a sign in my Ummah and He has commanded me that when I see it, I should glorify His praises and seek His forgiveness, for He is the One Who accepts repentance. And indeed I have seen it (i.e., the sign). (When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest (Al-Fath). And you see that the people enter Allah's religion in crowds. So glorify the praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.))'' Muslim also recorded this Hadith. The meaning of Al-Fath here is the conquest of Makkah, and there is only one view concerning it. For indeed the different areas of the Arabs were waiting for the conquest of Makkah before they would accept Islam. They said, "If he (Muhammad is victorious over his people, then he is a (true) Prophet.'' So when Allah gave him victory over Makkah, they entered into the religion of Allah (Islam) in crowds. Thus, two years did not pass (after the conquest of Makkah) before the peninsula of the Arabs was laden with faith. And there did not remain any of the tribes of the Arabs except that they professed (their acceptance) of Islam. And all praise and blessings are due to Allah. Al-Bukhari recorded in his Sahih that `Amr bin Salamah said, "When Makkah was conquered, all of the people rushed to the Messenger of Allah to profess their Islam. The various regions were delaying their acceptance of Islam until Makkah was conquered. The people used to say, `Leave him and his people alone. If he is victorious over them he is a (true) Prophet.'''  We have researched the war expedition for conquest of Makkah in our book As-Surah. Therefore, whoever wishes he may review it there. And all praise and blessings are due to Allah.Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu `Ammar that a neighbor of Jabir bin `Abdullah told him, "I returned from a journey and Jabir bin `Abdullah came and greeted me. So I began to talk with him about the divisions among the people and what they had started doing. Thus, Jabir began to cry and he said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáäøóÇÓó ÏóÎóáõæÇ İöí Ïöíäö Çááåö ÃóİúæóÇÌğÇ¡ æóÓóíóÎúÑõÌõæäó ãöäúåõ ÃóİúæóÇÌğÇ»</div><br>  (Verily, the people have entered into the religion of Allah in crowds and they will also leave it in crowds.)''  This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat An-Nasr, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
