We have already seen their stories in detail in numerous places (in the Qur'an). Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÇáÇøñÍúÒóÇÈõ</div><br>  (such were the Confederates.) meaning, `they were greater and stronger than you, they had more wealth and children, but that did not protect them from the punishment of Allah at all when the command of your Lord came to pass.' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ßõáøñ ÅöáÇøó ßóĞøóÈó ÇáÑøñÓõáó İóÍóŞøó ÚöŞóÇÈö </div><br>  (Not one of them but denied the Messengers; therefore My torment was justified.) `The reason for their destruction was their disbelief in the Messengers, so let those who are addressed here beware and be afraid.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóäÙõÑõ åóÜÄõáÂÁö ÅöáÇøó ÕóíúÍóÉğ æÍöÏóÉğ ãøóÇ áóåóÇ ãöä İóæóÇŞò </div><br>  (And these only wait for a single Sayhah there will be no pause or ending thereto.) Malik narrated from Zayd bin Aslam; "There will none who can avert it,'' i.e., they will only wait for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not. But some of its portents have already come, i.e., it has drawn nigh. This Sayhah is the blast on the Trumpet when Allah will command Israfil to sound a long note, and there will be no one in the heaven or on earth but will be terrified, except those whom Allah spares.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú ÑóÈøóäóÇ ÚóÌøöá áøóäóÇ ŞöØøóäóÇ ŞóÈúáó íóæúãö ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈö </div><br>  (They say: "Our Lord! Hasten to us Qittana before the Day of Reckoning!'') Here Allah denounces the idolators for calling for the punishment to be hastened upon themselves. Qitt refers to a book or record, or it was said that it means one's allotted share or fortune. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said, "They asked for the punishment to be hastened.'' Qatadah added, this is like when they said: e   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõãøó Åöä ßóÇäó åóÜĞóÇ åõæó ÇáúÍóŞøó ãöäú ÚöäÏößó İóÃóãúØöÑú ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÍöÌóÇÑóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö Ãóæö ÇÆúÊöäóÇ ÈöÚóĞóÇÈò Ãóáöíãò</div><br>  ("O Allah! If this (the Qur'an) is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.'') (8:32). It was also said that they asked for their share of Paradise to be hastened, if it really existed, so that they might have their share in this world; they said this because they thought it unlikely to exist and they disbelieved in it. Ibn Jarir said, "They asked for whatever they deserved, good or bad, to be hastened for them in this world.'' What he said is good, and A-Dahhak and Isma`il bin Abi Khalid based their views on it. And Allah knows best. They said this by way of mockery and disbelief, so Allah commanded His Messenger to be patient in the face of their insults, and He gave him the glad tidings that his patience would be rewarded with victory and success.  </div></body></html>
