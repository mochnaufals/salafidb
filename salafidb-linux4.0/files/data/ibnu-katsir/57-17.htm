An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith in the Tafsir of this Ayah. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóßõæäõæÇú ßóÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ãöä ŞóÈúáõ İóØóÇáó Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáÇøñãóÏõ İóŞóÓóÊú ŞõáõæÈõåõãú</div><br>  (Lest they become as those who received the Scripture before, and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened) Allah is prohibiting the believers from imitating those who were given the Scriptures before them, the Jews and Christians. As time passed, they changed the Book of Allah that they had, and sold it for a small, miserable price. They also abandoned Allah's Book behind their back and were impressed and consumed by various opinions and false creeds. They imitated the way others behaved with the religion of Allah, making their rabbis and priests into gods beside Allah. Consequently, their hearts became hard and they would not accept advice; their hearts did not feel humbled by Allah's promises or threats,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóËöíÑñ ãøöäúåõãú İóÜÓöŞõæäó</div><br>  (And many of them were rebellious.) meaning, in action; therefore, their hearts are corrupt and their actions are invalid, just as Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöãóÇ äóŞúÖöåöã ãøöíËóÜŞóåõãú áóÚäøóÜåõãú æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ŞõáõæÈóåõãú ŞóÇÓöíóÉğ íõÍóÑøöİõæäó Çáúßóáöãó Úóä ãøóæóÖöÚöåö æóäóÓõæÇú ÍóÙøóÇ ãøöãøóÇ ĞõßöÑõæÇú Èöåö</div><br>  (So, because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard. They changed the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them.)(5:13) meaning, their hearts became corrupt and they hardened, and they acquired the behavior of changing Allah's Speech from their appropriate places and meanings. They abandoned acts of worship that they were commanded to perform and committed what they were prohibited to do. This is why Allah forbade the believers from imitating them in any way, be it basic or detailed matters. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÚúáóãõæÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó íõÍúìö ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ÈóÚúÏó ãóæúÊöåóÇ ŞóÏú ÈóíøóäøóÇ áóßõãõ ÇáÇøñíóÜÊö áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÚúŞöáõæäó </div><br>  (Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death! Indeed We have made clear the Ayat to you, if you but understand.) This Ayah indicates that He brings subtleness to hearts after they have become hard, guides the confused after they were led astray, and relieves hardships after they have intensified. And just as Allah brings life back to the dead and dry earth by sending the needed abundant rain, He also guides the hardened hearts with the proofs and evidences of the Qur'an. The light (of faith) would have access to the hearts once again, after they were closed and, as a consequence, no guidance was able to reach them. All praise is due to Him Who guides whomever He wills after they were misguided, Who misguides those who were led aright before. Surely, it is He Who does what He wills and He is the All-Wise, the Most Just in all that He does, the Most Subtle, the Most Aware, the Most High, the Proud.  </div></body></html>
