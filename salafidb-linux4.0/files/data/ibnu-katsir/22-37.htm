Nothing of its flesh or blood reaches Him, for He has no need of anything other than Himself.  During the time of Jahiliyyah, when they offered sacrifices to their gods, they would put some of the meat of their sacrifices on their idols, and sprinkle the blood over them. But Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä íóäóÇáó Çááøóåó áõÍõæãõåóÇ æóáÇó ÏöãóÂÄõåóÇ</div><br>  (It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Jurayj said, "The people of the Jahiliyyah used to put the meat of their sacrifices and sprinkle the blood on the House, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, "We have more right to do that.'' Then Allah revealed the words:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä íóäóÇáó Çááøóåó áõÍõæãõåóÇ æóáÇó ÏöãóÂÄõåóÇ æóáóÜßöä íóäóÇáõåõ ÇáÊøóŞúæóì ãöäßõãú</div><br>  (It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is Taqwa from you that reaches Him.) That is what He will accept and reward for, as mentioned in the Sahih,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó áóÇ íóäúÙõÑõ Åöáóì ÕõæóÑößõãú æóáóÇ Åöáóì ÃóáúæóÇäößõãú¡ æóáóßöäú íóäúÙõÑõ Åöáóì ŞõáõæÈößõãú æóÃóÚúãóÇáößõã»</div><br>  (Allah does not look to your appearance or your colors, but He looks to your hearts and deeds.) And in the Hadith; (Indeed charity falls in the Hand of Ar-Rahman before it falls in the hand of the one asking.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó ÓóÎøóÑóåóÇ áóßõãú</div><br>  (Thus have We made them subject to you) meaning, `for this purpose We have subjugated the Budn for you,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöÊõßóÈøöÑõæÇú Çááøóåó Úóáóì ãóÇ åóÏóÇßõãú</div><br>  (that you may proclaim Allah's greatness for His guidance to you.) means, that you may glorify Him for guiding you to His religion and His way which He loves and is pleased with, and has forbidden you to do all that He hates and rejects.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóÔøöÑö ÇáúãõÍúÓöäöíäó</div><br>  (And give glad tidings to the doers of good.) means, `give good news, O Muhammad, to those who do good,' i.e., whose deeds are good and who remain within the limits prescribed by Allah, who follow that which has been prescribed for them, who believe in the Messenger and follow that which he has conveyed from his Lord.  (Note) The Udhiyyah is Sunnah Mustahabbah One animal is sufficient on behalf of all the members of one household. Ibn `Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah continued to offer sacrifice for ten years.'' This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. Abu Ayyub said: "At the time of the Messenger of Allah , a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and all the members of his household, and they would eat from it and feed others, until the people started boasting by sacrificing more than one and things reached the stage that you see now.'' This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by Ibn Majah. `Abdullah bin Hisham used to sacrifice one sheep on behalf of his entire family; this was recorded by Al-Bukhari.  Concerning how old the sacrificial animal should be, Muslim recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóĞúÈóÍõæÇ ÅöáøóÇ ãõÓöäøóÉğ¡ ÅöáøóÇ Ãóäú ÊóÚúÓõÑó Úóáóíúßõãú İóÊóĞúÈóÍõæÇ ÌóĞóÚóÉğ ãöäó ÇáÖøóÃúä»</div><br>  (Do not sacrifice any but mature animals, and if that is not possible, then sacrifice a young sheep.)  </div></body></html>
