And remember Allah during the Appointed Days.

Imam Ahmad reported that `Uqbah bin `Amr said that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóæúãõ ÚóÑóİóÉó¡ æóíóæúãõ ÇáäøóÍúÑö¡ æóÃóíøóÇãõ ÇáÊøóÔúÑöíŞö¡ ÚöíÏõäóÇ Ãóåúáó ÇáúÅÓúáóÇãö¡ æóåöíó ÃóíøóÇãõ Ãóßúáò æóÔõÑúÈ»</div><br>  (The day of `Arafah (9th of Dhul-Hijjah), the day of the Sacrifice (10th) and the days of the Tashriq (11-12-13th) are our `Id (festival) for we people of Islam. These are days of eating and drinking.)  Imam Ahmad reported that Nubayshah Al-Hudhali said that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóíøóÇãõ ÇáÊøóÔúÑöíŞö ÃóíøóÇãõ Ãóßúáò æÔõÑúÈò æóĞößúÑö Çááå»</div><br>  (The days of Tashriq are days of eating, drinking and Dhikr (remembering) of Allah.)  Muslim also recorded this Haith  We also mentioned the Hadith of Jubayr bin Mut`im:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÚóÑóİóÉõ ßõáøõåóÇ ãóæúŞöİñ¡ æóÃíøóÇãõ ÇáÊøóÔúÑöíŞö ßõáøõåóÇ ĞóÈúÍ»</div><br>  (All of `Arafat is a standing place and all of the days of Tashriq are days of Sacrifice. )  We also mentioned the Hadith by `Abdur-Rahman bin Ya`mar Ad-Diyli:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÃóíøóÇãõ ãöäìğ ËóáóÇËóÉñ İóãóäú ÊóÚóÌøóáó İöí íóæúãóíúäö İóáóÇ ÅËúãó Úóáóíúåö æóãóäú ÊóÃóÎøóÑó İóáóÇ ÅöËúãó Úóáóíúå»</div><br>  (The days of Mina (Tashriq) are three. Those who hasten in two days then there is no sin in it, and those who delay (i.e., remain in Mina for a third day) then there is no sin in it.)  Ibn Jarir reported that Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóíøóÇãõ ÇáÊøóÔúÑöíŞö ÃíøóÇãõ ØõÚúãò æóĞößúÑö Çááå»</div><br>  (The days of Tashriq are days of eating and remembering Allah.)  Ibn Jarir reported that Abu Hurayrah narrated that Allah's Messenger sent `Abdullah bin Hudhafah to Mina proclaiming:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÕõæãõæÇ åĞöå ÇáúÃóíøóÇãó¡ İóÅäøóåóÇ ÃóíøóÇãõ Ãóßúáò æóÔõÑúÈò æóĞößúÑö Çááåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóá»</div><br>  (Do not fast these days (i.e., Tashriq days), for they are days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah the Exalted and Most Honored.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Appointed Days</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Miqsam said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Appointed Days are the days of Tashriq, four days: the day of the Sacrifice (10th of Dhul-Hijjah) and three days after that.  This opinion was also reported of Ibn `Umar, Ibn Az-Zubayr, Abu Musa, `Ata', Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Yahya bin Abu Kathir, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Az-Zuhri, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Malik bin Anas, and others. In addition, the apparent meaning of the following Ayah supports this opinion:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóä ÊóÚóÌøóáó İöì íóæúãóíúäö İóáÇó ÅöËúãó Úóáóíúåö æóãóä ÊóÃóÎøóÑó İóáÇ ÅöËúãó Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him.)  So the Ayah hints to the three days after the day of Sacrifice.  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú Çááøóåó İöì ÃóíøóÇãò ãøóÚúÏõæÏóÊò</div><br>  (And remember Allah during the Appointed Days) directs remembering Allah upon slaughtering the animals, after the prayers, and by Dhikr (supplication) in general. It also includes Takbir and remembering Allah while throwing the pebbles every day during the Tashriq days. A Hadith that Abu Dawud and several others collected states:  ÅöäøóãóÇ ÌõÚöáó ÇáØøóæóÇİõ ÈöÇáúÈóíúÊö æóÇáÓøóÚúíõ Èóíúäó ÇáÕøóİóÇ æóÇáúãóÑúæóÉö æóÑóãúíõ ÇáúÌöãóÇÑö áÅöŞóÇãóÉö ĞößúÑö Çááåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó  (Tawaf around the House, Sa`i between As-Safa and Al-Marwah and throwing the pebbles were legislated so that Allah is remembered in Dhikr.)  When mentioning the first procession (refer to 2:199) and the second procession of the people upon the end of the Hajj season, when they start to return to their areas, after they had gathered during the rituals and at the standing places, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó æóÇÚúáóãõæÇ Ãóäøóßõãú Åöáóíúåö ÊõÍúÔóÑõæäó</div><br>  (and obey Allah (fear Him), and know that you will surely be gathered unto Him.)  Similarly, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì ĞóÑóÃóßõãú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÅöáóíúåö ÊõÍúÔóÑõæäó </div><br>  (And it is He Who has created you on the earth, and to Him you shall be gathered back.)
