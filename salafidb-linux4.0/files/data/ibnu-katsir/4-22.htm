If one of them wants, he would marry her, give her in marriage, or prevent her from marriage, for they had more right to her than her own family. Thereafter, this Ayah was revealed about this practice,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áÇó íóÍöáøõ áóßõãú Ãóä ÊóÑöËõæÇú ÇáäøöÓóÂÁó ßóÑúåÇğ</div><br>  (O you who believe!

Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Muhammad bin Sirin, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Qilabah, Abu Salih, As-Suddi, Zayd bin Aslam and Sa`id bin Abi Hilal said that this refers to illicit sex. Meaning that if the wife commits adultery, you are allowed to take back the dowry you gave her. You are also allowed to annoy her, until she gives back the dowry in return for a Khula`.'' In Surat Al-Baqarah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÍöáøõ áóßõãú Ãóä ÊóÃúÎõĞõæÇú ãöãøóÂ ÁóÇÊóíúÊõãõæåõäøó ÔóíúÆğÇ ÅöáÇøó Ãóä íóÎóÇİóÂ ÃóáÇøó íõŞöíãóÇ ÍõÏõæÏó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of what you have given them, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah) 2:229. Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak said that Fahishah refers to disobedience and defiance. Ibn Jarir chose the view that it is general, encompasses all these meanings, adultery, disobedience, defiance, rudeness, and so forth. Meaning that he is allowed to annoy his wife when she does any of these acts until she forfeits all or part of her rights and he then separates from her, and this view is good, and Allah knows best. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Live With Women Honorably</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóÇÔöÑõæåõäøó ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö</div><br>  (And live with them honorably), by saying kind words to them, treating them kindly and making your appearance appealing for them, as much as you can, just as you like the same from them.

Verily, I am the best one among you with my family.) It was the practice of the Messenger of Allah to be kind, cheerful, playful with his wives, compassionate, spending on them and laughing with them. The Messenger used to race with `A'ishah, the Mother of the Faithful, as a means of kindness to her. `A'ishah said, "The Messenger of Allah raced with me and I won the race. This occurred before I gained weight, and afterwards I raced with him again, and he won that race. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åĞöåö ÈöÊöáúß»</div><br>  (This victory  is for that victory.)'' When the Prophet was at the home of one of his wives, sometimes all of his wives would meet there and eat together, and they would then go back to their homes. He and his wife would sleep in the same bed, he would remove his upper garment, sleeping in only his lower garment. The Prophet used to talk to the wife whose night it was, after praying `Isha' and before he went to sleep.

Allah says that your patience, which is demonstrated by keeping wives whom you dislike, carries good rewards for you in this life and the Hereafter. Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah, "That the husband may feel compassion towards his wife and Allah gives him a child with her, and this child carries tremendous goodness.'' An authentic Hadith states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ íóİúÑóßú ãõÄúãöäñ ãõÄúãöäóÉğ¡ Åöäú ÓóÎöØó ãöäúåóÇ ÎõáõŞğÇ¡ ÑóÖöíó ãöäúåóÇ ÂÎóÑ»</div><br>  (No believing man should hate his believing wife.

We mentioned the meaning of Qintar in the Tafsir of Surah Al `Imran. This Ayah is clear in its indication that the dowry could be substantial. `Umar bin Al-Khattab used to discourage giving a large dowry, but later on changed his view. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Al-`Ajfa' As-Sulami said that he heard `Umar bin Al-Khattab saying, "Do not exaggerate with the dowry of women, had this practice been an honor in this world or a part of Taqwa, then the Prophet would have had more right to practice it than you. The Messenger of Allah never gave any of his wives, nor did any of his daughters receive a dowry more than twelve Uwqiyah. A man used to pay a substantial dowry and thus conceal enmity towards his wife!'' Ahmad and the collectors of Sunan collected this Hadith through various chains of narration, and At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih''. Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la recorded that Masruq said, "`Umar bin Al-Khattab stood up on the Minbar of the Messenger of Allah and said, `O people! Why do you exaggerate concerning the dowry given to women The Messenger of Allah and his Companions used to pay up to four hundred Dirhams for a dowry, or less than that. Had paying more for a dowry been a part of Taqwa or an honor, you would not have led them in this practice. Therefore, I do not want to hear about a man who pays more than four hundred Dirhams for a dowry.' He then went down the Minbar, but a woman from Quraysh said to him, `O Leader of the Faithful! You prohibited people from paying more than four hundred Dirhams in a dowry for women' He said, `Yes.' She said, `Have you not heard what Allah sent down in the Qur'an' He said, `Which part of it' She said, `Have you not heard Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóíúÊõãú ÅöÍúÏóÇåõäøó ŞöäúØóÇÑÇğ</div><br>  (And you have given one of them a Qintar)' He said, `O Allah! Forgive me...' He then went back and stood up on the Minbar saying, `I had prohibited you from paying more than four hundred Dirhams in a dowry for women. So, let everyone pay what he likes from his money.''' The chain of narration for this Hadith is strong.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóíúİó ÊóÃúÎõĞõæäóåõ æóŞóÏú ÃóİúÖóì ÈóÚúÖõßõãú Åöáóì ÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (And how could you take it (back) while you have gone in unto each other) how can you take back the dowry from the woman with whom you had sexual relations and she had sexual relations with you Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, As-Suddi and several others said that this means sexual intercourse. The Two Sahihs record that the Messenger of Allah said three times to the spouses who said the Mula`anah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááåõ íóÚúáóãõ Ãóäøó ÃóÍóÏóßõãóÇ ßóÇĞöÈñ¡ İóåóáú ãöäúßõãóÇ ÊóÇÆöÈñ¿»</div><br>  (Allah knows that one of you is a liar, so would any of you repent ) The man said, "O Messenger of Allah! My money,'' referring to the dowry that he gave his wife. The Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ãóÇáó áóßó¡ Åöäú ßõäúÊó ÕóÏóŞúÊó ÚóáóíúåóÇ İóåõæó ÈöãóÇ ÇÓúÊóÍúáóáúÊó ãöäú İóÑúÌöåóÇ¡ æóÅöäú ßõäúÊó ßóĞóÈúÊó ÚóáóíúåóÇ İóåõæó ÃóÈúÚóÏõ áóßó ãöäúåóÇ»</div><br>  (You have no money. If you are the one who said the truth, the dowry is in return for the right to have sexual intercourse with her. If you are the one who uttered the lie, then this money is even farther from your reach.) Similarly Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóíúİó ÊóÃúÎõĞõæäóåõ æóŞóÏú ÃóİúÖóì ÈóÚúÖõßõãú Åöáóì ÈóÚúÖò æóÃóÎóĞúäó ãöäßõã ãøöíËóÜŞÇğ ÛóáöíÙÇğ </div><br>  (And how could you take it (back) while you have gone in unto each other and they have taken from you a firm and strong covenant) (Be kind with women, for you have taken them by Allah's covenant and earned the right to have sexual relations with them by Allah's Word.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Marrying the Wife of the Father is Prohibited</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóäßöÍõæÇú ãóÇ äóßóÍó ÁóÇÈóÇÄõßõãú ãøöäó ÇáäøöÓóÂÁö</div><br>  (And marry not women whom your fathers married,) Allah prohibits marrying the women whom the father married, in honor and respect to the fathers, not allowing their children to have sexual relations with their wives after they die. A woman becomes ineligible for the son of her husband as soon as the marriage contract is conducted, and there is a consensus on this ruling. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people used to prohibit what Allah prohibits (concerning marriage), except marrying the stepmother and taking two sisters as rival wives. Allah sent down,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóäßöÍõæÇú ãóÇ äóßóÍó ÁóÇÈóÇÄõßõãú ãøöäó ÇáäøöÓóÂÁö</div><br>  (And marry not women whom your fathers married,) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóä ÊóÌúãóÚõæÇú Èóíúäó ÇáÇøòÎúÊóíúäö</div><br>  (and two sisters in wedlock at the same time) 4:23.'' Similar was reported from `Ata' and Qatadah. Therefore, the practice that the Ayah mentions is prohibited for this Ummah, being disgraced as an awful sin, r   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó İóÜÍöÔóÉğ æóãóŞúÊÇğ æóÓóÂÁó ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (Indeed it was shameful and Maqtan, and an evil way.) Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóŞúÑóÈõæÇú ÇáúİóæóÍöÔó ãóÇ ÙóåóÑó ãöäúåóÇ æóãóÇ ÈóØóäó</div><br>  (Come not near to Al-Fawahish (shameful acts) whether committed openly or secretly) 6:151, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóŞúÑóÈõæÇú ÇáÒøöäóì Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó İóÇÍöÔóÉğ æóÓóÂÁó ÓóÈöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fahishah and an evil way.) 17:32 In this Ayah (4:22), Allah added,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóŞúÊÇğ</div><br>  (and Maqtan), meaning, offensive. It is a sin itself and causes the son to hate his father after he marries his wife. It is usual that whoever marries a woman dislikes those who married her before him. This is one reason why the Mothers of the Faithful were not allowed for anyone in marriage after the Messenger . They are indeed the Mothers of the Faithful since they married the Messenger , who is like the father to the believers. Rather, the Prophet's right is far greater than the right of a father, and his love comes before each person loving himself, may Allah's peace and blessings be on him. `Ata' bin Abi Rabah said that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóŞúÊÇğ</div><br>  (and Maqtan), means, Allah will hate him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÂÁó ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (and an evil way), for those who take this way. Therefore, those who commit this practice will have committed an act of reversion from the religion and deserve capital punishment and confiscation of their property, which will be given to the Muslim Treasury. Imam Ahmad and the collectors of Sunan recorded that Al-Bara' bin `Azib said that his uncle Abu Burdah was sent by the Messenger of Allah to a man who married his stepmother to execute him and confiscate his money.  </div></body></html>
