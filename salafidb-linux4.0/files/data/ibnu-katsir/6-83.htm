And that was Our proof which We gave Ibrahim against his people. We in degrees raise whom We will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.)  Allah states that His Khalil, Prophet Ibrahim, said when his people mentioned various doubts and disputed with him about the Tawhid that he called to:</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊõÍóÇÌøõæäøöì İöì Çááøóåö æóŞóÏú åóÏóÇäöì</div><br>  (Do you dispute with me about Allah while He has guided me).

Ibrahim said, among the proofs to the falsehood of your creed, is that these false gods that you worship do not bring about any effect, and I do not fear them or care about them. Therefore, if these gods are able to cause harm, then use them against me and do not give me respite. Ibrahim's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Ãóä íóÔóÂÁó ÑóÈøöì ÔóíúÆÇğ</div><br>  (except when my Lord wills something.) means, only Allah causes benefit or harm.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓöÚó ÑóÈøöì ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò ÚöáúãÇğ</div><br>  (My Lord comprehends in His knowledge all things. ) meaning, Allah's knowledge encompasses all things and nothing escapes His complete observation,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó ÊóÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (Will you not then remember) what I explained to you, considering your idols as false gods and refraining from worshipping them This reasoning from Prophet Ibrahim is similar to the argument that Prophet Hud used against his people, `Ad.
