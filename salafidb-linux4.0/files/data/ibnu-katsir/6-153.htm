He informed them that those before them were destroyed because of divisions and disputes in the religion of Allah.'' Similar was said by Mujahid and several others. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "The Messenger of Allah drew a line with his hand (in the sand) and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóĞóÇ ÓóÈöíáõ Çááåö ãõÓúÊóŞöíãğÇ»</div><br>  (This is Allah's path, leading straight.)

Imam Ahmad and `Abd bin Humayd recorded (and this is the wording of Ahmad) that Jabir said; "We were sitting with the Prophet when he drew a line in front of him and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóĞóÇ ÓóÈöíáõ Çááå»</div><br>  (This is Allah's path.) He also drew two lines to its right and two lines to its left and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóĞöåö ÓõÈõáõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÇä»</div><br>  (These are the paths of Shaytan.) He then placed his hand on the middle path and recited this Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó åóÜĞóÇ ÕöÑóØöí ãõÓúÊóŞöíãğÇ İóÇÊøóÈöÚõæåõ æóáÇó ÊóÊøóÈöÚõæÇú ÇáÓøõÈõáó İóÊóİóÑøóŞó Èößõãú Úóä ÓóÈöíáöåö Ğóáößõãú æóÕøóÜßõãú Èöåö áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÊøóŞõæäó </div><br>  (And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may have Taqwa.) Imam Ahmad, Ibn Majah, in the Book of the Sunnah in his Sunan, and Al-Bazzar collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that a man asked Ibn Mas`ud, "What is As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim (the straight path)'' Ibn Mas`ud replied, "Muhammad left us at its lower end and its other end is in Paradise. To the right of this Path are other paths, and to the left of it are other paths, and there are men (on these paths) calling those who pass by them. Whoever goes on the other paths will end up in the Fire. Whoever takes the Straight Path, will end up in Paradise.'' Ibn Mas`ud then recited the Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó åóÜĞóÇ ÕöÑóØöí ãõÓúÊóŞöíãğÇ İóÇÊøóÈöÚõæåõ æóáÇó ÊóÊøóÈöÚõæÇú ÇáÓøõÈõáó İóÊóİóÑøóŞó Èößõãú Úóä ÓóÈöíáöåö</div><br>  (And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path.)'" Imam Ahmad recorded that, An-Nawwas bin Sam`an said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÖóÑóÈó Çááåõ ãóËóáğÇ ÕöÑóÇØğÇ ãõÓúÊóŞöíãğÇ¡ æóÚóäú ÌóäúÈóí ÇáÕøöÑóÇØö ÓõæÑóÇäö İöíåöãóÇ ÃóÈúæóÇÈñ ãõİóÊøóÍóÉñ¡ æóÚóáóì ÇáúÃóÈúæóÇÈö ÓõÊõæÑñ ãõÑúÎóÇÉñ æóÚóáóì ÈóÇÈö ÇáÕøöÑóÇØö ÏóÇÚò íóÏúÚõæ: íóÇ ÃóíøóåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ åóáõãøõæÇ ÇÏúÎõáõæÇ ÇáÕøöÑóÇØó ÇáúãõÓúÊóŞöíãó ÌóãöíÚğÇ æóáóÇ ÊóİóÑøóŞõæÇ æóÏóÇÚò íóÏúÚõæ ãöäú İóæúŞö ÇáÕøöÑóÇØö İóÅöĞóÇ ÃóÑóÇÏó ÇáöÅäúÓóÇäõ Ãóäú íóİúÊóÍó ÔóíúÆğÇ ãöäú Êöáúßó ÇáúÃóÈúæóÇÈö ŞóÇáó æóíúÍóßó áóÇ ÊóİúÊóÍúåõ İóÅöäøóßó Åöäú İóÊóÍúÊóåõ ÊóáöÌúåõ İóÇáÕøöÑóÇØõ ÇáÅöÓúáóÇãõ æóÇáÓøõæÑóÇäö ÍõÏõæÏõ Çááåö æóÇáúÃóÈúæóÇÈõ ÇáúãõİóÊøóÍóÉõ ãóÍóÇÑöãõ Çááåö æóĞóáößó ÇáÏøóÇÚöí Úóáóì ÑóÃúÓö ÇáÕøöÑóÇØö ßöÊóÇÈõ Çááåö¡ æóÇáÏøóÇÚöí ãöäú İóæúŞö ÇáÕøöÑóÇØö æóÇÚöÙõ Çááåö İöí ŞóáúÈö ßõáøö ãõÓúáöã»</div><br>  (Allah has given a parable of the straight path, and on the two sides of this path, there are two walls containing door ways. On these door ways, there are curtains that are lowered down. on the gate of this path there is a caller heralding, `O people! come and enter the straight path all together and do not divide. ' There is also another caller that heralds from above the path, who says when a person wants to remove the curtain on any of these doors, `Woe to you! Do not open this door, for if you open it, you will enter it. The (straight) path is Islam, the two walls are Allah's set limits, the open doors lead to Allah's prohibitions, the caller on the gate of the path is Allah's Book (the Qur'an), while the caller from above the path is Allah's admonition in the heart of every Muslim.) At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Gharib.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÊøóÈöÚõæåõ æóáÇó ÊóÊøóÈöÚõæÇú ÇáÓøõÈõáó</div><br>  (so follow it, and follow not (other) paths...) describes Allah's path in the singular sense, because truth is one. Allah describes the other paths in the plural, because they are many and are divided. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ æóáöíøõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁÇãóäõæÇú íõÎúÑöÌõåõã ãøöäó ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö Åöáóì ÇáäøõæÑö æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÃóæúáöíóÂÄõåõãõ ÇáØøóÜÛõæÊõ íõÎúÑöÌõæäóåõã ãøöäó ÇáäøõæÑö Åöáóì ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáäøóÇÑö åõãú İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó </div><br>  (Allah is the Wali (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe.
