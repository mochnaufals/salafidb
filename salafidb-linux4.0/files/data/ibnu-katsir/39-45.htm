These idols are not able to do anything; they have no minds with which to think, and they cannot hear or see. They are inanimate and are much worse off than animals. Then Allah says: `Say -- O Muhammad -- to these people who claim that those whom they have taken as intercessors with Allah, that intercession is of no avail except for the one with whom Allah is pleased and to whom He has granted permission to intercede. The whole matter rests with Him.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä ĞóÇ ÇáøóĞöì íóÔúİóÚõ ÚöäÏóåõ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÅöĞúäöåö</div><br>  (Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission) (2:255).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóåõ ãõáúßõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (His is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth.) means, He is the One Who is in control of all that.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó Åöáóíúåö ÊõÑúÌóÚõæäó</div><br>  (Then to Him you shall be brought back.) means, `on the Day of Resurrection, then He will judge between you with His justice, and He will reward or punish each person according to his deeds.'

(37:35) which means, they were too proud to follow it. Their hearts could not accept anything good, and whoever cannot accept good will accept evil.
