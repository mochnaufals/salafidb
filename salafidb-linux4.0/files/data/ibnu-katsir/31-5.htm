(5. Such are on guidance from their Lord, and such are the successful.) At the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah we discussed the letters such as those that appear at the beginning of this Surah. Allah has made the Qur'an a guidance and healing and a mercy for the Muhsinin, who are those who do good deeds in accordance with the Shari`ah. They establish the obligatory prayers in the proper manner and at the correct times, and follow that with regular, optional and supererogatory prayers; they pay the Zakah to those who deserve it; they uphold the ties of kinship with their relatives; they have certain faith that there will be rewards and punishments in the Hereafter, and they seek the reward with Allah; they do not show off or seek a reward or thanks from other people. Whoever does this is one of those of whom Allah says:</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó Úóáóì åõÏğì ãøöä ÑøóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  (Such are on guidance from their Lord,) meaning, they follow His guidance with clear understanding.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúãõİúáöÍõæäó</div><br>  (and such are the successful.) in this world and in the Hereafter.  </div></body></html>
