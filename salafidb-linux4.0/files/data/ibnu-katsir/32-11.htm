Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú åõã ÈöáóŞóÂÁö ÑóÈøöåöãú ßóÜİöÑõæäó</div><br>  (Nay, but they deny the meeting with their Lord!)

The apparent meaning of this Ayah is that the angel of death is a specific personality among the angels, as is also apparent from the Hadith of Al-Bara' which we quoted in (our Tafsir of) Surah Ibrahim. In some reports he (the angel of death) is called `Izra'il, which is well known. This is the view of Qatadah and others. The angel of death has helpers. It was reported in the Hadith that his helpers draw out the soul from the rest of the body until it reaches the throat, then the angel of death takes it. Mujahid said, "The earth is brought together for him and it is like a platter from which he takes whenever he wants.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó Åöáóì ÑóÈøößõãú ÊõÑúÌóÚõæäó</div><br>  (Then you shall be brought to your Lord.) means, on the Day when you are resurrected and brought forth from your graves to receive your reward or punishment.  </div></body></html>
