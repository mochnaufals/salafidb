The scholars differed as to the meaning of this (i.e. Imam. Mujahid and Qatadah said that it meant each nation would be called to account by its Prophet. Some of the Salaf said this is the greatest honor for the people of Hadith, because their leader is the Prophet . Ibn Zayd said it means they would be called to account by their Book which was revealed to their Prophet with its laws. This was also the view favored by Ibn Jarir. Ibn Abi Najih narrated that Mujahid said, "With their Books.'' It may be that what is meant here is what Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas concerning this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó äóÏúÚõæÇú ßõáøó ÃõäóÇÓò ÈöÅöãóÜãöåöãú</div><br>  ((And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imam), which is that it refers to the Book (or record) of their deeds. This was also the view of Abu Al-`Aliyah, Al-Hasan and Ad-Dahhak. This view is the most correct, because Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõáøó ÔìúÁò ÃóÍúÕóíúäóÜåõ İöì ÅöãóÇãò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (and all things We have recorded with numbers (as a record) in a Clear Book Fi Imamin Mubin) 36:12   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæõÖöÚó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈõ İóÊóÑóì ÇáúãõÌúÑöãöíäó ãõÔúİöŞöíäó ãöãøóÇ İöíåö</div><br>  (And the Book (one's record) will be placed, and you will see the criminals, fearful of that which is (recorded) therein) 18:49   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóì ßõáøó ÃõãøóÉò ÌóÇËöíóÉğ ßõáøõ ÃãøóÉò ÊõÏúÚóì Åöáóì ßöÊóÜÈöåóÇ Çáúíóæúãó ÊõÌúÒóæúäó ãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ ßöÊóÜÈõäóÇ íóäØöŞõ Úóáóíúßõã ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö ÅöäøóÇ ßõäøóÇ äóÓúÊóäÓöÎõ ãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (And you will see each nation humbled to their knees, each nation will be called to its record (of deeds). This Day you shall be recompensed for what you used to do. This Our record speaks about you with truth. Verily, We were recording what you used to do.) (45:28-29) This does not contradict the fact that the Prophet will be brought forward when Allah judges between his Ummah, for he will inevitably be a witness against his Ummah over their deeds. But what is meant here by Imam is the Book of deeds. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó äóÏúÚõæÇú ßõáøó ÃõäóÇÓò ÈöÅöãóÜãöåöãú İóãóäú ÃõæÊöìó ßöÊóÜÈóåõ Èöíóãöíäöåö İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó íóŞúÑóÁõæäó ßöÊóÜÈóåõãú</div><br>  ((And remember) the Day when We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imam. So whosoever is given his record in his right hand, such will read their records,) means, because of their happiness and joy at what is recorded therein of good deeds - they will read it and want to read it. As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóãøóÇ ãóäú ÃõæÊöìó ßöÊóÜÈóåõ Èöíóãöíäöåö İóíóŞõæáõ åóÂÄõãõ ÇŞúÑóÄõÇú ßöÊóÜÈíóåú </div><br>  (Then as for him who will be given his record in his right hand will say: "Here! read my record!) until His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ãóäú ÃõæÊöìó ßöÊóÜÈóåõ ÈöÔöãóÇáöåö</div><br>  (But as for him who will be given his record in his left hand,) 69:19-29   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõÙúáóãõæäó İóÊöíáÇğ</div><br>  (and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least Fatilan.)
