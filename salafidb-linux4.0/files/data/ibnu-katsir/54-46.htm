A Messenger came to them from Allah, Musa supported by his brother Harun. Their Messengers delivered good news if they believe, and a warning if they rejected the Message. Allah supported Musa and Harun with tremendous miracles and great signs, but Fir`awn and his people rejected all of them. Allah took them the way the All-Mighty, the All-Capable would; He destroyed them all leaving none surviving to tell the story of what happened to them. Advising and Threatening the Quraysh Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóßõİøóÜÑõßõãú</div><br>  (Are your disbelievers) meaning, `O idolators of the Quraysh,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóíúÑñ ãøöäú ÃõæúáóÜÆößõãú</div><br>  (better than these) meaning better than the nations that were mentioned here, who were destroyed on account of their disbelief in the Messengers and rejecting the Scriptures. `Are you better than these'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú áóßõã ÈóÑóÂÁóÉñ İöì ÇáÒøõÈõÑö</div><br>  (Or have you immunity in the Divine Scriptures), `do you have immunity from Allah that the torment and punishment will not touch you' Allah said about the Quraysh,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú íóŞõæáõæäó äóÍúäõ ÌóãöíÚñ ãøõäÊóÕöÑñ </div><br>  (Or say they: "We are a great multitude, victorious'') stating that they believed they will support each other and their great gathering will avail them against those who intend to harm them. Allah the Exalted responded,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóíõåúÒóãõ ÇáúÌóãúÚõ æóíõæóáøõæäó ÇáÏøõÈõÑó </div><br>  (Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs.) affirming that their gathering shall scatter, and they shall be defeated. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "The Prophet , while in a dome-shaped tent on the day of the battle of Badr, said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÔõÏõßó ÚóåúÏóßó æóæóÚúÏóßó¡ Çááúåõãøó Åöäú ÔöÆúÊó áóãú ÊõÚúÈóÏú ÈóÚúÏó Çáúíóæúãö İöí ÇáúÃóÑúÖö ÃóÈóÏğÇ»</div><br>  (O Allah! I ask you for the fulfillment of Your covenant and promise. O Allah! If You wish (to destroy the believers), You will never be worshipped on the earth after today.) Abu Bakr caught him by the hand and said, `This is sufficient, O Allah's Messenger! You have sufficiently asked and petitioned Allah.' The Prophet was clad in his armor at that time and went out, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóíõåúÒóãõ ÇáúÌóãúÚõ æóíõæóáøõæäó ÇáÏøõÈõÑó - Èóáö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ãóæúÚöÏõåõãú æóÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ÃóÏúåóì æóÃóãóÑøõ </div><br>  (Their multitude will be put to flight and they will show their backs. Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time and that Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.)'' Al-Bukhari also recorded that Yusuf bin Mahak said, "I was with the Mother of the faithful, `A'ishah, when she said, `When I was still a young playful girl in Makkah, this Ayah was revealed to Muhammad ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ãóæúÚöÏõåõãú æóÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ÃóÏúåóì æóÃóãóÑøõ </div><br>  (Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time and that Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.)'' This is the abridged narration that Al-Bukhari collected, but he also collected a longer narration of it in the Book of the Virtues of the Qur'an. Muslim did not collect this Hadith.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõÌúÑöãöíäó İöì ÖóáóÜáò æóÓõÚõÑò - íóæúãó íõÓúÍóÈõæäó İöì ÇáäøóÇÑö Úóáóì æõÌõæåöåöãú ĞõæŞõæÇú ãóÓøó ÓóŞóÑó </div><br>  </div></body></html>
