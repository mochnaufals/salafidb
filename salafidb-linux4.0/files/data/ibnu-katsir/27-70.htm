Then He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú æõÚöÏúäóÇ åóÜĞóÇ äóÍúäõ æóÁóÇÈóÂÄõäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (Indeed we were promised this -- we and our forefathers before,) meaning, `we and our forefathers have been hearing this for a long time, but in reality, we have never seen it happen.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäú åóÜĞóÂ ÅöáÇøó ÃóÓóÜØöíÑõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó</div><br>  (verily, these are nothing but tales of ancients.) the promises that bodies will be restored are   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÃóÓóÜØöíÑõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó</div><br>  (nothing but tales of ancients.) meaning that they were taken by the people who came before us from books which were handed down from one to the other, but they have no basis in reality. Responding to their thoughts of disbelief and their belief that there would be no Resurrection, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú</div><br>  (Say) `O Muhammad, to these people,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓöíÑõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö İóÇúäÙõÑõæÇú ßóíúİó ßóÇäó ÚóÜŞöÈóÉõ ÇáúãõÌúÑöãöíäó</div><br>  (Travel in the land and see how has been the end of the criminals. ) meaning, those who denied the Messengers and their message of the Resurrection and other matters. See how the punishment and vengeance of Allah struck them and how Allah saved from among them the noble Messengers and the believers who followed them. This will be an indication of the truth of the Message brought by the Messengers. Then, to comfort the Prophet , Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÍúÒóäú Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (And grieve you not over them,) meaning, `but do not feel sorry for them or kill yourself with regret for them,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó Êóßõä İöì ÖóíúŞò ãøöãøóÇ íóãúßõÑõæäó</div><br>  (nor be straitened because of what they plot.) means, `because they plot against you and reject what you have brought, for Allah will help and support you, and cause your religion to prevail over those who oppose you and stubbornly resist you in the east and in the west.'  </div></body></html>
