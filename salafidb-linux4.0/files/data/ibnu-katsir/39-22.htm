This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÒóáúäóÇ ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ãóÂÁğ ØóåõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (and We send down pure water from the sky) (25:48). So, Allah sends down water from the sky, and it settles in the earth, then He causes it to flow wherever He wills, and He causes springs, great and small, to flow as needed. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóáóßóåõ íóäóÇÈöíÚó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (and causes it to penetrate the earth, as water springs,) Sa`id bin Jubayr and `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said that all the water on earth has its origins in the sky. Sa`id bin Jubayr said, its origins lie in the snow, meaning that snow piles up in the mountains, then settles at the bottom (of the mountains) and springs flow from the bottom of them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó íõÎúÑöÌõ Èöåö ÒóÑúÚÇğ ãøõÎúÊóáöİÇğ ÃóáúæóÇäõåõ</div><br>  (and afterward thereby produces crops of different colors) means, then from the water which comes down from the sky or flows from springs in the earth, He brings forth crops of different colors, i.e., different kinds of forms, tastes, scents, bencfits, etc.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó íóåöÜíÌõ</div><br>  (and afterward they wither) means, after they have been ripe and fresh, they become old and you see them turn yellow when they have dried out.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó íóÌúÚóáõåõ ÍõØóÜãÇğ</div><br>  (then He makes them dry and broken pieces.) means, then they become brittle.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áóĞößúÑóì áÇøñæúáöì ÇáÇøñáúÈóÜÈö</div><br>  (Verily, in this is a reminder for men of understanding.) means, those who are reminded by this and who learn the lesson from it, that this world is like this -- it is green and fresh and beautiful, then it will become old and ugly. The young man will become a weak, senile old man, and after all of that comes death. The blessed one is the one whose state after death will be good. Allah often likens the life of this world to the way He sends down water from the sky and crops and fruits grow thereby, then they become dry and brittle. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÖúÑöÈú áóåõã ãøóËóáó ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ßóãóÂÁò ÃóäúÒóáúäóÜåõ ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö İóÇÎúÊóáóØó Èöåö äóÈóÇÊõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖö İóÃóÕúÈóÍó åóÔöíãğÇ ÊóĞúÑõæåõ ÇáÑøöíÇÍõ æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ãøõŞúÊóÏöÑğÇ </div><br>  (And put forward to them the example of the life of this world: it is like the water (rain) which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green. But (later) it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds scatter. And Allah is able to do everything) (18:45) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The People of Truth and the People of Misguidance are not Equal</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóİóãóä ÔóÑóÍó Çááøóåõ ÕóÏúÑóåõ áöáÅöÓúáóÜãö İóåõæó Úóáóì äõæÑò ãøöä ÑøóÈøöåö</div><br>  (Is he whose breast Allah has opened to Islam, so that he is in light from his Lord) means, is this person equal to the one who is hard-hearted and far from the truth This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæóãóä ßóÇäó ãóíúÊğÇ İóÃóÍúíóíúäóÜåõ æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ áóåõ äõæÑğÇ íóãúÔöí Èöåö İöì ÇáäøóÇÓö ßóãóä ãøóËóáõåõ İöí ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö áóíúÓó ÈöÎóÇÑöÌò ãøöäúåóÇ ßóĞóáößó</div><br>  (Is he who was dead and We gave him life and set for him a light (i.e. Belief) whereby he can walk amongst men -- like him who is in the darkness (i.e., disbelief) from which he can never come out) (6:122) Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóæóíúáñ áøöáúŞóÜÓöíóÉö ŞõáõæÈõåõãú ãøöä ĞößúÑö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (So, woe to those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of Allah!) meaning, they do not become soft when Allah is mentioned, and they do not feel humility or fear, and they do not understand.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó İöì ÖóáóÜáò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (They are in plain error!).  </div></body></html>
