Allah sent down the revelation,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóäóÏúÚõæÇú ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ãóÇ áÇó íóäİóÚõäóÇ æóáÇó íóÖõÑøõäóÇ æóäõÑóÏøõ Úóáóì ÃóÚúŞóÜÈöäóÇ</div><br>  (Say: "Shall we invoke others besides Allah, that can do us neither good nor harm, and shall we turn on our heels...'') by reverting to disbelief,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóÚúÏó ÅöĞú åóÏóÇäóÇ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  ("...after Allah has guided us.'') for if we do this, our example will be like he whom the devils have caused to wander in confusion throughout the land. Allah says here, your example, if you revert to disbelief after you believed, is that of a man who went with some people on a road, but he lost his way and the devils led him to wander in confusion over the land. Meanwhile, his companions on the road were calling him to come to them saying, `Come back to us, for we are on the path.' But, he refused to go back to them. This is the example of he who follows the devil after recognizing Muhammad , and Muhammad is the person who is calling the people to the path, and the path is Islam.'' Ibn Jarir recorded this statement.Allah's statement, j   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇáøóĞöì ÇÓúÊóåúæóÊúåõ ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäõ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (Like one whom the Shayatin (devils) have made to go astray (wandering) through the land, ) refers to ghouls,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÏúÚõæäóåõ</div><br>  (calling him) by his name, his father's and his grandfather's names. So he follows the devils' call thinking that it is a path of guidance, but by the morning he will find himself destroyed and perhaps they eat him. The Jinns will then let him wander in a wasteland where he will die of thirst. This is the example of those who follow the false gods that are being worshipped instead of Allah, Most Honored. Ibn Jarir also recorded this.
