It was reported that Mujahid said, "A shelter,'' and that Qatadah said, "A helper or supporter.''

It was said that this was revealed about the nobles of Quraysh when they asked the Prophet to sit with them on his own, and not to bring his weak Companions with him, such as Bilal, `Ammar, Suhayb, Khabbab and Ibn Mas`ud. They wanted him to sit with them on his own, but Allah forbade him from doing that, and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóØúÑõÏö ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÏúÚõæäó ÑóÈøóåõãú ÈöÇáúÛóÏóÇÉö æóÇáúÚóÔöìøö</div><br>  (And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon.)

Imam Muslim recorded in his Sahih that Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas who said: "There was a group of six of us with the Prophet . The idolators said, `Tell these people to leave so they will not offend us.' There was myself, Ibn Mas`ud, a man from Hudayl, Bilal and two other men whose names I have forgotten. Allah's Messenger thought to himself about whatever Allah willed he should think about, then Allah revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóØúÑõÏö ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÏúÚõæäó ÑóÈøóåõãú ÈöÇáúÛóÏóÇÉö æóÇáúÚóÔöìøö íõÑöíÏõæäó æóÌúåóåõ</div><br>  (And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon.)
