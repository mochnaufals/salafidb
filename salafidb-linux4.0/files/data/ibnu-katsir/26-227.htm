Allah stated that His Messenger was above their claims and fabrications, and that what he had brought did indeed come from Allah, and that it was a revelation and inspiration, brought down by a noble, trustworthy and mighty angel. It did not come from the Shayatin, because they have no desire for anything like this Noble Qur'an -- they descend upon those who are like them, the lying fortune-tellers. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú ÃõäóÈøöÆõßõãú</div><br>  (Shall I inform you) meaning, shall I tell you,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú ÃõäóÈøöÆõßõãú Úóáóì ãóä ÊóäóÒøóáõ ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäõ - ÊóäóÒøóáõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÃóİøóÇßò ÃóËöíãò </div><br>  (upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person (Athim)) meaning, one whose speech is lies and fabrication.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóËöíãò</div><br>  (Athim) means, whose deeds are immoral. This is the person upon whom the Shayatin descend, fortune-tellers and other sinful liars. The Shayatin are also sinful liars.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõáúŞõæäó ÇáÓøóãúÚó</div><br>  (Who gives ear, ) means, they try to overhear what is said in the heavens, and they try to hear something of the Unseen, then they add to it a hundred lies and tell it to their human comrades, who then tell it to others. Then the people believe everything they say because they were right about the one thing which was heard from the heavens. This was stated in an authentic Hadith recorded by Al-Bukhari from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, "The people asked the Prophet about fortune-tellers, and he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóåõãú áóíúÓõæÇ ÈöÔóíúÁ»</div><br>  (They are nothing.) They said: "O Messenger of Allah, they say things that come true.''

Then when the Jinn who are listening out, one above the other) -- and Sufyan illustrated this with a gesture, holding his hand vertically with his fingers outspread -- (when they hear this, they throw it down from one to another, until it is passed to the fortune-teller or soothsayer.

This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari recorded from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉó ÊóÍóÏøóËõ İöí ÇáúÚóäóÇäö æóÇáúÚóäóÇäõ: ÇáúÛóãóÇãõ ÈöÇáúÃóãúÑö (íóßõæäõ) İöí ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ İóÊóÓúãóÚõ ÇáÔøóíóÇØöíäõ ÇáúßóáöãóÉó¡ İóÊóŞõÑøõåóÇ İöí ÃõĞõäö ÇáúßóÇåöäö ßóãóÇ ÊõŞóÑøõ ÇáúŞóÇÑõæÑóÉõ¡ İóíóÒöíÏõæäó ãóÚóåóÇ ãöÇÆóÉó ßóĞúÈóÉ»</div><br>  (The angels speak in the clouds about some matter on earth, and the Shayatin overhear what they say, so they tell it to the fortune-teller, gurgling into his ear like (a liquid poured) from a glass bottle, and he adds to it one hundred lies.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Refutation of the Claim that the Prophet was a Poet</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÔøõÚóÑóÂÁõ íóÊøóÈöÚõåõãõ ÇáúÛóÇæõæäó </div><br>  (As for the poets, the astray ones follow them.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means: "The disbelievers follow the misguided among mankind and the Jinn.'' This was also the view of Mujahid, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, and others. `Ikrimah said, "Two poets would ridicule one another in verse, with one group of people supporting one and another group supporting the other.

This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir from the narration of Ibn Ishaq. But this Surah was revealed in Makkah, so how could the reason for its revelation be the poets of the Ansar This is something worth thinking about. The reports that have been narrated about this are all Mursal and cannot be relied on. And Allah knows best. But this exception could include the poets of the Ansar and others. It even includes those poets of the Jahiliyyah who indulged in condemning Islam and its followers, then repented and turned to Allah, and gave up what they used to do and started to do righteous deeds and remember Allah much, to make up for the bad things that they had previously said, for good deeds wipe out bad deeds. So they praised Islam and its followers in order to make up for their insults, as the poet `Abdullah bin Az-Zab`ari said when he became Muslim: "O Messenger of Allah, indeed my tongue will try to make up for things it said when I was bad -- When I went along with the Shaytan during the years of misguidance, and whoever inclines towards his way is in a state of loss.'' Similarly, Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abd Al-Muttalib was one of the most hostile people towards the Prophet , even though he was his cousin, and he was the one who used to mock him the most. But when he became Muslim, there was no one more beloved to him than the Messenger of Allah . He began to praise the Messenger of Allah where he had mocked him, and take him as a close friend where he had regarded him as an enemy.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇäÊóÕóÑõæÇú ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÙõáöãõæÇú</div><br>  (and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged.) Ibn `Abbas said, "They responded in kind to the disbelievers who used to ridicule the believers in verse.'' This was also the view of Mujahid, Qatadah and several others. It was also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said to Hassan:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇåúÌõåõã»</div><br>  (Ridicule them in verse.)
