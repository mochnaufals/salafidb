He causes men to die (the "greater death'') when He sends the angels to take men's souls from their bodies, and He causes them to "die a lesser death'' when they sleep.

Here Allah mentions the two deaths, the lesser death then the greater death after it; in the Ayah above (39: 42), He mentions the greater then the lesser.

This indicates that they the souls meet in the higher realm, as was stated in the Hadith attributed to the Prophet which was narrated by Ibn Mandah and others. In the Two Sahihs of Al-Bukhari and Muslim, it is reported that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ Ãóæóì ÃóÍóÏõßõãú Åöáì İöÑóÇÔöåö İóáúíóäúİõÖúåõ ÈöÏóÇÎöáóÉö ÅöÒóÇÑöåö¡ İóÅöäøóåõ áóÇ íóÏúÑöí ãóÇ Îóáóİóåõ Úóáóíúåö¡ Ëõãøó áöíóŞõáú: ÈöÇÓúãößó ÑóÈøöí æóÖóÚúÊõ ÌóäúÈöí¡ æóÈößó ÃóÑúİóÚõåõ¡ Åöäú ÃóãúÓóßúÊó äóİúÓöí İóÇÑúÍóãúåóÇ¡ æóÅöäú ÃóÑúÓóáúÊóåóÇ İóÇÍúİóÙúåóÇ ÈöãóÇ ÊóÍúİóÙõ Èöåö ÚöÈóÇÏóßó ÇáÕøóÇáöÍöíä»</div><br>  (When anyone of you goes to bed, let him brush down the bed with his garment, for he does not know what has come on his bed since he left it. Then let him say, "In Your Name, O Lord, I lay down my side and in Your Name I raise it up; if You take my soul, have mercy on it, and if You send it back, protect it with that which You protect Your righteous servants.'')   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíõãúÓößõ ÇáøóÊöì ŞóÖóì ÚóáóíúåóÇ ÇáúãóæúÊó</div><br>  (He keeps those (souls) for which He has ordained death) means, those which have died, and He returns the others back for an appointed term. As-Suddi said, "For the rest of their lives.'' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "He keeps the souls of the dead and sends back the souls of the living, and He does not make any mistakes.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğáößó áÂíóÜÊò áøöŞóæúãò íóÊóİóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, in this are signs for a people who think deeply.)  </div></body></html>
