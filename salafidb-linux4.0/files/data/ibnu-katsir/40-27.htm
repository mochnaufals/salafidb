The second command was for the second reason, to humiliate the people so that they would regard Musa as a bad omen. they said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæĞöíäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä ÊóÃúÊöíóäóÇ æóãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌöÆúÊóäóÇ ŞóÇáó ÚóÓóì ÑóÈøõßõãú Ãóä íõåúáößó ÚóÏõæøóßõãú æóíóÓúÊóÎúáöİóßõãú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö İóíóäÙõÑó ßóíúİó ÊóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  ("We (Children of Israel) had suffered troubles before you came to us, and since you have come to us.''
