Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who had Taqwa.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Description of the Gardens of the Truthful and Those Who repent</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah, the Exalted, says that the Gardens (of Paradise), which the penitent will enter, will be Gardens of `Adn, meaning, eternity. These are Gardens that the Most Beneficent promises His servants in the unseen. This means that these Gardens are from the unseen things that they believe in, even though they have never witnessed them. They believe in the unseen out of their strong conviction and the strength of their faith. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó æóÚúÏõåõ ãóÃúÊöíøÇğ</div><br>  (Verily, His promise must come to pass.) This affirms the fact that this will occur, and that it is a settled matter. Allah does not break His promise, nor does He change it. This is similar to His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇäó æóÚúÏõåõ ãóİúÚõæáÇğ</div><br>  (His promise is certainly to be accomplished.) 73:18 This means that His promise will be and there is no avoiding it. Allah's statement here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÃúÊöíøÇğ</div><br>  (must come to pass.) This means that it will come to His servants who are striving towards it and they will reach it. There are those commentators who said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÃúÊöíøÇğ</div><br>  (must come to pass.) "This means it is coming, because everything that comes to you, you also come to it. This is as the Arabs say, `Fifty years came to me, and I came to fifty years.' They both mean the same thing (I'm fifty years old).'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóÓúãóÚõæäó İöíåóÇ áóÛúæÇğ</div><br>  (They shall not hear therein any Laghw.) This means that in these gardens of Paradise there is no ignorant, wasteful and useless speech, like there is in this life. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÓóáóÜãÇğ</div><br>  (...but only Salam.) This is an indifferent exception, similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÓúãóÚõæäó İöíåóÇ áóÛúæÇğ æóáÇó ÊóÃúËöíãÇğ - ÅöáÇøó ŞöíáÇğ ÓóáóÜãÇğ ÓóáóÜãÇğ </div><br>  (No Laghw will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech. But only the saying of: Salam! Salam!) 56:25-26 Concerning His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóåõãú ÑöÒúŞõåõãú İöíåóÇ ÈõßúÑóÉğ æóÚóÔöíøÇğ</div><br>  (And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and afternoon.) This means, in what is similar to mornings and evenings. This does not mean that there is a night and a day (in Paradise), but they will be living in times that alternate. They will know its lighted times from its lights and illumination. This is as Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóæøóáõ ÒõãúÑóÉò ÊóáöÌõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ÕõæóÑõåõãú Úóáóì ÕõæÑóÉö ÇáúŞóãóÑö áóíúáóÉó ÇáúÈóÏúÑö áóÇ íóÈúÕõŞõæäó İöíåóÇ¡æóáóÇ íóÊóãóÎøóØõæäó İöíåóÇ. æóáóÇíóÊóÛóæøóØõæäó¡ ÂäöíóÊõåõãú æóÃóãúÔóÇØõåõãõ ÇáĞøóåóÈõ æóÇáúİöÖøóÉõ æóãóÌóÇãöÑõåõãõ ÇáúÃóáõæøóÉõ¡ æóÑóÔúÍõåõãõ ÇáúãöÓúßõ æóáößõáøö æóÇÍöÏò ãöäúåõãú ÒóæúÌóÊóÇäö¡ íõÑóì ãõÎøõ ÓóÇŞöåóÇ ãöäú æóÑóÇÁö ÇááøóÍúãö ãöäó ÇáúÍõÓúäö¡ áóÇ ÇÎúÊöáóÇİó Èóíúäóåõãú æóáóÇ ÊóÈóÇÛõÖó¡ ŞõáõæÈõåõãú Úóáóì ŞóáúÈö ÑóÌõáò æóÇÍöÏò¡ íõÓóÈøöÍõæäó Çááåó ÈõßúÑóÉğ æóÚóÔöíøğÇ»</div><br>  (The first group to enter into Paradise will have forms like the form of the moon on a night when it is full. They will not spit, nor will they blow their noses therein. They also will not defecate. Their containers and combs will be made of gold and silver and their censers will be of aloeswood. Their sweat will be the fragrance of musk and each of them will have two wives. The marrow of their shins will be visible from beneath the skin due to their beauty. They will not have any disputes between them, or any hatred. Their hearts will be united like the heart of one man. They will glorify Allah in the morning and evening.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim both recorded this narration in the Two Sahihs. Imam Ahmad also recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÔøõåóÏóÇÁõ Úóáóì ÈóÇÑöŞö äóåúÑò ÈöÈóÇÈö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö İöí ŞõÈøóÉò ÎóÖúÑóÇÁó¡ íóÎúÑõÌõ Úóáóíúåöãú ÑöÒúŞõåõãú ãöäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÈõßúÑóÉğ æóÚóÔöíøğÇ»</div><br>  (The martyrs will be upon the banks of a river by the gates of Paradise. Over them will be a green dome. Their sustenance will be brought out to them from Paradise, morning and evening.) Ahmad is the only one who collected this narration. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóåõãú ÑöÒúŞõåõãú İöíåóÇ ÈõßúÑóÉğ æóÚóÔöíøÇğ</div><br>  (And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and afternoon.) "This means the amount of time equal to night and day.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÇáúÌóäøóÉõ ÇáøóÊöì äõæÑöËõ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöäóÇ ãóä ßóÇäó ÊóŞöíøÇğ </div><br>  (Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who had Taqwa.) This means, `This Paradise that We have described with these magnificent attributes, it is that which We will cause are pious servants to inherit.' They are those who obey Allah in happiness and times of hardship. They are those who suppress their anger and they pardon people's offenses. This is as Allah says at the beginning of Surah Al-Mu'minun,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃóİúáóÍó ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó - ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú İöì ÕóáÇóÊöåöãú ÎóÜÔöÚõæäó </div><br>  (Successful indeed are the believers. Those who are humble in their Salah.) 23:1-2 Until His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúæóÑöËõæäó - ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÑöËõæäó ÇáúİöÑúÏóæúÓó åõãú İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó </div><br>  (These are indeed the inheritors. Who shall inherit the Firdaws. In it they shall dwell forever.) 23:10-11  </div></body></html>
