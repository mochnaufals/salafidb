He disowned every other deity that was being worshipped instead of Allah and defied all his people in this regard.

Abu Al-`Aliyah and Qatadah said, "This Ayah (2:130) was revealed about the Jews who invented a practice that did not come from Allah and that defied the religion of Ibrahim.''

Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad ) and those who have believed (Muslims). And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.) (3:67-68), testifies to this fact.  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ŞóÇáó áóåõ ÑóÈøõåõ ÃóÓúáöãú ŞóÇáó ÃóÓúáóãúÊõ áöÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (When his Lord said to him, "Submit (i. e. be a Muslim)!'' He said, "I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists).'')  This Ayah indicates that Allah commanded Ibrahim to be sincere with Him and to abide and submit to Him; Ibrahim perfectly adhered to Allah's command. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóÕøóì ÈöåóÂ ÅöÈúÑóåöíãõ Èóäöíåö æóíóÚúŞõæÈõ</div><br>  (And this (submission to Allah, Islam) was enjoined by Ibrahim upon his sons and by Ya`qub) means, Ibrahim commanded his offspring to follow this religion, that is, Islam, for Allah. Or, the Ayah might be referring to Ibrahim's words,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÓúáóãúÊõ áöÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  (I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists)).  This means that these Prophets loved these words so much that they preserved them until the time of death and advised their children to adhere to them after them. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáóåóÇ ßóáöãóÉğ ÈóÜŞöíóÉğ İöì ÚóŞöÈöåö</div><br>  (And he (Ibrahim) made it i.e. La ilaha illallah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah alone) a Word lasting among his offspring, (true Monotheism)) (43:28).  It might be that Ibrahim advised his children, including Jacob, Isaac's son, who were present. It appears, and Allah knows best, that Isaac was endowed with Jacob, during the lifetime of Ibrahim and Sarah, for the good news includes both of them in Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈóÔøóÑúäóÜåóÇ ÈöÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóãöä æóÑóÂÁö ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó íóÚúŞõæÈó</div><br>  (But We gave her (Sarah) glad tidings of Ishaq (Isaac), and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub (Jacob)) (11:71).  Also, if Jacob was not alive then, there would be no use here in mentioning him specifically among Isaac's children. Also, Allah said in Surat Al-`Ankabut,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóåóÈúäóÇ áóåõ ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóíóÚúŞõæÈó æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöì ĞõÑøöíøóÊöåö ÇáäøõÈõæøóÉó æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (And We bestowed on him (Ibrahim), Ishaq and Ya`qub, and We ordained among his offspring prophethood and the Book.)

Also, Jacob built Bayt Al-Maqdis, as earlier books testified. The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Dharr said, "I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Which Masjid was built first' He said, (Al-Masjid Al-Haram (Al-Ka`bah).) I said, `Then' He said, (Bayt Al- Maqdis.) I said, `How many years later' He said, (Forty years. )'' Further, the advice that Jacob gave to his children, which we will soon mention, testifies that Jacob was among those who received the advice mentioned in Ayat above (2:130-132). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Adhering to Tawhid until Death</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÈóäöìøó Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÇÕúØóİóì áóßõãõ ÇáÏøöíäó İóáÇó ÊóãõæÊõäøó ÅóáÇøó æóÃóäÊõã ãøõÓúáöãõæäó</div><br>  ((Saying), "O my sons! Allah has chosen for you the (true) religion, then die not except as Muslims.'') meaning, perform righteous deeds during your lifetime and remain on this path, so that Allah will endow you with the favor of dying upon it. Usually, one dies upon the path that he lived on and is resurrected according to what he died on. Allah, the Most Generous, helps those who seek to do good deeds to remain on the righteous path.
