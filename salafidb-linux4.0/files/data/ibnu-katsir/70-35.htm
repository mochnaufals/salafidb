He will withhold the right of Allah with that blessing. Imam Ahmad said that Abu `Abdur-Rahman informed them that Musa bin `Ali bin Rabah told them that he heard his father narrating from `Abdul-`Aziz bin Marwan bin Al-Hakim that he heard Abu Hurayrah saying, "The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÔóÑøõ ãóÇ İöí ÑóÌõáò: ÔõÍøñ åóÇáöÚñ æóÌõÈúäñ ÎóÇáöÚ»</div><br>  (The worst thing that can be in a man is greedy impatience and unrestrained cowardice.) Abu Dawud recorded this Hadith from `Abdullah bin Al-Jarrah on the authority of Abu `Abdur-Rahman Al-Muqri', and this is the only Hadith through `Abdul-`Aziz with him. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Exclusion of Those Who pray from what has preceded and an Explanation of Their Deeds and Their Prayer</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÇáúãõÕóáøöíäó </div><br>  (Except those who are devoted to Salah.) meaning, man is described with blameworthy characteristics except for He whom Allah protects, helps and guides to good, making its means easy for him -- and these are those people who perform Salah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú Úóáóì ÕóáÇóÊöåöãú ÏóÂÆöãõæäó </div><br>  (Those who with their Salah are Da'imun;) It has been said that this means they guard its times and the elements obligatory in it. This has been said by Ibn Mas`ud, Masruq and Ibrahim An-Nakha`i. It has also been said that it means tranquility and humble concentration (in the prayer). This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃóİúáóÍó ÇáúãõÄúãöäõæäó - ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú İöì ÕóáÇóÊöåöãú ÎóÜÔöÚõæäó </div><br>  (Successful indeed are the believers. Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un.) (23:1-2) This was said by `Uqbah bin `Amir. From its meanings is the same terminology used to describe standing (still) water (Al-Ma' Ad-Da'im). This proves the obligation of having tranquility in the prayer. For verily, the one who does not have tranquility (stillness of posture) in his bowing and prostrating, then he is not being constant (Da'im) in his prayer. This is because he is not being still in it and he does not remain (in its positions), rather he pecks in it (quickly) like the pecking of the crow. Therefore, he is not successful in performing his prayer. It has also been said that the meaning here refers to those who perform a deed and are constant in its performance and consistent in it. This is like the Hadith that has been recorded in the Sahih on the authority of `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÍóÈøõ ÇáúÃóÚúãóÇáö Åöáóì Çááåö ÃóÏúæóãõåóÇ æóÅöäú Şóá»</div><br>  (The most beloved deeds to Allah are those that are most consistent, even if they are few.) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó İöì Ãóãúæóáöåöãú ÍóŞøñ ãøóÚúáõæãñ - áøöáÓøóÂÆöáö æóÇáúãóÍúÑõæãö </div><br>  (And those in whose wealth there is a recognized right. For the one who asks, and for the deprived.) meaning, in their wealth is a determined portion for those who are in need. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó íõÕóÏøöŞõæäó Èöíóæúãö ÇáÏøöíäö </div><br>  (And those who believe in the Day of Recompense.) meaning, they are sure of the Final Return (to Allah), the Reckoning and the Recompense. Therefore, they perform the deeds of one who hopes for the reward and fears the punishment. For this reason Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõã ãøöäú ÚóĞóÇÈö ÑóÈøöåöã ãøõÔúİöŞõæäó </div><br>  (And those who fear the torment of their Lord. ) meaning, they are fearful and dreadful.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÚóĞóÇÈó ÑóÈøöåöãú ÛóíúÑõ ãóÃúãõæäò </div><br>  (Verily, the torment of their Lord is that before which none can feel secure.) meaning, no one is safe from it (Allah's torment) of those who understand the command from Allah, except by the security of Allah Himself. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú áöİõÑõæÌöåöãú ÍóÜİöÙõæäó </div><br>  (And those who guard their private part (chastity).) meaning, they keep their private parts away from that which is forbidden and they prevent their private parts from being put into other than what Allah has allowed them to be in. This is why Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Úóáóì ÃóÒúæóÌöåöãú Ãóæú ãóÇ ãóáóßóÊú ÃóíúãóÜäõåõãú</div><br>  (Except from their wives or their right hand possessions) meaning, from their female slaves.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Úóáóì ÃóÒúæóÌöåöãú Ãóæú ãóÇ ãóáóßóÊú ÃóíúãóÜäõåõãú İóÅöäøóåõãú ÛóíúÑõ ãóáõæãöíäó - İóãóäö ÇÈúÊóÛóì æóÑóÂÁó Ğáößó İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÚóÇÏõæäó </div><br>  (for (then) they are not blameworthy. But whosoever seeks beyond that, then it is those who are trespassers.) The explanation of this has already preceded at the beginning of Surat Al-Mu'minun, and therefore does not need to be repeated here. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú áÇøğãóÜäóÜÊöåöãú æóÚóåúÏöåöãú ÑóÚõæäó </div><br>  (And those who keep their trusts and covenants.) meaning, if they are given a trust they do not deceit and when they make a covenant they do not break it. These are the characteristics of the believers which are opposite of the characteristics of the hypocrites. This is like what is reported in the authentic Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÂíóÉõ ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞö ËóáóÇËñ: ÅöĞóÇ ÍóÏøóËó ßóĞóÈó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ æóÚóÏó ÃóÎúáóİó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÇÄúÊõãöäó ÎóÇä»</div><br>  (The signs of the hypocrites are three. When he speaks he lies, when he promises he breaks his promise, and when he is given a trust he behaves treacherously (with it).) In another narration it states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÍóÏøóËó ßóĞóÈó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÚóÇåóÏó ÛóÏóÑó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÎóÇÕóãó İóÌóÑ»</div><br>  (When he speaks he lies, when he makes a covenant he breaks it, and when he argues he is abusive.) Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú ÈöÔóåóÜÏóÊöåöã ŞóÇÆöãõæäó </div><br>  (And those who stand firm in their testimonies.) This means that they guard their testimonies. They do not add or decrease from what they testify to nor do they conceal their testimonies. Allah says in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóßúÊõãúåóÇ İóÅöäøóåõ ÁóÇËöãñ ŞóáúÈõåõ</div><br>  (Who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful.) (2:283) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú Úóáóì ÕóáÇóÊöåöãú íõÍóÇİöÙõæäó </div><br>  (And those who are with their Salah, Yuhafizun.) meaning, they maintain its proper times, its pillars, its obligations and its recommended acts. So Allah begins this discussion (of the believers' attributes) with prayer and He concludes it with prayer. This proves the importance of it and the praise of its noble status, just as what preceded at the beginning of Surat Al-Mu'minun. It is exactly the same discussion. This is why Allah says there (in Al-Mu'minun),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúæóÑöËõæäó - ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÑöËõæäó ÇáúİöÑúÏóæúÓó åõãú İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó </div><br>  (These are indeed the inheritors. Who shall inherit the Firdaws (Paradise). They shall dwell therein forever.) (23:10-11) And He says here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó İöì ÌóäøóÜÊò ãøõßúÑóãõæäó </div><br>  (Such shall dwell in the Gardens, honored.) meaning, they will be honored with various types of pleasures and delights.  </div></body></html>
