There is no reward for this with Allah. This is how this Ayah was interpreted by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, `Ikrimah, Muhammad bin Ka`b and Ash-Sha`bi. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÁÇÊóíúÊõãú ãøöä ÒóßóæÉò ÊõÑöíÏõæäó æóÌúåó Çááøóåö İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúãõÖúÚöİõæäó</div><br>  (but that which you give in Zakah seeking Allah's Face, then those they shall have manifold increase.) Those are the ones for whom Allah will multiply the reward.

He brings man forth from his mother's womb naked and knowing nothing, not able to see or hear, and having no strength. Then He provides him with all these things, giving him household effects, clothing, wealth, possessions and earnings.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó íõãöíÊõßõãú</div><br>  (then will cause you to die,) means, after this life.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó íõÍúíöíßõãú</div><br>  (then (again) He will give you life.) means, on the Day of Resurrection.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú ãöä ÔõÑóßóÂÆößõãú</div><br>  (Is there any of your partners) means, those whom you worship instead of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóä íóİúÚóáõ ãöä Ğóáößõãú ãøöä ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (that do anything of that) meaning, none of them are able to do any of that. But Allah is the One Who is Independent in His powers of creation, provision, and giving life and death. Then He will resurrect His creation on the Day of Resurrection. This is why, after all this He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓõÈúÍóÇäóåõ æóÊóÚóÇáóì ÚóãøóÇ íõÔúÑößõæäó</div><br>  (Glory be to Him!
