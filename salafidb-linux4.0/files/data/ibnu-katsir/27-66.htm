Say: "None in the heavens and the earth knows the Unseen except Allah, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.'') (66. Nay, their knowledge will perceive that in the Hereafter. Nay, they are in doubt about it. Nay, they are in complete blindness about it.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The One Who knows the Unseen is Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah commands His Messenger to inform all of creation that no one among the dwellers of heaven and earth knows the Unseen, except Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (except Allah) This is an absolute exception, meaning that no one knows this besides Allah, He is alone in that regard, having no partner in that knowledge. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚöäÏóåõ ãóİóÇÊöÍõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö áÇó íóÚúáóãõåóÂ ÅöáÇøó åõæó</div><br>  (And with Him are the keys of the Unseen, none knows them but He) (6:59).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÚöäÏóåõ Úöáúãõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö æóíõäóÒøöáõ ÇáúÛóíúËó</div><br>  (Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain) (31:34). until the end of the Surah. And there are many Ayat which mention similar things.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÔúÚõÑõæäó ÃóíøóÇäó íõÈúÚóËõæäó</div><br>  (nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.) That is, the created beings who dwell in the heavens and on earth do not know when the Hour will occur, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ËóŞõáóÊú İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö áÇó ÊóÃúÊöíßõãú ÅöáÇøó ÈóÛúÊóÉğ</div><br>  (Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden) (7: 187). meaning, it is a grave matter for the dwellers of heaven and earth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáö ÇÏóÑóßó Úöáúãõåõãú İöì ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö Èóáú åõãú İöì Ôóßøò ãøöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (Nay, their knowledge will perceive that in the Hereafter. Nay, they are in doubt about it.) means their knowledge and amazement stops short of knowing its time. Other scholars read this with the meaning "their knowledge is all the same with regard to that,'' which reflects the meaning of the Hadith in Sahih Muslim which states that the Messenger of Allah said to Jibril, when the latter asked him when the Hour would come: s   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÇáúãóÓúÄõæáõ ÚóäúåóÇ ÈöÃóÚúáóãó ãöäó ÇáÓøóÇÆöá»</div><br>  (The one who is being asked about it does not know any more than the one who is asking.) In other words, they were both equal in the fact that their knowledge did not extend that far.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú åõãú İöì Ôóßøò ãøöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (Nay, they are in doubt about it.) This refers to the disbelievers in general as Allah says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚõÑöÖõæÇú Úóáóì ÑóÈøößó ÕóİóÇ áøóŞóÏú ÌöÆúÊõãõæäóÇ ßóãóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÜßõãú Ãóæøóáó ãóÑøóÉò Èóáú ÒóÚóãúÊõãú Ãóáøóä äøóÌúÚóáó áóßõãú ãøóæúÚöÏğÇ </div><br>  (And they will be set before your Lord in rows, (and Allah will say:) "Now indeed, you have come to Us as We created you the first time. Nay, but you thought that We had appointed no meeting for you (with Us). '') (18:48) i.e., the disbelievers among you. By the same token, Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú åõãú İöì Ôóßøò ãøöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (Nay, they are in doubt about it.) meaning, they doubt that it will come to pass.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú åõã ãøöäúåóÇ Úóãõæäó</div><br>  (Nay, they are in complete blindness about it.) They are blind and completely ignorant about it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÃóÁöĞóÇ ßõäøóÇ ÊõÑóÇÈÇğ æóÁóÇÈóÂÄõäóÂ ÃóÁöäøóÇ áóãõÎúÑóÌõæäó - áóŞóÏú æõÚöÏúäóÇ åóÜĞóÇ äóÍúäõ æóÁóÇÈóÂÄõäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáõ Åöäú åóÜĞóÂ ÅöáÇøó ÃóÓóÜØöíÑõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó </div><br>  </div></body></html>
