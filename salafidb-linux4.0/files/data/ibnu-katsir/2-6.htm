Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.)  </div>Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieve) meaning, covered the truth and hid it. Since Allah has written that they would do so, it does not matter if you (O Muhammad ) warn them or not, they would still have disbelieved in what you were sent with. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÍóŞøóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó - æóáóæú ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãú ßõáøõ ÁÇíóÉò ÍóÊøóì íóÑóæõÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáÇøñáöíãó </div><br>  (Truly, those against whom the Word (wrath) of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful torment) (10:96-97).  About the rebellious People of the Book, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöäú ÃóÊóíúÊó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó Èößõáøö ÁóÇíóÉò ãøóÇ ÊóÈöÚõæÇú ŞöÈúáóÊóßó</div><br>  (And even if you were to bring to the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) all the Ayat, they would not follow your Qiblah (prayer direction)) (2:5).  These Ayat indicate that whomever Allah has written to be miserable, they shall never find anyone to guide them to happiness, and whomever Allah directs to misguidance, he shall never find anyone to guide him. So do not pity them - O Muhammad - deliver the Message to them. Certainly, whoever among them accepts the Message, then he shall gain the best rewards. As for those who turn away in rejection, do not feel sad for them or concerned about them, for   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóãóÇ Úóáóíúßó ÇáúÈóáóÜÛõ æóÚóáóíúäóÇ ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈõ</div><br>  (Your duty is only to convey (the Message) and on Us is the reckoning) (13: 40), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóäÊó äóĞöíÑñ æóÇááøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò æóßöíáñ</div><br>  (But you are only a warner. And Allah is a Wakil (Disposer of affairs, Trustee, Guardian) over all things) (11:12).  `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÓóæóÂÁñ Úóáóíúåöãú ÁóÃóäĞóÑúÊóåõãú Ãóãú áóãú ÊõäĞöÑúåõãú áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you (O Muhammad ) warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe) "That the Messenger of Allah was eager for all the people to believe and follow the guidance he was sent with. Allah informed him that none would believe except for those whom He decreed happiness for in the first place, and none would stray except those who Allah has decreed to do so in the first place.''  </div></body></html>
