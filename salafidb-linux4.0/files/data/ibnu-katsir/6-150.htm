They said, surely, Allah has full knowledge of the Shirk we indulge in, and that we forbid some kinds of wealth. Allah is able to change this Shirk by directing us to the faith, - they claimed - and prevent us from falling into disbelief, but He did not do that. Therefore - they said Allah indicated that He willed, decided and agreed that we do all this. They said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ ãóÂ ÃóÔúÑóßúäóÇ æóáÇóÍóÑøóãúäóÇ ãöä ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  ("If Allah had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything.")

Similar is mentioned in Surat An-Nahl. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó ßóĞøóÈó ÇáøóĞöíäó ãöä ŞóÈúáöåöãú</div><br>  (Likewise belied those who were before them,) for by using and relying on this understanding, the misguided ones before them were led astray. This notion is false and ungrounded, for had it been true, Allah would not have harmed them, destroyed them, aided His honorable Messengers over them, and made them taste His painful punishment.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åóáú ÚöäÏóßõã ãøöäú Úöáúãò</div><br>  (Say: "Have you any knowledge...") that Allah is pleased with you and with your ways,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊõÎúÑöÌõæåõ áóäóÂ</div><br>  (that you can produce before us.) and make it plain, apparent and clear for us.

Allah said to His Prophet   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú</div><br>  (Say) O Muhammad, to them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáöáøóåö ÇáúÍõÌøóÉõ ÇáúÈóÜáöÛóÉõ</div><br>  ("With Allah is the perfect proof and argument. ..") the perfect wisdom and unequivocal proof to guide whom He wills and misguide whom He wills.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóæú ÔóÂÁó áóåóÏóÇßõãú ÃóÌúãóÚöíäó</div><br>  (had He so willed, He would indeed have guided you all.) All of this happens accordng to His decree, His will, and His choice. So in this way, He is pleased with the believers, and angry with the disbelievers.
