When the Messenger called them to rid their hearts of that and to worship Allah Alone, this was too much for them and they were astounded by it.

Ibn Jarir said, "The Tawhid to which Muhammad is calling you is something by which he wishes to gain power over you, and exalt his own position, so that he will have followers among you, but we will not respond to him.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reason for the Revelation of These Ayat</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Abu Ja`far bin Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "When Abu Talib fell sick, some of the people of the Quraysh, including Abu Jahl, entered upon him and said, `Your brother's son is insulting our gods; he does such and such and says such and such. Why don't you send for him and tell him not to do that' So he sent for the Prophet and he entered the house. There was space enough for one man to sit between them and Abu Talib, and Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him, was afraid that if the Prophet  were to sit beside Abu Talib he would be more lenient with him, so he jumped up and sat in that spot, and the Messenger of Allah could find nowhere to sit near his uncle, so he sat by the door. Abu Talib said to him, `O son of my brother, why are your people complaining about you and claiming that you insult their gods and say such and such' They made so many complaints against him. Thereupon, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ Úóãøö Åöäøöí ÃõÑöíÏõåõãú Úóáóì ßóáöãóÉò æóÇÍöÏóÉò íóŞõæáõæäóåóÇ ÊóÏöíäõ áóåõãú ÈöåóÇ ÇáúÚóÑóÈõ¡ æóÊõÄóÏøöí Åöáóíúåöãú ÈöåóÇ ÇáúÚóÌóãõ ÇáúÌöÒúíóÉ»</div><br>  (O uncle, all I want from them is one word which, if they say it, the Arabs will become their followers and the non-Arabs will pay Jizyah to them.) They were worried about what he said, so they said, `One word Yes, by your father, (we will say) ten words!

This is the wording of Abu Kurayb.

Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "`We have not heard of this from the religion of these later days (meaning Christianity); if this Qur'an were true, the Christians would have told us about it.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäú åóÜĞóÇ ÅöáÇøó ÇÎúÊöáÇóŞñ</div><br>  (This is nothing but an invention!)

When they said this, it indicated their ignorance and lack of understanding since they thought it was unlikely that the Qur'an would be revealed to the Messenger and not to somebody else.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóá áøóãøóÇ íóĞõæŞõæÇú ÚóĞóÇÈö</div><br>  (Nay, but they have not tasted (My) torment!) means, they say this because they have not yet tasted the punishment and vengeance of Allah. But they will come to know the consequences of what they say and what they rejected on the Day when they are herded into the fire of Hell. Then Allah points out that He is the One Who is in control of His Creation and Who does whatever He wills, Who gives whatever He wants to whomever He wants, and honors whomever He wants and humiliates whomever He wants, and guides whomever He wants and misguides whomever He wants, and sends the Ruh (Jibril) by His command upon whomsoever He wants among His servants, and seals the hearts of whomever He wants, so no one can guide him apart from Allah. His servants do not possess any power and have no control over His dominion, not even a speck of dust's weight; they do not possess even a thin membrane over a date stone.

Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and others said, "The ways to the heaven.'' Ad-Dahhak, said, "Then let them ascend into the seventh heaven.''
