The word Qada normally having the meaning of decree here means "commanded''. Mujahid said that   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõÖöìó</div><br>  (And He has Qada) means enjoined. This is also how Ubayy bin Ka`b, Ibn Mas`ud and Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim recited the Ayah as:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóæóÕøóì ÑóÈøõßó ÃóáøóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæÇ ÅöáøóÇ ÅöíøóÇå»</div><br>  "And your Lord has Wassa enjoined that you worship none but Him.'' The idea of worshipping Allah is connected to the idea of honoring one's parents. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈöÇáúæóáöÏóíúäö ÅöÍúÓóÇäğÇ</div><br>  (And that you be dutiful to your parents.) Here He commands good treatment of parents, as He says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäö ÇÔúßõÑú áöì æóáöæóáöÏóíúßó Åöáóìøó ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ</div><br>  (give thanks to Me and to your parents.

When Allah forbids speaking and behaving in an obnoxious manner, He commands speaking and behaving in a good manner, so He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõá áøóåõãóÇ ŞóæúáÇğ ßóÑöíãğÇ</div><br>  (but address them in terms of honor.) meaning gently, kindly, politely, and with respect and appreciation.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÎúİöÖú áóåõãóÇ ÌóäóÇÍó ÇáĞøõáøö ãöäó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÉö</div><br>  (And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy,) means, be humble towards them in your actions.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõá ÑøóÈøö ÇÑúÍóãúåõãóÇ ßóãóÇ ÑóÈøóíóÇäöì ÕóÛöíÑğÇ</div><br>  (and say: "My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.'') means, say this when they grow old and when they die. Ibn `Abbas said: "But then Allah revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ßóÇäó áöáäøóÈöìøö æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú Ãóä íóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõæÇú áöáúãõÔúÑößöíäó</div><br>  (It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah's forgiveness for the idolators. ..)'' 9:13 There are many Hadiths which speak about honoring one's parents, such as the Hadith narrated through a number of chains of narration from Anas and others, which states that the Prophet climbed up on the Minbar, and then said, ((Amin, Amin, Amin.))

He said, "Say Amin,'' so I said Amin. Then he said, "He is doomed who sees the month of Ramadan come and go, and he has not been forgiven.'' He said, "Say Amin,'' so I said Amin. Then he said, "He is doomed who grows up and both his parents or one of them are still alive, and they do not cause him to enter Paradise.'' He said, "Say Amin,'' so I said Amin.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Hadith Imam Ahmad reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said:</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑóÛöãó Ãóäúİõ¡ Ëõãøó ÑóÛöãó Ãóäúİõ Ëõãøó ÑóÛöãó Ãóäúİõ ÑóÌõáò ÃóÏúÑóßó ÃóÍóÏó ÃóÈóæóíúåö Ãóæú (ßöáóíúåöãóÇ) ÚöäúÏó ÇáúßöÈóÑö æóáóãú íóÏúÎõáö ÇáúÌóäøóÉ»</div><br>  (He is doomed, he is doomed, he is doomed, the man whose parents, one or both of them, reach old age while he is alive and he does not enter Paradise.)

He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóåóáú áóßó ãöäú Ãõã»</div><br>  (Do you have a mother) He said, "Yes.''
