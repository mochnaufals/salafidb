Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóæúÇú ÊöÌóÜÑóÉğ Ãóæú áóåúæÇğ ÇäİóÖøõæÇú ÅöáóíúåóÇ æóÊóÑóßõæßó ŞóÂÆöãÇğ</div><br>  (And when they see some merchandise or some amusement, they disperse headlong to it, and leave you standing.) meaning, on the Minbar, delivering the Khutbah. Several of the Tabi`in said this, such as Abu Al-`Aliyah, Al-Hasan, Zayd bin Aslam and Qatadah. Muqatil bin Hayyan said that the caravan belonged to Dihyah bin Khalifah before he became a Muslim, and there were drums accompanying it.So they rushed to the caravan and left Allah's Messenger standing on the Minbar. Only a few remained, according to the authentic Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir said, "Once, a caravan arrived at Al-Madinah while Allah's Messenger was giving a Khutbah. So, the people left, and only twelve men remained with the Messenger . Then Allah sent down this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóæúÇú ÊöÌóÜÑóÉğ Ãóæú áóåúæÇğ ÇäİóÖøõæÇú ÅöáóíúåóÇ</div><br>  (And when they see some merchandise or some amusement, they disperse headlong to it,)'' The Two Sahihs also recorded this Hadith. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóßõæßó ŞóÂÆöãÇğ</div><br>  (And leave you standing.) proves that the Imam should deliver the speech on Friday while standing. In his Sahih, Imam Muslim recorded that Jabir bin Samurah said, "(During Jumu`ah,) the Prophet gave two speeches, and he used to sit between them. The Prophet would recite the Qur'an and remind the people (of Allah).'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ãóÇ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Say: "That which Allah has...'') means the reward that is with Allah in the Hereafter,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóíúÑñ ãøöäó Çááøóåúæö æóãöäó ÇáÊøöÌóÜÑóÉö æóÇááøóåõ ÎóíúÑõ ÇáÑóÒöŞöíäó</div><br>  (is better than any amusement or merchandise! And Allah is the best of providers.) means, for those who trust in Him and seek His provisions when they are allowed to do so. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Jumu`ah. All praise and thanks are due to Allah and from Him comes the success and immunity from error.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
