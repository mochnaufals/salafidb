So, when the disbelievers rejoice with the life of the present world that was given to them, they do not know that they are being tested and tried.

Imam Muslim also collected this Hadith in his Sahih. In another Hadith, the Prophet passed by a dead sheep, whose ears were small, and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇááåö áóáÏøõäúíóÇ Ãóåúæóäõ Úóáóì Çááåö ãöäú åóĞóÇ Úóáóì Ãóåúáöåö Íöíäó ÃóáúŞóæå»</div><br>  (By Allah! The life of this present world is as insignificant to Allah as this sheep was to its owners when they threw it away.)  </div></body></html>
