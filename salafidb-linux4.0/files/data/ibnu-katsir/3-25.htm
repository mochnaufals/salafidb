This censure and criticism from Allah was all because of their defiance and rejection. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú ŞóÇáõæÇú áóä ÊóãóÓøóäóÇ ÇáäøóÇÑõ ÅöáÇó ÃóíøóÇãğÇ ãøóÚúÏõæÏóÊò</div><br>  (This is because they say: "The Fire shall not touch us but for a number of days.'') meaning, what made them dare to challenge and defy the truth is their false claim that Allah will only punish them for seven days in the Fire, a day for every one thousand years in this life. We mentioned this subject in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Baqarah.  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÛóÑøóåõãú İöì Ïöíäöåöã ãøóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóİúÊóÑõæäó</div><br>  (And that which they used to invent regarding their religion has deceived them.) meaning, what caused them to remain on their false creed is that they deceived themselves, believing that the Fire will only touch them for a few days for their errors. However, it is they who have invented this notion, and Allah did not grant them authority to support this claim. Allah said, while threatening and warning them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóíúİó ÅöĞóÇ ÌóãóÚúäóÜåõãú áöíóæúãò áÇøó ÑóíúÈó İöíåö</div><br>  (How (will it be) when We gather them together on the Day about which there is no doubt (i. e. the Day of Resurrection).) meaning, what will their condition be like after they have uttered this lie about Allah, rejected His Messengers and killed His Prophets and their scholars who enjoined righteousness and forbade evil Allah will ask them about all this and punish them for what they have done. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóíúİó ÅöĞóÇ ÌóãóÚúäóÜåõãú áöíóæúãò áÇøó ÑóíúÈó İöíåö</div><br>  (How (will it be) when We gather them together on the Day about which there is no doubt.) meaning, there is no doubt that this Day will come,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæõİøöíóÊú ßõáøõ äóİúÓò ãøóÇ ßóÓóÈóÊú æóåõãú áÇó íõÙúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (And each person will be paid in full what he has earned And they will not be dealt with unjustly.).  </div></body></html>
