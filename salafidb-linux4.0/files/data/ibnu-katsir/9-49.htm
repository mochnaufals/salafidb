And among them is he who says: "Grant me leave and put me not into trial.'' Surely, they have fallen into trial. And verily, Hell is surrounding the disbelievers.)  Allah says, some hypocrites say to you, O Muhammad ,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÆúĞóä áøöí</div><br>  (Grant me leave), to stay behind,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóİúÊöäøöì</div><br>  (and put me not into trial.), if I go with you and see the women of the Romans. Allah, the Exalted, replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇ İöì ÇáúİöÊúäóÉö ÓóŞóØõæÇú</div><br>  5(Surely, they have fallen into trial) because of the statement they uttered. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Az-Zuhri, Yazid bin Ruwman, `Abdullah bin Abi Bakr, `Asim bin Qatadah and several others that they said, "The Messenger of Allah said to Al-Jadd bin Qays from Bani Salimah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åóáú áóßó íóÇ ÌóÏøõ ÇáúÚóÇãó İöí ÌóáóÇÏö Èóäöí ÇáúÃóÕúİóÑö¿»</div><br>  (`Would you like to fight the yellow ones (Romans) this year) He said, `O Allah's Messenger! Give me permission (to remain behind) and do not cause Fitnah for me. By Allah! My people know that there is not a man who is more fond of women than I. I fear that if I see the women of the yellow ones, I would not be patient.' The Messenger of Allah turned away from him and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÏú ÃóĞöäúÊõ áóß»</div><br>  (I give you permission.) In Al-Jadd's case, this Ayah was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäúåõãú ãøóä íóŞõæáõ ÇÆúĞóä áøöí æóáÇó ÊóİúÊöäøöì</div><br>  (And among them is he who says: "Grant me leave and put me not into trial.'') Therefore, Allah says that the Fitnah that he fell into because of not joining the Messenger of Allah (in Jihad) and preferring his safety to the safety of the Messenger is worse than the Fitnah that he falsely claimed to fear.'' It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others that this Ayah was revealed in the case of Al-Jadd bin Qays, who was among the chiefs of Bani Salimah. It is also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah asked,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÓóíøöÏõßõãú íóÇ Èóäöí ÓóáóãóÉó¿»</div><br>  (Who is your chief, O Bani Salamah) They said, "Al-Jadd bin Qays, although we consider him a miser.'' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÃóíøõ ÏóÇÁò ÃóÏúæóÃõ ãöäó ÇáúÈõÎúáö æóáóßöäú ÓóíøöÏõßõãú ÇáúİóÊóì ÇáúÌóÚúÏõ ÇáúÃóÈúíóÖõ ÈöÔúÑõ Èúäõ ÇáúÈóÑóÇÁö Èúäö ãóÚúÑõæÑ»</div><br>  (There is not a disease worse than stinginess! Therefore, your chief is the white young man with curly hair, Bishr bin Al-Bara' bin Ma'rur.) Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó Ìóåóäøóãó áóãõÍöíØóÉñ ÈöÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (And verily, Hell is surrounding the disbelievers.) and they will never be able to avoid, avert, or escape from it.  </div></body></html>
