He felt this way, especially since he was enjoying kingship, authority and power, so he cried and revealed his true identity to them when he asked them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú ÚóáöãúÊõãú ãøóÇ İóÚóáúÊõã ÈöíõæÓõİó æóÃóÎöíåö ÅöĞú ÃóäÊõãú ÌóÜåöáõæäó</div><br>  (Do you know what you did with Yusuf and his brother, when you were ignorant) meaning, `when you separated between Yusuf and his brother,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ÃóäÊõãú ÌóÜåöáõæäó</div><br>  (when you were ignorant) He said, `What made you do this is your ignorance of the tremendous sin you were about to commit.' It appears, and Allah knows best, that Yusuf revealed his identity to his brothers only then by Allah's command, just as he hid his identity from them in the first two meetings, by Allah's command. When the affliction became harder, Allah sent His relief from that affliction, just as He said He does,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøó ãóÚó ÇáúÚõÓúÑö íõÓúÑÇğ - Åöäøó ãóÚó ÇáúÚõÓúÑö íõÓúÑÇğ </div><br>  (Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.)94:5-6 This is when they said to Yusuf,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁöäøóßó áÇøäÊó íõæÓõİõ</div><br>  (Are you indeed Yusuf), in amazement, because they had been meeting him for more than two years while unaware of who he really was. Yet, he knew who they were and hid this news from them. Therefore, they asked in astonishment,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁöäøóßó áÇøäÊó íõæÓõİõ ŞóÇáó ÃóäóÇú íõæÓõİõ æóåóÜĞóÇ ÃóÎöì</div><br>  (Are you indeed Yusuf He said: "I am Yusuf, and this is my brother...'')  Yusuf said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ãóäøó Çááøóåõ ÚóáóíúäóÂ</div><br>  `(Allah has indeed been gracious to us.) by gathering us together after being separated all this time,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ãóä íóÊøóŞö æóíöÕúÈöÑú İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íõÖöíÚõ ÃóÌúÑó ÇáúãõÍúÓöäöíäóŞóÇáõæÇú ÊóÇááøóåö áóŞóÏú ÂËóÑóßó Çááøóåõ ÚóáóíúäóÇ</div><br>  ("Verily, he who has Taqwa, and is patient, then surely, Allah makes not the reward of the gooddoers to be lost.'' They said: "By Allah! Indeed Allah has preferred you above us.'') They affirmed Yusuf's virtue above them, being blessed with beauty, conduct, richness, kingship, authority and, above all, prophethood. They admitted their error and acknowledged that they made a mistake against him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó áÇó ÊóËúÑóíÈó Úóáóíúßõãõ Çáúíóæúãó</div><br>  (He said: "No reproach on you this day.'') He said to them, `There will be no blame for you today or admonishment, and I will not remind you after today of your error against me.' He then multiplied his generosity by invoking Allah for them for mercy,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÛúİöÑõ Çááøóåõ áóßõãú æóåõæó ÃóÑúÍóãõ ÇáÑóÍöãöíäó</div><br>  (may Allah forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!)  </div></body></html>
