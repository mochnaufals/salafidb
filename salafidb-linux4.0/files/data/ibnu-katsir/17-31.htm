The people of Jahiliyyah would not allow their daughters to inherit from them, and some would even kill their daughters lest they make them more poor. Allah forbade that and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóŞúÊõáõæÇú ÃóæúáÇÏóßõãú ÎóÔúíóÉó ÅöãúáóÜŞò</div><br>  (And kill not your children for fear of poverty.) meaning, lest they may make you poor in the future. This is why Allah mentions the children's provision first:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äøóÍúäõ äóÑúÒõŞõßõãú æóÅöíøóÇåõãú</div><br>  (We shall provide for them as well as for you.) In Surat Al-An`am, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóŞúÊõáõæÇú ÃóæúáóÜÏóßõãú ãøöäú ÅãúáóÜŞò</div><br>  (kill not your children because of poverty.) 6:151   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äøóÍúäõ äóÑúÒõŞõåõãú æóÅöíøóÇßõã</div><br>  (We provide sustenance for you and for them) 6:151 and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åäøó ŞóÊúáóåõãú ßóÇäó ÎöØúÆğÇ ßóÈöíÑğÇ</div><br>  (Surely, the killing of them is a great sin.) means, a major sin. In Two Sahihs it is recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said: "I said, `O Messenger of Allah, which sin is the worst' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóäú ÊóÌúÚóáó áöáøåö äöÏøğÇ æóåõæó ÎóáóŞóßó .

I asked, `Then what' He said, (To kill your child lest he should eat with you.) I asked, `Then what' He said, (To commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.)''  </div></body></html>
