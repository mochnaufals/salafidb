So if you turn away, still I have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will make another people succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. Surely, my Lord is Guardian over all things.) (58. And when Our commandment came, We saved Hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us, and We saved them from a severe torment.) (59. Such were the people of `Ad. They rejected the Ayat of their Lord and disobeyed His Messengers, and followed the command of every proud, obstinate (oppressor of the truth from their leaders).) (60. And they were pursued by a curse in this world and (so they will be) on the Day of Resurrection. No doubt! Verily, `Ad disbelieved in their Lord. So away with `Ad, the people of Hud.) Hud says to them, "If you turn away from that which I have brought to you in reference to worship of Allah, Who is your Lord alone, without any partners, then the proof has been established against you. This is because I have conveyed the Message of Allah to you, which He has sent me with.''</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÊóÎúáöİõ ÑóÈøöì ŞóæúãğÇ ÛóíúÑóßõãú</div><br>  (My Lord will make another people succeed you, ) This refers to a group of people who will worship Allah alone, without associating anything with Him. This also implies that the polytheists do not bother Allah and they do not harm Him in the least with their disbelief. To the contrary, their disbelief merely harms their own selves.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÑóÈøöì Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ÍóİöíÙñ</div><br>  (Surely, my Lord is Guardian over all things.) This means that Allah is a Witness and Guardian over the statements of His servants and their actions. He will give them due recompense for their actions. If they do good deeds, He will reward them with good. If they do evil, He will punish them with evil. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Destruction of the People of `Ad and the Salvation of Those among Them Who believed</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁó ÃóãúÑõäóÇ</div><br>  (And when Our commandment came,) This is referring to the barren wind with which Allah destroyed them, to the very last of them. The mercy and kindness of Allah, the Exalted saved Hud and his followers from this terrible punishment.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İæóÊöáúßó ÚóÇÏñ ÌóÍóÏõæÇú ÈöÂíóÜÊö ÑóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  g(Such were `Ad (people). They rejected the Ayat of their Lord)  This means they disbelieved in the proofs and revelations (of Allah) and they disobeyed the Messengers of Allah. This is due to the fact that whoever disbelieves in a Prophet, then verily, he has disbelieved in all of the Prophets, peace be upon them. There is no difference between any one of them, in the sense that it is necessary to believe in all of them. Therefore, `Ad disbelieved in Hud and their disbelief was considered disbelief in all of the Messengers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóÈóÚõæÇú ÃóãúÑó ßõáøö ÌóÈøóÇÑò ÚóäöíÏò</div><br>  (and followed the command of every proud, obstinate.) This means that they abandoned following their rightly guided Messenger and they followed the command of every proud, obstinate person. Thus, they were followed in this life by a curse from Allah and His believing servants whenever they are mentioned. On the Day of Resurrection a call will be made against them in front of witnesses.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇ Åöäøó ÚóÇÏğÇ ßóİóÑõæÇú ÑóÈøóåõãú</div><br>  (Verily, `Ad disbelieved in their Lord.)  </div></body></html>
