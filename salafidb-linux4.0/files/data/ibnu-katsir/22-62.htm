Possessor of the power, You give power to whom You will, and You take power from whom You will, and You endue with honor whom You will, and You humiliate whom You will. In Your Hand is the good. Verily, You are able to do all things. You make the night to enter into the day, and You make the day to enter into the night, You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living. And You give wealth and sustenance to whom You will, without limit.) 3:26-27 The meaning of "merging'' the night into the day and the day into the night is that the one encroaches upon the other, and vice versa. Sometimes the night is long and the day is short, as in winter, and sometimes the day is long and the night is short, as in summer.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó Çááøóåó ÓóãöíÚñ ÈóÕöíÑñ</div><br>  (And verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer.)
