Ibn Jurayj said that the Jews asked the Messenger to cause books to come down to them addressed to so-and-so among them, testifying to the truth of what he was sent with. The Jews only asked for this because of their stubbornness, defiance, rejection and disbelief. The disbelievers of Quraysh also asked for similar things from the Prophet, as is mentioned in Surat Al-Isra',   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú áóä äøõÄúãöäó áóßó ÍóÊøóì ÊóİúÌõÑó áóäóÇ ãöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö íóäúÈõæÚğÇ </div><br>  (And they say: "We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us;) (17:90) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóÏú ÓóÃóáõæÇú ãõæÓóì ÃóßúÈóÑó ãöä Ğáößó İóŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóÑöäóÇ Çááøóåö ÌóåúÑóÉğ İóÃóÎóĞóÊúåõãõ ÇáÕøóÜÚöŞóÉõ ÈöÙõáúãöåöãú</div><br>  (Indeed, they asked Musa for even greater than that, when they said, "Show us Allah in public,'' but they were struck with a bolt of lightning for their wickedness.) injustice, transgression, defiance and rebellion.

(2:55,56) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÇÊøóÎóĞõæÇú ÇáúÚöÌúáó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãõ ÇáúÈóíøöäóÜÊõ</div><br>  (Then they worshipped the calf even after Al-Bayyinat had come to them.) meaning, after they witnessed the tremendous miracles and unequivocal proofs at the hand of Musa in Egypt. They also witnessed the demise of their enemy, Fir`awn and his soldiers, when they all drowned in the sea. Yet soon after, when they passed by a people who were worshipping idols, they said to Musa,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÌúÚóáú áøóäóÂ ÅöáóÜåğÇ ßóãóÇ áóåõãú ÁóÇáöåóÉñ</div><br>  (Make for us a god as they have gods.) Allah explains the story of the Jews worshipping the calf in Surat Al-A`raf (7) and Surah Ta Ha (20) after Musa went to meet with his Lord. When Musa returned, Allah decreed that in order for the Jews to earn accepted repentance, then those who did not worship the calf would have to kill those who worshipped it. They complied with this command, and Allah resurrected them afterwards. Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÚóİóæúäóÇ Úóä Ğáößó æóÁóÇÊóíúäóÇ ãõæÓóì ÓõáúØóÜäÇğ ãøõÈöíäÇğ</div><br>  ((Even) so We forgave them.

So Allah raised the mountain above their heads and they were ordered to prostrate, which they did. Even so, they were looking above when they were prostrating for fear that the mountain might fall on them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞ äóÊóŞúäóÇ ÇáúÌóÈóáó İóæúŞóåõãú ßóÃóäøóåõ ÙõáøóÉñ æóÙóäøõæÇú Ãóäøóåõ æóÇŞöÚñ Èöåöãú ÎõĞõæÇú ãóÂ ÁóÇÊóíúäóÇßõã ÈöŞõæøóÉò</div><br>  (And (remember) when We raised the mountain over them as if it had been a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall on them.

They were commanded to enter Bayt Al-Quds (in Jerusalem) while bowing and saying "Hittah'', meaning: `O Allah! take from us our sin of abandoning Jihad.' This was the cause of their wandering in the desert of Tih for forty years. Yet, they entered the House while crawling on their rear ends and saying `Hintah (a wheat grain) in Sha`rah (the hair)'.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõáúäóÇ áóåõãú áÇó ÊóÚúÏõæÇú İöì ÇáÓøóÈúÊö</div><br>  (and We commanded them, "Transgress not the Sabbath (Saturday).'') meaning, We commanded them to honor the Sabbath and honor what Allah prohibited them on that day.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÎóĞúäóÇ ãöäúåõãú ãøöíËóÜŞÇğ ÛóáöíÙÇğ</div><br>  t(And We took from them a firm covenant.) meaning, strong covenant.
