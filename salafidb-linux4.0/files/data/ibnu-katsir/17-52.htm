Ibn Ishaq narrated from Ibn Abi Najih from Mujahid: "I asked Ibn `Abbas about that, and he said: `This is death.''' `Atiyah reported that Ibn `Umar explained of this Ayah: "If you were dead I would still resurrect you.'' This was also the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Salih, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others. This means that if you were to assume that you would become dead, which is the opposite of living, Allah will resurrect you when He wills, for nothing can stop Him when He wills a thing.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÎóáúŞğÇ ãøöãøóÇ íóßúÈõÑõ İöì ÕõÏõæÑößõãú</div><br>  (Or some created thing that is yet greater (or harder) in your breasts.)

This view expressed by Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah is what the Arabs understand from the language, because the word used Fasayunghidun indicates an up-and-down movement Nughad. A word derived from the same root, Naghd, is used to refer to the young of the ostrich, because when it walks, it walks quickly and moves its head. The same word is used to describe a tooth when it becomes loose and is detached from its place.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæäó ãóÊóì åõæó</div><br>  (and say: "When will that be'') This shows that they thought it very unlikely that it would happen, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæäó ãóÊóì åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúæóÚúÏõ Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó </div><br>  (And they say: "When will this promise (i.e. Resurrection) be fulfilled, if you are truthful'') (36:48)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõ ÈöåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it the Hour) 42:18   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÚóÓóì Ãóä íóßõæäó ŞóÑöíÈğÇ</div><br>  (Say: "Perhaps it is near!'') meaning, beware of it, for it is at hand and will no doubt come to you, and what will be will be.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÏúÚõæßõãú</div><br>  (On the Day when He will call you,) meaning the Lord, may He be blessed and exalted:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÏóÚóÇßõãú ÏóÚúæóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöĞóÂ ÃóäÊõãú ÊóÎúÑõÌõæäó</div><br>  (When He will call you by a single call, behold, you will come out from the earth) 30:25 meaning, when He commands you to come out from the earth, for nothing can oppose Him or prevent His command from being fulfilled.

(79:13-14), meaning, it will be just one definitive command, then the people will have come out from the inside of the earth to its surface, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÏúÚõæßõãú İóÊóÓúÊóÌöíÈõæäó ÈöÍóãúÏöåö</div><br>  (On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with (words of) His praise) meaning, you will all rise up in response to His command and in obedience to His will.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÙõäøõæäó</div><br>  (and you will think) means, on the Day when you rise up from your graves,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä áøóÈöËúÊõãú</div><br>  (that you have stayed) in this earthly abode,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ŞóáöíáÇğ</div><br>  (but a little while.)
