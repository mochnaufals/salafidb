This is something that is absolutely necessary and there is no avoiding it. This has been reported in authentic Hadiths of the Messenger of Allah in various different ways. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÍóÈøó ÚóÈúÏğÇ ÏóÚóÇ ÌöÈúÑöíáó¡ İóŞóÇáó: íóÇ ÌöÈúÑöíáõ¡ Åöäøöí ÃõÍöÈøõ İõáóÇäğÇ İóÃóÍöÈøóåõ ŞóÇáó: İóíõÍöÈøõåõ ÌöÈúÑöíáõ¡ ŞóÇáó: Ëõãøó íõäóÇÏöí İöí Ãóåúáö ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö: Åöäøó Çááåó íõÍöÈøõ İõáóÇäğÇ İóÃóÍöÈøõæåõ¡ ŞóÇáó: İóíõÍöÈøõåõ Ãóåúáõ ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö¡ Ëõãøó íõæÖóÚõ áóåõ ÇáúŞóÈõæáõ İöí ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ æóÅöäøó Çááåó ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÈúÛóÖó ÚóÈúÏğÇ ÏóÚóÇ ÌöÈúÑöíáó İóŞóÇáó: íóÇ ÌöÈúÑöíáõ Åöäøöí ÃõÈúÛöÖõ İõáóÇäğÇ İóÃóÈúÛöÖúåõ¡ ŞóÇáó: İóíõÈúÛöÖõåõ ÌöÈúÑöíáõ¡ Ëõãøó íõäóÇÏöí İöí Ãóåúáö ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö: Åöäøó Çááåó íõÈúÛöÖõ İõáóÇäğÇ İóÃóÈúÛöÖõæåõ¡ ŞóÇáó: İóíõÈúÛöÖõåõ Ãóåúáõ ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö¡ Ëõãøó íõæÖóÚõ áóåõ ÇáúÈóÛúÖóÇÁõ İöí ÇáúÃóÑúÖ»</div><br>  (Verily, whenever Allah loves a servant of His, He calls Jibril and says, "O Jibril, verily I love so-and-so, so love him.'' Thus, Jibril will love him. Then, he (Jibril) will call out to the dwellers of the heavens, "Verily, Allah loves so-and-so, so you too must love him.'' Then the dwellers of the heavens love him and he will be given acceptance in the earth. Whenever Allah hates a servant of His, He calls Jibril and says, "O Jibril, verily I hate so-and-so, so hate him.'' Thus, Jibril will hate him. Then, he (Jibril) will call out amongst the dwellers of the heavens, "Verily, Allah hates so-and-so, so you too must hate him.'' Then the dwellers of the heavens hate him and hatred for him will be placed in the earth.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported narrations similar to this. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÍóÈøó Çááåõ ÚóÈúÏğÇ äóÇÏóì ÌöÈúÑöíáó: Åöäøöí ŞóÏú ÃóÍúÈóÈúÊõ İõáóÇäğÇ İóÃóÍöÈøóåõ¡ İóíõäóÇÏöí İöí ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö¡ Ëõãøó íõäúÒöáõ áóåõ ÇáúãóÍóÈøóÉó İöí Ãóåúáö ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ İóĞóáößó Şóæúáõ Çááåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÇÊö ÓóíóÌúÚóáõ áóåõãõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ æõÏøÇğ </div><br>  (Whenever Allah loves a servant of His, He calls Jibril (saying), "Verily, I love so-and-so, so love him.'' Then, Jibril calls out into the heavens and love for him descends among the people of the earth. That is the meaning of the statement of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime: (Verily, those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Gracious will bestow love for them.)) 19:96 This was also reported by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi and At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Qur'an descended to give Glad Tidings and to warn</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóãóÇ íóÓøóÑúäóÜåõ</div><br>  (So, We have made this easy) meaning the Qur'an.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöáóÓóÇäößó</div><br>  (in your own tongue,) This is an address to Prophet Muhammad and it means that the Qur'an is in the pure, complete and eloquent Arabic language.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöÊõÈóÔøöÑó Èöåö ÇáúãõÊøóŞöíäó</div><br>  (that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa,) those who respond to Allah and believe in His Messenger ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊõäúĞöÑó Èöåö ŞóæúãÇğ áøõÏøÇğ</div><br>  (and warn with it the people who are Ludda.) meaning, the people who have deviated away from the truth and are inclined towards falsehood. His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóãú ÃóåúáóßúäóÇ ŞóÈúáóåõãú ãøöä ŞóÑúäò</div><br>  (And how many a generation before them have We destroyed!) means from the nations that disbelieved in the signs of Allah and rejected His Messengers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú ÊõÍöÓøõ ãöäúåõãú ãøöäú ÃóÍóÏò Ãóæú ÊóÓúãóÚõ áóåõãú ÑößúÒÇğ</div><br>  (Can you find a single one of them or hear even a whisper of them) Meaning, `have you seen any of them or even heard a whisper from them.' Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd all said, "This means any sound.'' Al-Hasan and Qatadah both said that this means, "Do you see with your eye, or hear any sound'' This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Maryam. All praises and thanks are due to Allah. Following this will be the Tafsir of Surah Ta Ha, Allah willing and all praise is due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
