Some of the Arabs believed that the angels were the daughters of Allah, but Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>”х»ъЌу«дуех »убъ Џц»у«ѕс гшхяъ—угхжду</div><br>  (Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) meaning, the angels are servants of Allah who are honored by Him and who hold high positions of noble status. They obey Him to the utmost in all their words and deeds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>б«у ну”ъ»цёхждуех »ц«бъёужъбц жуехгъ »ц√угъ—цец нуЏъгубхжду </div><br>  (They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His command.) meaning, they do not initiate any matter before Him or go against His commands; on the contrary, they hasten to do as He commands, and He encompasses them with His knowledge so that nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>нуЏъбугх гу« »унъду √унъѕцнецгъ жугу« ќубъЁуехгъ</div><br>  (He knows what is before them, and what is behind them,)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жуб«у ну‘ъЁуЏхжду ≈цб«шу бцгудц «—ъ у÷ум</div><br>  (and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased.) This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>гуд –у« «бшу–цм ну‘ъЁуЏх Џцдѕуех ≈цб«шу »ц≈ц–ъдцец</div><br>  (Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission) 2:255   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жуб«у  удЁуЏх «б‘шуЁу№Џу…х Џцдѕуех ≈цб«шу бцгудъ √у–цду буех</div><br>  (Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits) 34:23. There are many Ayat which say similar things.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>жуехгъ гшцдъ ќу‘ъну цец</div><br>  (And they for fear of Him) means, because they fear Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>гх‘ъЁцёхждужугуд нуёхбъ гцдъехгъ ≈цдшцм ≈цбу№ес гшцд ѕхждцец</div><br>  (And they stand in awe. And if any of them should say: "Verily, I am a god besides Him,'') meaning, whoever claims to be a god instead of Allah, i.e., alongside Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ёу–бцяу дућъ“цнец ћуеудшугу яу–убцяу дућъ“цм «бўшу№бцгцнду</div><br>  (such We should recompense with Hell. Thus We recompense the wrongdoers.) meaning, everyone who says this. This is a conditional sentence, and the condition stated does not necessarily have to take place. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ёхбъ ≈цд яу«ду бцб—шуЌъгу№дц жубуѕс Ёу√уду«ъ √ужшубх «бъЏу№»цѕцнду </div><br>  (Say: "If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of worshippers.'') 43:81   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>бу∆цдъ √у‘ъ—уяъ у бунуЌъ»уЎудшу Џугубхяу жубу уяхждудшу гцду «бъќу№”ц—цнду</div><br>  (If you join others in worship with Allah, (then) surely, (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.) 39:65  </div></body></html>
