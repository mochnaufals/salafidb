They combine glorification (Tasbih) which implies that He is free of any shortcomings, with praise (Tahmid) which is an affirmation of praise.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÄúãöäõæäó Èöåö</div><br>  (and believe in Him,) means, they humbly submit themselves before Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÊóÛúİöÑõæäó áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú</div><br>  (and ask forgiveness for those who believe) means, for those among the people of earth who believe in the Unseen. Allah commanded that His angels who are close to Him should pray for the believers in their absence, so it is a part of the angels' nature that they say Amin when a believer prays for his brother in his absence. In Sahih Muslim it says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÏóÚóÇ ÇáúãõÓúáöãõ áöÃóÎöíåö ÈöÙóåúÑö ÇáúÛóíúÈö ŞóÇáó Çáúãóáóßõ: Âãöíäó æóáóßó ÈöãöËúáöå»</div><br>  (When a Muslim prays for his brother in his absence, the angel says, `Amin, and may you have something similar to it'.)'' Shahr bin Hawshab said, "The bearers of the Throne are eight; four of them say, `Glory and praise be to You, O Allah, to You be praise for Your forebearance after Your knowledge. ' Four of them say, `Glory and praise be to You, O Allah, to You be praise for Your forgiveness after Your power.' When they pray for forgiveness for those who believe, they say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÓöÚúÊó ßõÜáøó ÔóìúÁò ÑøóÍúãóÉğ æóÚöáúãÇğ</div><br>  (Our Lord!

That is, `forgive the sinners when they repent to You and turn to You and give up their former ways, following Your commands to do good and abstain from evil.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞöåöãú ÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáúÌóÍöíãö</div><br>  (and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire!) means, `snatch them away from the punishment of Hell, which is a painful, agonizing punishment.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÃóÏúÎöáúåõãú ÌóäøóÜÊö ÚóÏúäò ÇáøóÊöì æóÚóÏúÊøóåõãú æóãóä ÕóÜáóÍó ãöäú ÁóÇÈóÂÆöåöãú æóÃóÒúæóÌöåöãú æóĞõÑøöíøóÜÊöåöãú</div><br>  (Our Lord! And make them enter the `Adn (Eternal) Gardens which you have promised them -- and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring!) meaning, `bring them together so that they may find delight in one another in neighboring dwellings. ' This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÇÊøóÈóÚóÊúåõãú ĞõÑøöíøóÊõåõã ÈöÅöíãóÜäò ÃóáúÍóŞúäóÇ Èöåöãú ĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõãú æóãóÂ ÃóáóÊúäóÜåõãú ãøöäú Úóãóáöåöã ãøöä ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  (And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything)(52:21). This means, `that all of them will be made equal in status. In this way they may delight in one another's company; the one who is in the higher status will not lose anything. On the contrary We will raise the one whose deeds are of a lower status so that they will become equal, as a favor and a blessing from Us.' Sa`id bin Jubayr said that when the believer enters Paradise, he will ask where his father, son and brother are. It will be said to him, `they did not reach the same level of good deeds as you did'. He will say, `but I did it for my sake and for theirs.' Then they will be brought to join him in that higher degree. Then Sa`id bin Jubayr recited this Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÃóÏúÎöáúåõãú ÌóäøóÜÊö ÚóÏúäò ÇáøóÊöì æóÚóÏúÊøóåõãú æóãóä ÕóÜáóÍó ãöäú ÁóÇÈóÂÆöåöãú æóÃóÒúæóÌöåöãú æóĞõÑøöíøóÜÊöåöãú Åöäøóßó ÃóäÊó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÍóßöíãõ </div><br>  (Our Lord!

Mutarrif bin `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir said, "The most sincere of the servants of Allah towards the believers are the angels.'' Then he recited this Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÃóÏúÎöáúåõãú ÌóäøóÜÊö ÚóÏúäò ÇáøóÊöì æóÚóÏúÊøóåõãú</div><br>  (Our Lord!
