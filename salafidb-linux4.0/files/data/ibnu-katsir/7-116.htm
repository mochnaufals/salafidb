They said: "O Musa! Either you throw (first), or shall we have the (first) throw'') (116. He Musa said: "Throw you (first).'' So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great trick.)  The magicians challenged Musa, when they said,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöãøóÂ Ãóä ÊõáúŞöìó æóÅöãøóÂ Ãóä äøóßõæäó äóÍúäõ ÇáúãõáúŞöíäó</div><br>  (Either you throw (first), or shall we have the (first) throw) before you.

It was said that the wisdom behind asking them to throw first, is that - Allah knows best - the people might witness the magicians' sorcery first. When the magicians had cast their spell and captured the eyes, the clear and unequivocal truth came, at a time when they all anticipated and waited for it to come, thus making the truth even more impressive to their hearts. This is what happened. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÂ ÃóáúŞõæúÇú ÓóÍóÑõæÇú ÃóÚúíõäó ÇáäøóÇÓö æóÇÓúÊóÑúåóÈõæåõãú</div><br>  (So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them,) meaning, they deceived the eyes and made them think that thet trick was real, when it was only an illusion, just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóæúÌóÓó İöì äóİúÓöåö ÎöíİóÉğ ãøõæÓóì - ŞõáúäóÇ áÇó ÊóÎóİú Åöäøóßó ÃóäÊó ÇáÇøñÚúáóì - æóÃóáúŞö ãóÇ İöì íóãöíäößó ÊóáúŞóİú ãóÇ ÕóäóÚõæÇú ÅöäøóãóÇ ÕóäóÚõæÇú ßóíúÏõ ÓóÇÍöÑò æóáÇó íõİúáöÍõ ÇáÓøóÜÍöÑõ ÍóíúËõ ÃóÊóì </div><br>  (So Musa conceived fear in himself. We (Allah) said: "Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand. And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a magician's trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain'') 20:67-69. Ibn `Abbas commented that the magicians threw, "Thick ropes and long sticks, and they appeared to be crawling, an illusion that they created with their magic.''  </div></body></html>
