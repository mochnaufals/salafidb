This is also among the favors that Allah granted His servant and Messenger, `Isa, accepting his request to send the Ma'idah down, and doing so as clear proof and unequivocal evidence. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ŞóÇáó ÇáúÍóæóÇÑöíøõæäó</div><br>  ((Remember) when Al-Hawaryun said...) the disciples of `Isa said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäó ãóÑúíóãó åóáú íóÓúÊóØöíÚõ ÑóÈøõßó</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä íõäóÒøöáó ÚóáóíúäóÇ ãóÂÆöÏóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö</div><br>  (O `Isa, son of Maryam! Can your Lord send down to us a Ma'idah from heaven) The Ma'idah is the table that has food on it. Some scholars said that the disciples requested this table because they were poor and deprived. So they asked `Isa to supplicate to Allah to send a table of food down to them that they could eat from every day and thus be more able to perform the acts of worship.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó Åöä ßõäÊõã ãøõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  (`Isa said: "Have Taqwa of Allah, if you are indeed believers.'')  `Isa answered them by saying, `Have Taqwa of Allah!

As-Suddi commented that the Ayah means, "We will take that day on which the table was sent down as a day of celebration, that we and those who come after us would consider sacred.'' Sufyan Ath-Thawri said that it means, "A day of prayer.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇíóÉğ ãøöäúßó</div><br>  (and a sign from You. ) proving that You are able to do all things and to accept my supplication, so that they accept what I convey to them from You,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÑúÒõŞúäóÇ</div><br>  (and provide us sustenance,) a delicious food from You that does not require any effort or hardship,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÊó ÎóíúÑõ ÇáÑøóÇÒöŞöíäóŞóÇáó Çááøóåõ Åöäøöì ãõäóÒøöáõåóÇ Úóáóíúßõãú İóãóä íóßúİõÑú ÈóÚúÏõ ãöäßõãú</div><br>  ("For You are the Best of sustainers.''

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "They said to `Isa, son of Maryam, `Supplicate to Allah to send down to us from heaven, a table spread with food.' He also said, `So the angels brought the table down containing seven fish and seven pieces of bread and placed it before them. So the last group of people ate as the first group did.'' Ibn Jarir recorded that Ishaq bin `Abdullah said that the table was sent down to `Isa son of Maryam having seven pieces of bread and seven fish, and they ate from it as much as they wished. But when some of them stole food from it, saying, "It might not come down tomorrow,'' the table ascended. These statements testify that the table was sent down to the Children of Israel during the time of `Isa, son of Maryam, as a result of Allah's accepting his supplication to Him. The apparent wording of this Ayah also states so,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó Çááøóåõ Åöäøöì ãõäóÒøöáõåóÇ Úóáóíúßõãú</div><br>  (Allah said: "I am going to send it down unto you...'') 5:115.  </div></body></html>
