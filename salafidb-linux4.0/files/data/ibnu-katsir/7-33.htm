And none likes praise more than Allah).  This was also recorded in the Two Sahihs. In the explanation of Surat Al-An`am, we explained the Fahishah that is committed openly and in secret. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÅöËúãó æóÇáúÈóÛúìó ÈöÛóíúÑö ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (and Ithm, and transgression without right,) 7:33. As-Suddi commented, "Al-Ithm means, `disobedience'. As for unrighteous oppression, it occurs when you transgress against people without justification.'' Mujahid said, "Ithm includes all types of disobedience. Allah said that the oppressor commits oppression against himself.'' Therefore, the meaning of, Ithm is the sin that one commits against himself, while `oppression' pertains to transgression against other people, and Allah prohibited both.
