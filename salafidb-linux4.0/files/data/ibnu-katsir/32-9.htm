Malik said, narrating from Zayd bin Aslam:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÃóÍúÓóäó ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò ÎóáóŞóåõ</div><br>  (Who made everything He has created good) means, "He created everything well and in a goodly fashion.'' When Allah mentions the creation of the heavens and the earth, He follows that by mentioning the creation of man. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóÏóÃó ÎóáúŞó ÇáÅöäúÓóÜäö ãöä Øöíäò</div><br>  (and He began the creation of man from clay.) meaning, He created the father of mankind, Adam, from clay.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÌóÚóáó äóÓúáóåõ ãöä ÓõáÇóáóÉò ãøöä ãøóÂÁò ãøóåöíäò </div><br>  (Then He made his offspring from semen of despised water.) means, they reproduce in this fashion, from a Nutfah which comes from the loins of men and from between the ribs of women.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÓóæøóÇåõ</div><br>  (Then He fashioned him in due proportion,) means, when He created Adam from clay, He created him and gave him shape and made him upright.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóİóÎó İöíåö ãöä ÑøõæÍöåö æóÌóÚóáó áóßõãõ ÇáÓøóãúÚó æóÇáÇøñÈúÕóÜÑó æóÇáÇøñİúÆöÏóÉó</div><br>  (and breathed into him the soul; and He gave you hearing, sight and the sense of deduction.) means, reason.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóáöíáÇğ ãøóÇ ÊóÔúßõÑõæäó</div><br>  (Little is the thanks you give!) means, for these strengths with which Allah has provided you; the one who is truly blessed is the one who uses them to worship and obey his Lord, may He be exalted and glorified.  </div></body></html>
