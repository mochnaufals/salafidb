O you who believe! Spend of that with which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers.)</div>  Allah commands His servants to spend for His sake, in the path of righteousness, from what He has granted them, so that they acquire and keep the reward of this righteous deed with their Lord and King. Let them rush to perform this deed in this life,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä íóÃúÊöìó íóæúãñ</div><br>  (before a Day comes) meaning, the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó ÈóíúÚñ İöíåö æóáÇó ÎõáøóÉñ æóáÇó ÔóİóÜÚóÉñ</div><br>  (when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession.)  This Ayah indicates that on that Day, no one will be able to bargain on behalf of himself or ransom himself with any amount, even if it was the earth's fill of gold; nor will his friendship or relation to anyone benefit him. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ äõİöÎó İöì ÇáÕøõæÑö İóáÇó ÃóäÓóÜÈó Èóíúäóåõãú íóæúãóÆöĞò æóáÇó íóÊóÓóÂÁóáõæäó </div><br>  (Then, when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another) 23:101.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÔóİóÜÚóÉñ</div><br>  (Nor intercession) meaning, they will not benefit by the intercession of anyone.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó åõãõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãõæäó</div><br>  (and it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers) indicates that no injustice is worse than meeting Allah on that Day while a disbeliever. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ata' bin Dinar said, "All thanks are due to Allah Who said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó åõãõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãõæäó</div><br>  (and it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers) but did not say, `And it is the wrongdoers who are the disbelievers.'''  </div></body></html>
