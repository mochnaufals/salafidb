And remember your ungratefulness for what We granted you. Remember how you asked Musa to exchange this type of food for an inferior type that consists of vegetation, and so forth.'' Al-Hasan Al-Basri said about the Children of Israel, "They were bored and impatient with the type of food they were provided. They also remembered the life they used to live, when their diet consisted of lentils, onions, garlic and herbs.''

They said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóì ØóÚóÇãò æóÍöÏò</div><br>  (One kind of food) meaning, the manna and quails, because they ate the same food day after day. The Ayah mentioned lentils, onions and herbs, which are all known types of foods. As for the Fum, Ibn Mas`ud read it, Thum (garlic). Also, Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Al-Hasan said about the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİõæãöåóÇ</div><br>  (Its Fum), "Ibn `Abbas said that Fum means, garlic.''  He also said that the expression, `Fumu-lanna' means, `bake for us', according to the languages of old. Ibn Jarir commented, "If this is true, then `Fum' is one of the words whose pronounciation were altered, the letter `fa' was replaced by the letter `tha', since they are similar in sound.'' And Allah knows best. Others said that Fum is wheat, the kind used for bread. Al-Bukhari said, "Some of them said that Fum includes all grains or seeds that are eaten.''  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÃóÊóÓúÊóÈúÏöáõæäó ÇáøóĞöì åõæó ÃóÏúäóì ÈöÇáøóĞöì åõæó ÎóíúÑñ</div><br>  (He said, "Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower'') criticized the Jews for asking for inferior foods, although they were living an easy life, eating tasty, beneficial and pure food. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇåúÈöØõæÇú ãöÕúÑğÇ</div><br>  (Go you down to any Misr) means, `any city', as Ibn `Abbas said. Ibn Jarir also reported that Abu Al-`Aliyah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that the Ayah refers to Misr, the Egypt of Fir`awn. The truth is that the Ayah means any city, as Ibn `Abbas and other scholars stated. Therefore, the meaning of Musa's statement to the Children of Israel becomes, "What you are asking for is easy, for it is available in abundance in any city that you might enter. So since what you asked for is available in all of the villages and cities, I will not ask Allah to provide us with it, especially when it is an inferior type of food. '' This is why Musa said to them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊóÓúÊóÈúÏöáõæäó ÇáøóĞöì åõæó ÃóÏúäóì ÈöÇáøóĞöì åõæó ÎóíúÑñ ÇåúÈöØõæÇú ãöÕúÑğÇ İóÅöäøó áóßõã ãøóÇ ÓóÃóáúÊõãú</div><br>  (Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want!)  Since their request was the result of boredom and arrogance and since fulfilling it was unnecessary, their request was denied.

And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. That was because they used to disbelieve in the Ayat (proofs, evidence) of Allah and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allah, i.e. commit crimes and sins.)) (2:61) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Covering the Jews in Humiliation and Misery</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÖõÑöÈóÊú Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáĞøöáøóÉõ æóÇáúãóÓúßóäóÉõ</div><br>  (And they were covered with humiliation and misery). This Ayah indicates that the Children of Israel were plagued with humiliation, and that this will continue, meaning that it will never cease. They will continue to suffer humiliation at the hands of all who interact with them, along with the disgrace that they feel inwardly. Al-Hasan commented, "Allah humiliated them, and they shall have no protector. Allah put them under the feet of the Muslims, who appeared at a time when the Majus (Zoroastrians) were taking the Jizyah (tax) from the Jews.'' Also, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and As-Suddi said that `misery' used in the Ayah means, `poverty.' `Atiyah Al-`Awfi said that `misery' means, `paying the tilth (tax).' In addition, Ad-Dahhak commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóÂÁõæÇ ÈöÛóÖóÈò ãøöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (and they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah), "They deserved Allah's anger.'' Also, Ibn Jarir said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóÂÁõæÇ ÈöÛóÖóÈò ãøöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (and they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah) means, "They went back with the wrath. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì ÃõÑöíÏõ Ãóä ÊóÈõæÁó ÈöÅöËúãöì æóÅöËúãößó</div><br>  (Verily, I intend to let you draw my sin on yourself as well as yours) (Al-Ma'idah 5:29) meaning, `You will end up carrying my, and your, mistakes instead of me'. Thus, the meaning of the Ayah becomes, `They went back carrying Allah's anger; Allah's wrath descended on them; they deserved Allah's anger.'''  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú ßóÇäõæÇú íóßúİõÑõæäó ÈöÂíóÜÊö Çááøóåö æóíóŞúÊõáõæäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó ÈöÛóíúÑö ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (That was because they used to disbelieve in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, etc.) of Allah and killed the Prophets wrongfully.) means, "This is what We rewarded the Children of Israel with: humiliation and misery.'' Allah's anger that descended on the Children of Israel was a part of the humiliation they earned, because of their defiance of the truth, disbelief in Allah's Ayat and belittling the carriers of Allah's Law i.e. the Prophets and their following. The Children of Israel rejected the Messengers and even killed them. Surely, there is no form of disbelief worse than disbelieving in Allah's Ayat and murdering the Prophets of Allah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Meaning of Kibr</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Similarly, in a Hadith recorded in the Two Sahihs the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúßöÈúÑõ ÈóØóÑõ ÇáúÍóŞøö æóÛóãúØõ ÇáäøóÇÓ»</div><br>  (`Kibr, is refusing the truth and degrading (belittling) people.)  Imam Ahmad recorded, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud saying that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÔóÏøõ ÇáäøóÇÓö ÚóĞóÇÈğÇ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÑóÌõáñ ŞóÊóáóåõ äóÈöíøñ Ãóæú ŞóÊóáó äóÈöíøğÇ: æóÅöãóÇãõ ÖóáóÇáóÉò æóãõãóËøöáñ ãöäó ÇáúãõãóËøöáöíä»</div><br>  (The people who will receive the most torment on the Day of Resurrection are: a man who was killed by a Prophet or who killed a Prophet, an unjust ruler and one who mutilates (the dead).) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó ÈöãóÇ ÚóÕóæÇú æøóßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúÊóÏõæäó</div><br>  (That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds) mentions another reason why the Children of Israel were punished in this manner, for they used to disobey and transgress the limits. Disobedience is to do what is prohibited, while transgression entails overstepping the set limits of what is allowed and what is prohibited. Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
