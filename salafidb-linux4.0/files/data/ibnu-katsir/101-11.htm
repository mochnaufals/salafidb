This is like Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÃóäøóåõãú ÌóÑóÇÏñ ãøõäÊóÔöÑñ</div><br>  (As if they were locusts spread abroad.) (54:7) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóßõæäõ ÇáúÌöÈóÇáõ ßóÇáúÚöåúäö ÇáúãóäİõæÔö </div><br>  (And the mountains will be like wool, carded.) meaning, they will become like carded wool that has began to wear out (fade away) and be torn apart. Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi have all said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇáúÚöåúäö</div><br>  (like wool (`Ihn). ) "Woolen.'' Then Allah informs about the results received by those who performed the deeds, and the honor and disgrace they will experience based upon their deeds. He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóãøóÇ ãóä ËóŞõáóÊú ãóæóÒöíäõåõ </div><br>  (Then as for him whose Balance will be heavy.) meaning, his good deeds are more than his bad deeds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåõæó İöì ÚöíÔóÉò ÑøóÇÖöíóÉò </div><br>  (He will live a pleasant life.) meaning, in Paradise.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóãøóÇ ãóäú ÎóİøóÊú ãóæóÒöíäõåõ </div><br>  (But as for him whose Balance will be light.) meaning, his bad deeds are more than his good deeds. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃõãøõåõ åóÇæöíóÉñ </div><br>  (His mother will be Hawiyah.) It has been said that this means he will be falling and tumbling headfirst into the fire of Hell, and the expression `his mother' has been used to refer to his brain (as it is the mother of his head). A statement similar to this has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Abu Salih and Qatadah. Qatadah said, "He will fall into the Hellfire on his head.'' Abu Salih made a similar statement when he said, "They will fall into the Fire on their heads.'' It has also been said that it means his mother that he will return to and end up with in the Hereafter will be Hawiyah, which is one of the names of the Hellfire. Ibn Jarir said, "Al-Hawiyah is only called his mother because he will have no other abode except for it.'' Ibn Zayd said, "Al-Hawiyah is the Fire, and it will be his mother and his abode to which he will return, and where he will be settled.'' Then he recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÃúæóÇåõãõ ÇáäøóÇÑõ</div><br>  (Their abode will be the Fire.) (3:151) Ibn Abi Hatim said that it has been narrated from Qatadah that he said, "It is the Fire, and it is their abode.'' Thus, Allah says in explaining the meaning of Al-Hawiyah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÏúÑóÇßó ãóÇ åöíóåú </div><br>  (And what will make you know what it is). Allah's statement   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÇÑñ ÍóÇãöíóÉñ </div><br>  (A fire Hamiyah!) meaning, extreme heat. It is a heat that is accompanied by a strong flame and fire. It is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÇÑõ Èóäöí ÂÏóãó ÇáøóÊöí ÊõæŞöÏõæäó¡ ÌõÒúÁñ ãöäú ÓóÈúÚöíäó ÌõÒúÁğÇ ãöäú äóÇÑö Ìóåóäøóã»</div><br>  (The fire of the Children of Adam that you all kindle is one part of the seventy parts of the fire of Hell.) They (the Companions) said, "O Messenger of Allah! Isn't it sufficient'' He replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöäøóåóÇ İõÖøöáóÊú ÚóáóíúåóÇ ÈöÊöÓúÚóÉò æóÓöÊøöíäó ÌõÒúÁğÇ»</div><br>  (It is more than it by sixty-nine times.) This has been recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. In some of the wordings he stated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöäøóåóÇ İõÖøöáóÊú ÚóáóíúåóÇ ÈöÊöÓúÚóÉò æóÓöÊøöíäó ÌõÒúÁğÇ¡ ßõáøõåõäøó ãöËúáõ ÍóÑøöåóÇ»</div><br>  (It is more than it by sixty-nine times, each of them is like the heat of it.) It has been narrated in a Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Ãóåúæóäó Ãóåúáö ÇáäøóÇÑö ÚóĞóÇÈğÇ ãóäú áóåõ äóÚúáóÇäö¡ íóÛúáöí ãöäúåõãóÇ ÏöãóÇÛõå»</div><br>  (Verily, the person who will receive the lightest torment of the people of the Hellfire will be a man who will have two sandals that will cause his brain to boil. )'' It has been confirmed in the <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said,</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÔúÊóßóÊö ÇáäøóÇÑõ Åöáóì ÑóÈøöåóÇ İóŞóÇáóÊú: íóÇ ÑóÈøö Ãóßóáó ÈóÚúÖöí ÈóÚúÖğÇ¡ İóÃóĞöäó áóåóÇ ÈöäóİóÓóíúäö: äóİóÓò İöí ÇáÔøöÊóÇÁö¡ æóäóİóÓò İöí ÇáÕøóíúİö¡ İóÃóÔóÏøõ ãóÇ ÊóÌöÏõæäó İöí ÇáÔøöÊóÇÁö ãöäú ÈóÑúÏöåóÇ¡ æóÃóÔóÏøõ ãóÇ ÊóÌöÏõæäó İöí ÇáÕøóíúİö ãöäú ÍóÑøöåóÇ»</div><br>  (The Hellfire complained to its Lord and said, "O Lord! Some parts of me devour other parts of me.'' So He (Allah) permitted it to take two breaths: one breath in the winter and one breath in the summer. Thus, the most severe cold that you experience in the winter is from its cold, and the most severe heat that you experience in the summer is from its heat. ) In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÇÔúÊóÏøó ÇáúÍóÑøõ İóÃóÈúÑöÏõæÇ Úóäö ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö¡ İóÅöäøó ÔöÏøóÉó ÇáúÍóÑøö ãöäú İóíúÍö Ìóåóäøóã»</div><br>  (When the heat becomes intense pray the prayer when it cools down, for indeed the intense heat is from the breath of Hell.) This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qari`ah, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
