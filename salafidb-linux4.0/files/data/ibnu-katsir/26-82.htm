He is the Creator Who has decreed certain things to which He guides His creation, so each person follows the path which is decreed for him. Allah is the One Who guides whomsoever He wills and leaves astray whomsoever He wills.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöì åõæó íõØúÚöãõäöì æóíóÓúŞöíäö </div><br>  (And it is He Who feeds me and gives me to drink.) He is my Creator Who provides for me from that which He has made available in the heavens and on earth. He drives the clouds and causes water to fall with which He revives the earth and brings forth its fruits as provision for mankind. He sends down the water fresh and sweet so that many of those whom He has created, animals and men alike, may drink from it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÑöÖúÊõ İóåõæó íóÔúİöíäö </div><br>  (And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me.) Here he attributed sickness to himself, even though it is Allah Who decrees it, out of respect towards Allah. By the same token, Allah commands us to say in the prayer,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇåúÏöäóÇ ÇáÕøöÑóÇØó ÇáúãõÓúÊóŞöíãó </div><br>  (Guide us to the straight way) (1:6) to the end of the Surah. Grace and guidance are attributed to Allah, may He be exalted, but the subject of the verb with reference to anger is omitted, and going astray is attributed to the people. This is like when the Jinn said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøóÇ áÇó äóÏúÑöì ÃóÔóÑøñ ÃõÑöíÏó Èöãóä İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö Ãóãú ÃóÑóÇÏó Èöåöãú ÑóÈøõåõãú ÑóÔóÏÇğ </div><br>  (And we know not whether evil is intended for those on earth, or whether their Lord intends for them a right path) (72:10) Similarly, Ibrahim said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÑöÖúÊõ İóåõæó íóÔúİöíäö </div><br>  (And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me.) meaning, `when I fall sick, no one is able to heal me but Him, Who heals me with the means that may lead to recovery'.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöì íõãöíÊõäöì Ëõãøó íõÍúíöíäö </div><br>  (And Who will cause me to die, and then will bring me to life.) He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and no one besides Him is able to do that, for He is the One Who originates and repeats.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöì ÃóØúãóÚõ Ãóä íóÛúİöÑó áöì ÎóØöíÆóÊöì íóæúãó ÇáÏøöíäö </div><br>  (And Who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of Recompense.) means, no one is able to forgive sins in this world or the Hereafter except Him. Who can forgive sins except Allah For He is the One Who does whatever He wills.  </div></body></html>
