This conditional phrase does not mean that what is described could happen nor that is possible as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóæú ÃóÑóÇÏó Çááøóåõ Ãóä íóÊøóÎöĞó æóáóÏÇğ áÇøóÕúØóİóì ãöãøóÇ íóÎúáõŞõ ãóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ ÓõÈúÍóÜäóåõ åõæó Çááøóåõ ÇáúæóÍöÏõ ÇáúŞóåøóÇÑõ </div><br>  (Had Allah willed to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed out of those whom He created.

Exalted be He from all that they ascribe (to Him).) meaning, exalted and sanctified and glorified be the Creator of all things far above having any offspring, for He is Unique, One and Eternally Self-Sufficient. There is none equal to Him or like Him, and He does not have any offspring.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞóÑúåõãú íóÎõæÖõæÇú</div><br>  (So leave them (alone) to speak nonsense) means, in their ignorance and misguidance,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóáúÚóÈõæÇú</div><br>  (and play) in their world,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì íõáóÜŞõæÇú íóæúãóåõãõ ÇáøóĞöì íõæÚóÏõæäó</div><br>  (until they meet the Day of theirs which they have been promised.) which is the Day of Resurrection, i.e., then they will come to know what their end and destination will be on that Day. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Uniqueness of the Lord</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì İöì ÇáÓøóãÂÁö ÅöáóÜåñ æóİöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöáóÜåñ</div><br>  (It is He Who is the only God in the heaven and the only God on the earth.) means, He is the God of those who are in the heavens and the God of those who are on earth; all of them worship Him and are humbled before Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáúÍóßöíãõ ÇáúÚóáöíãõ</div><br>  (And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.)

(6:3) which means, He is the One who is called Allah in the heavens and on the earth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÈóÇÑóßó ÇáøóĞöì áóåõ ãõáúßõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóãóÇ ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ</div><br>  (And Blessed be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,) means, He is their Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is controlling them with none to resist or oppose His rule. Blessed and exalted be He far above the notion of His having a child. He is eternally free of all faults and shortcomings, because He is the Lord, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Sovereign of all things, Who is in control of all affairs.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚöäÏóåõ Úöáúãõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö</div><br>  (and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour, ) means, no one knows when it will happen except Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöáóíúåö ÊõÑúÌóÚõæäó</div><br>  (and to Whom you (all) will be returned.) means, and each person will be requited for his deeds; if they are good, then he will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then he will be punished. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Idols have no Power of Intercession</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóãúáößõ ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÏúÚõæäó ãöä Ïõæäöåö</div><br>  (And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power) means, the idols and false gods.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÔøóİóÜÚóÉó</div><br>  (of intercession) means, they are not able to intercede for them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóä ÔóåöÏó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö æóåõãú íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly, and they know.) This means, but the one who bears witness to the truth has knowledge and insight, so his intercession with Allah will avail, by His leave. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Idolators admit that Allah Alone is the Creator</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÆöä ÓóÃóáúÊóåõã ãøóäú ÎóáóŞóåõãú áóíóŞõæáõäøó Çááøóåõ İóÃóäøóì íõÄúİóßõæäó </div><br>  (And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: "Allah.''

Yet despite that they still worship others alongside Him who have nothing and are able to do nothing. This is the utmost foolishness and stupidity. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóäøóì íõÄúİóßõæäó</div><br>  (How then are they turned away) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Prophet's Complaint to Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞöíáöåö íÑóÈøö Åöäøó åóÜÄõáÇóÁö Şóæúãñ áÇøó íõÄúãöäõæäó </div><br>  (And his saying: "O my Lord! Verily, these are a people who believe not!'') means, Muhammad said this; he complained to his Lord about his people who did not believe in him, and said, `O Lord, these people do not believe.' This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ÇáÑøóÓõæáõ íÑóÈøö Åöäøó Şóæúãöì ÇÊøóÎóĞõæÇú åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÁÇóäó ãóåúÌõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (And the Messenger will say: "O my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an.'') (25:30). This is the view of Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid and Qatadah, and this is how Ibn Jarir interpreted it. Al-Bukhari said: "`Abdullah -- meaning Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him -- recited (Ayah 88 of Az-Zukhruf): (æóŞóÇáó ÇáÑøóÓõæáõ íÇÑÈøö) (And the Messenger will say: "O my Lord!'')

Qatadah said, "These are the words of your Prophet , when he complained about his people to his Lord.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÕúİóÍú Úóäúåõãú</div><br>  (So turn away from them, ) means, from the idolators.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõáú ÓóáóÜãñ</div><br>  (and say Salam (peace!)) means, `do not respond to them in the same evil manner in which they address you; but try to soften their hearts and forgive them in word and deed.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (But they will come to know.) This is a warning from Allah for them. His punishment, which cannot be warded off, struck them, and His religion and His word was supreme. Subsequently Jihad and striving were prescribed until the people entered the religion of Allah in crowds, and Islam spread throughout the east and the west. And Allah knows best. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Az-Zukhruf.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
