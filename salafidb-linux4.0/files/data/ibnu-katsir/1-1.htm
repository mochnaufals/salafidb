In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</div> <br> The scholars also agree that Bismillah is a part of an Ayah in Surat  An-Naml (chapter 27). They disagree over whether it is a separate Ayah  before every Surah, or if it is an Ayah, or a part of an Ayah,  included in every Surah where the Bismillah appears in its beginning.  Ad-Daraqutni also recorded a Hadith from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet  that supports this Hadith by Ibn Khuzaymah. Also, similar statements were  attributed to `Ali, Ibn `Abbas and others.  The opinion that Bismillah is an Ayah of every Surah, except  Al-Bara'ah (chapter 9), was attributed to (the Companions) Ibn `Abbas,  Ibn `Umar, Ibn Az-Zubayr, Abu Hurayrah and `Ali. This opinion was also attributed  to the Tabi`in: `Ata', Tawus, Sa`id bin Jubayr,  Makhul and Az-Zuhri. This is also the view of `Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak,  Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad bin Hanbal, (in one report from him) Ishaq  bin Rahwayh and Abu `Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Salam. On the other hand,  Malik, Abu Hanifah and their followers said that Bismillah is  not an Ayah in Al-Fatihah or any other Surah. Dawud said  that it is a separate Ayah in the beginning of every Surah, not part  of the Surah itself, and this opinion was also attributed to Ahmad bin  Hanbal. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Basmalah aloud in the Prayer</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  As for Basmalah aloud during the prayer, those who did not agree that it is a part of Al-Fatihah, state that the Basmalah should not be aloud. The scholars who stated that Bismillah is a part of every Surah (except chapter 9) had different opinions; some of them, such as Ash-Shafi`i, said that one should recite Bismillah with Al-Fatihah aloud. This is also the opinion of many among the Companions, the Tabi`in and the Imams of Muslims from the Salaf and the later generations. For instance, this is the opinion of Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Mu`awiyah, `Umar and `Ali - according to Ibn `Abdul-Barr and Al-Bayhaqi. Also, the Four Khalifahs - as Al-Khatib reported - were said to have held this view although the report from them is contradicted. The Tabi`in scholars who gave this Tafsir include Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Abu Qilabah, Az-Zuhri, `Ali bin Al-Hasan, his son Muhammad, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, `Ata', Tawus, Mujahid, Salim, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Abu Bakr bin Muhammad bin `Amr bin Hazm, Abu Wa'il, Ibn Sirin, Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir, `Ali bin `Abdullah bin `Abbas, his son Muhammad, Nafi` the freed slave of Ibn `Umar, Zayd bin Aslam, `Umar bin `Abdul-Aziz, Al-Azraq bin Qays, Habib bin Abi Thabit, Abu Ash-Sha`tha', Makhul and `Abdullah bin Ma`qil bin Muqarrin. Also, Al-Bayhaqi added `Abdullah bin Safwan, and Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah to this list. In addition, Ibn `Abdul-Barr added `Amr bin Dinar.  The proof that these scholars relied on is that, since Bismillah is a part of Al-Fatihah, it should be recited aloud like the rest of Al-Fatihah. Also, An-Nasa'i recorded in his Sunan, Ibn Hibban and Ibn Khuzaymah in their Sahihs and Al-Hakim in the Mustadrak, that Abu Hurayrah once performed the prayer and recited Bismillah aloud. After he finished the prayer, he said, "Among you, I perform the prayer that is the closest to the prayer of the Messenger of Allah .'' Ad-Daraqutni, Al-Khatib and Al-Bayhaqi graded this Hadith Sahih Furthermore, in Sahih Al-Bukhari it is recorded that Anas bin Malik was asked about the recitation of the Prophet . He said, "His recitation was unhurried.'' He then demonstrated that and recited, while lengthening the recitation of Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, Also, in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad, the Sunan of Abu Dawud, the Sahih of Ibn Hibban and the Mustadrak of Al-Hakim - it is recorded that Umm Salamah said, "The Messenger of Allah used to distinguish each Ayah during his recitation,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÓúãö Çááøóåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö - ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó - ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö - ãóÜáößö íóæúãö ÇáÏøöíäö </div><br>  (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The Owner of the Day of Recompense.)''  Ad-Daraqutni graded the chain of narration for this Hadith Sahih Furthermore, Imam Abu `Abdullah Ash-Shafi`i and Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak, recorded that Mu`awiyah led the prayer in Al-Madinah and did not recite the Bismillah. The Muhajirin who were present at that prayer criticized that. When Mu`awiyah led the following prayer, he recited the Bismillah aloud.  The Hadiths mentioned above provide sufficient proof for the opinion that the Bismillah is recited aloud. As for the opposing evidences and the scientific analysis of the narrations mentioned their weaknesses or otherwise it is not our desire to discuss this subject at this time.  Other scholars stated that the Bismillah should not be recited aloud in the prayer, and this is the established practice of the Four Khalifahs, as well as `Abdullah bin Mughaffal and several scholars among the Tabi`in and later generations. It is also the Madhhab (view) of Abu Hanifah, Ath-Thawri and Ahmad bin Hanbal.  Imam Malik stated that the Bismillah is not recited aloud or silently. This group based their view upon what Imam Muslim recorded that `A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah used to start the prayer by reciting the Takbir (Allahu Akbar; Allah is Greater) and then recite,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.) (Ibn Abi Hatim 1:12).  Also, the Two Sahihs recorded that Anas bin Malik said, "I prayed behind the Prophet , Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman and they used to start their prayer with,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.)  Muslim added, "And they did not mention,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÓúãö Çááøóåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö </div><br>  (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) whether in the beginning or the end of the recitation.'' Similar is recorded in the Sunan books from `Abdullah bin Mughaffal, may Allah be pleased with him.  These are the opinions held by the respected Imams, and their statements are similar in that they agree that the prayer of those who recite Al-Fatihah aloud or in secret is correct. All the favor is from Allah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Virtue of Al-Fatihah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad, that a person who was riding behind the Prophet said, "The Prophet's animal tripped, so I said, `Cursed Shaytan.' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóŞõáú: ÊóÚöÓó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäõ¡ İóÅöäøóßó ÅöĞóÇ ŞõáúÊó: ÊóÚöÓó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäõ¡ ÊóÚóÇÙóãó æóŞóÇáó: ÈöŞõæøóÊöí ÕóÑóÚúÊõåõ¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ŞõáúÊó: ÈöÇÓúãö Çááåö ÊóÕóÇÛóÑó ÍóÊì íóÕöíÑó ãöËúáó ÇáĞõÈóÇÈö»</div><br>  (Do not say, 'Cursed Shaytan,' for if you say these words, Satan becomes arrogant and says, 'With my strength I made him fall.' When you say, 'Bismillah,' Satan will become as small as a fly.)  Further, An-Nasa'i recorded in his book Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, and also Ibn Marduwyah in his Tafsir that Usamah bin `Umayr said, "I was riding behind the Prophet...'' and he mentioned the rest of the above Hadith. The Prophet said in this narration,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóŞõáú åßóĞóÇ İóÅöäøóåõ íóÊóÚóÇÙóãõ ÍóÊøóì íóßõæäó ßóÇáúÈóíúÊö¡ æóáßöäú Şõáú: ÈöÓúãö Çááåö¡ İóÅäøóåõ íóÕúÛóÑõ ÍóÊøóì íóßõæäó ßóÇáĞõÈóÇÈóÉö»</div><br>  (Do not say these words, because then Satan becomes larger; as large as a house. Rather, say, 'Bismillah,' because Satan then becomes as small as a fly.)  This is the blessing of reciting Bismillah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Basmalah is recommended before performing any Deed</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Basmalah (reciting Bismillah) is recommended before starting any action or deed. For instance, Basmalah is recommended before starting a Khutbah (speech).  The Basmalah is also recommended before one enters the place where he wants to relieve himself, there is a Hadith concerning this practice. Further, Basmalah is recommended at the beginning of ablution, for Imam Ahmad and the Sunan compilers recorded that Abu Hurayrah, Sa`id bin Zayd and Abu Sa`id narrated from the Prophet ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ æõÖõæÁó áöãóäú áóãú íóĞúßõÑö ÇÓúãó Çááåö Úóáóíúåö»</div><br>  (There is no valid ablution for he who did not mention Allah's Name in it.)  This Hadith is Hasan (good). Also, the Basmalah is recommended before eating, for Muslim recorded in his Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said to `Umar bin Abi Salamah while he was a child under his care,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Şõáú ÈöÓúãö Çááåö æóßõáú Èöíóãöíäößó æóßõáú ãöãøóÇ íóáöíßó»</div><br>  (Say Bismillah, eat with your right hand and eat from whatever is next to you.)  Some of the scholars stated that Basmalah before eating is obligatory. Basmalah before having sexual intercourse is also recommended. The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú Ãóäøó ÃóÍóÏóßõãú ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÑóÇÏó Ãóäú íóÃúÊöíó Ãóåúáóåõ ŞóÇáó: ÈöÓúãö Çááåö Çááóåõãøó ÌóäøöÈúäóÇ ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäó æóÌóäøöÈö ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäó ãóÇ ÑóÒóŞúÊóäóÇ¡İóÅäøóåõ Åöäú íõŞóÏøóÑú ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ æóáóÏñ áóãú íóÖõÑøóåõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäõ ÃóÈóÏğÇ»</div><br>  (If anyone of you before having sexual relations with his wife says, 'In the Name of Allah. O Allah! Protect us from Satan and also protect what you grant us (meaning the coming offspring) from Satan,' and if it is destined that they should have a child then, Satan will never be able to harm that child.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of "Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah is the Name of the Lord, the Exalted. It is said that Allah is the Greatest Name of Allah, because it is referred to when describing Allah by the various attributes. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó ÚóÇáöãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÇáÔøóåóÜÏóÉö åõæó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ ÇáÑøóÍöíãõ - åõæó Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó Çáúãóáößõ ÇáúŞõÏøõæÓõ ÇáÓøóáóÜãõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõ Çáúãõåóíúãöäõ ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÌóÈøóÇÑõ ÇáúãõÊóßóÈøöÑõ ÓõÈúÍóÜäó Çááøóåö ÚóãøóÇ íõÔúÑößõæäó - åõæó Çááøóåõ ÇáúÎóÜáöŞõ ÇáúÈóÇÑöìÁõ ÇáúãõÕóæøöÑõ áóåõ ÇáÇøñÓúãóÂÁõ ÇáúÍõÓúäóì íõÓóÈøöÍõ áóåõ ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóåõæó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÍóßöíãõ </div><br>  (He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He) the Knower of the unseen and the seen.

Glory be to Allah! (High is He) above all that they associate as partners with Him. He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the Almighty, the Wise) (59:22-24).  Hence, Allah mentioned several of His Names as Attributes for His Name Allah. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóááøóåö ÇáÃóÓúãóÂÁõ ÇáúÍõÓúäóì İóÇÏúÚõæåõ ÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them) (7:180), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáö ÇÏúÚõæÇú Çááøóåó Ãóæö ÇÏúÚõæÇú ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäó ÃóíøğÇ ãøóÇ ÊóÏúÚõæÇú İóáóåõ ÇáÇøñÓúãóÂÁó ÇáúÍõÓúäóì</div><br>  (Say (O Muhammad :) "Invoke Allah or invoke the Most Gracious (Allah), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names.'') (17:110)  Also, the Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ááåö ÊöÓúÚóÉğ æóÊöÓúÚöíäó ÇÓúãğÇ¡ ãöÇÆóÉğ ÅöáóÇ æóÇÍöÏğÇ¡ ãóäú ÃóÍúÕóÇåóÇ ÏóÎóáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó»</div><br>  (Allah has ninety-nine Names, one hundred minus one, whoever counts (and preserves) them, will enter Paradise.)  These Names were mentioned in a Hadith recorded by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, and there are several differences between these two narrations. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim - the Most Gracious, the Most  Merciful</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim are two names derived from Ar-Rahmah (the mercy),  but Rahman has more meanings that pertain to mercy than Ar-Rahim.  There is a statement by Ibn Jarir that indicates that there is a consensus  on this meaning. Further, Al-Qurtubi said, "The proof that these names are  derived (from Ar-Rahmah), is what At-Tirmidhi recorded - and graded Sahih  from `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÇáó Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáì: ÃóäóÇ ÇáÑøóÍúãäõ ÎóáóŞúÊõ ÇáÑøóÍöãó æóÔóŞóŞúÊõ áóåóÇ ÇÓúãğÇ  ãöäö ÇÓúãöí¡ İóãóäú æóÕóáóåóÇ æóÕóáúÊõåõ æóãóäú ŞóØóÚóåÇ ŞóØóÚúÊõåõ»</div><br>  (Allah the Exalted said, 'I Am Ar-Rahman. I created the Raham (womb,  i.e. family relations) and derived a name for it from My Name. Hence, whoever  keeps it, I will keep ties to him, and whoever severs it, I will sever ties  with him.') He then said, "This is a text that indicates the derivation.''  He then said, "The Arabs denied the name Ar-Rahman, because of their ignorance  about Allah and His attributes.''  Al-Qurtubi said, "It was said that both Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim have  the same meaning, such as the words Nadman and Nadim, as Abu `Ubayd  has stated. Abu `Ali Al-Farisi said, `Ar-Rahman, which is exclusively  for Allah, is a name that encompasses every type of mercy that Allah  has. Ar-Rahim is what effects the believers, for Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÈöÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÑóÍöíãÇğ</div><br>  (And He is ever Rahim (merciful) to the believers.)' (33:43) Also, Ibn  `Abbas said - about Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim, `They are two soft  names, one of them is softer than the other (meaning it carries more implications  of mercy).'''  Ibn Jarir said; As-Surri bin Yahya At-Tamimi narrated to me that  `Uthman bin Zufar related that Al-`Azrami said about Ar-Rahman and  Ar-Rahim, "He is Ar-Rahman with all creation and Ar-Rahim with  the believers.'' Hence. Allah's statements,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÇÓúÊóæóì Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÑúÔö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ</div><br>  (Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His majesty),  Ar-Rahman) (25:59),) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÑúÔö ÇÓúÊóæóì </div><br>  (Ar-Rahman (Allah) rose over (Istawa) the (Mighty) Throne (in  a manner that suits His majesty).) (20:5)  Allah thus mentioned the Istawa - rising over the Throne - along with  His Name Ar-Rahman, to indicate that His mercy encompasses all of His creation.  Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÈöÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÑóÍöíãÇğ</div><br>  (And He is ever Rahim (merciful) to the believers), thus encompassing the  believers with His Name Ar-Rahim. They said, "This testifies to the fact  that Ar-Rahman carries a broader scope of meanings pertaining to the mercy  of Allah with His creation in both lives. Meanwhile, Ar-Rahim is exclusively  for the believers.'' Yet, we should mention that there is a supplication that  reads,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÑóÍúãäó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÇáúÂÎöÑóÉö æóÑóÍöíãóåõãóÇ»</div><br>  (The Rahman and the Rahim of this life and the Hereafter)  Allah's Name Ar-Rahman is exclusively His. For instance, Allah  said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáö ÇÏúÚõæÇú Çááøóåó Ãóæö ÇÏúÚõæÇú ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäó ÃóíøğÇ ãøóÇ ÊóÏúÚõæÇú İóáóåõ  ÇáÇøñÓúãóÂÁó ÇáúÍõÓúäóì</div><br>  (Say (O Muhammad ): "Invoke Allah or invoke Ar-Rahman (Allah),  by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best  Names) (17:110),) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúÆáú ãóäú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ãöä ÑøõÓõáöäóÂ ÃóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ãöä Ïõæäö  ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÁóÇáöåóÉğ íõÚúÈóÏõæäó </div><br>  (And ask (O Muhammad ) those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: "Did  We ever appoint alihah (gods) to be worshipped besides Ar-Rahman (Most  Gracious, Allah)'') (43:45).  Further, when Musaylimah the Liar called himself the Rahman of Yamamah,  Allah made him known by the name `Liar' and exposed him. Hence, whenever  Musaylimah is mentioned, he is described as `the Liar'. He became an example  for lying among the residents of the cities and villages and the residents of  the deserts, the bedouins.  Therefore, Allah first mentioned His Name - Allah - that is exclusively  His and described this Name by Ar-Rahman, which no one else is allowed  to use, just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáö ÇÏúÚõæÇú Çááøóåó Ãóæö ÇÏúÚõæÇú ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäó ÃóíøğÇ ãøóÇ ÊóÏúÚõæÇú İóáóåõ  ÇáÇøñÓúãóÂÁó ÇáúÍõÓúäóì</div><br>  (Say (O Muhammad ): "Invoke Allah or invoke Ar-Rahman (Allah),  by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best  Names.'') (17:110)  Only Musaylimah and those who followed his misguided ways described Musaylimah  by Ar-Rahman.  As for Allah's Name Ar-Rahim, Allah has described others by it.  For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßõãú ÑóÓõæáñ ãøöäú ÃóäİõÓößõãú ÚóÒöíÒñ Úóáóíúåö ãóÇ ÚóäöÊøõãú ÍóÑöíÕñ  Úóáóíúßõãú ÈöÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÑóÁõæİñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad ) from amongst yourselves  (i.e. whom you know well). It grieves him that you should receive any injury  or difficulty. He (Muhammad ) is anxious over you (to be rightly guided) for  the believers (he is) kind (full of pity), and Rahim (merciful)) (9:128).  Allah has also described some of His creation using some of His other Names.  For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ãöä äøõØúİóÉò ÃóãúÔóÇÌò äøóÈúÊóáöíåö İóÌóÚóáúäóÜåõ  ÓóãöíÚÇğ ÈóÕöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (Verily, We have created man from Nutfah (drops) of mixed semen (sexual discharge  of man and woman), in order to try him, so We made him hearer (Sami`) and  seer (Basir) (76:2).  In conclusion, there are several of Allah's Names that are used as names  for others besides Allah. Further, some of Allah's Names are exclusive  for Allah alone, such as Allah, Ar-Rahman, Al-Khaliq (the  Creator), Ar-Raziq (the Sustainer), and so forth.  Hence, Allah started the Tasmiyah (meaning, `In the Name of Allah,  Most Gracious Most Merciful') with His Name, Allah, and described Himself  as Ar-Rahman, (Most Gracious) which is softer and more general than Ar-Rahim.  The most honorable Names are mentioned first, just as Allah did here.  A Hadith narrated by Umm Salamah stated that the recitation of the Messenger  of Allah was slow and clear, letter by letter,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÓúãö Çááøóåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö - ÇáúÍóãúÏõ ááøóåö ÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó  - ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö - ãóÜáößö íóæúãö ÇáÏøöíäö </div><br>  (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. All the praises  and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists. The Most Gracious,  the Most Merciful. The Owner of the Day of Recompense) (1:1-4).  And this is how a group of scholars recite it. Others connected the recitation  of the Tasmiyah to Al-Hamd.  </div></body></html>
