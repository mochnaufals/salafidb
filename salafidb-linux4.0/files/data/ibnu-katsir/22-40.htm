Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others among the Salaf, such as Ibn `Abbas, `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, Zayd bin Aslam, Muqatil bin Hayan, Qatadah and others said, "This is the first Ayah which was revealed about Jihad.'' Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "When the Prophet was driven out of Makkah, Abu Bakr said, `They have their Prophet. Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return; surely they are doomed.''' Ibn `Abbas said, "Then Allah revealed the words:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõĞöäó áöáøóĞöíäó íõŞóÜÊóáõæäó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú ÙõáöãõæÇú æóÅöäøó Çááøóåó Úóáóì äóÕúÑöåöãú áóŞóÏöíÑñ </div><br>  (Permission (to fight) is given to those (believers) fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them victory.)''

"And this is what He did.'' Allah prescribed Jihad at an appropriate time, because when they were in Makkah, the idolators outnumbered them by more than ten to one. Were they to engage in fighting at that time, the results would have been disastrous. When the idolators went to extremes to persecute Muslims, to expel the Prophet and resolving to kill him; when they sent his Companions into exile here and there, so that some went to Ethiopia and others went to Al-Madinah; when they settled in Al-Madinah and the Messenger of Allah joined them there, and they gathered around him and lent him their support, and they had a place where Islam prevailed, and a stronghold to which they could retreat; then Allah prescribed Jihad against the enemy, and this was the first Ayah to be revealed for it. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõĞöäó áöáøóĞöíäó íõŞóÜÊóáõæäó ÈöÃóäøóåõãú ÙõáöãõæÇú æóÅöäøó Çááøóåó Úóáóì äóÕúÑöåöãú áóŞóÏöíÑñ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõÎúÑöÌõæÇú ãöä ÏöíóÜÑöåöã ÈöÛóíúÑö ÍóŞøò</div><br>  (Permission (to fight) is given to those fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them victory. Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said; "They were driven out of Makkah to Al-Madinah unjustly, i.e., Muhammad and his Companions.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Ãóä íóŞõæáõæÇú ÑóÈøõäóÇ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (only because they said: "Our Lord is Allah.'') means, they had not done anything to their people or committed any wrongs against them, apart from the fact that they believed in the Oneness of Allah and they worshipped Him Alone, with no partner or associate. But for the idolators, this was the worst of sins, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÎúÑöÌõæäó ÇáÑøóÓõæáó æóÅöíøóÜßõãú Ãóä ÊõÄúãöäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö ÑóÈøößõãú</div><br>  (and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves because you believe in Allah, your Lord!) 60:1.

This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak and others. Qatadah said, "This refers to the places of worship of the Sabians;'' according to another report, he said, "The Sawami` of the Zoroastrians.'' Muqatil bin Hayyan said, "These are houses along the roads.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈöíóÚñ</div><br>  (Biya`.) These are larger than the Sawami` and accommodate more worshippers; the Christians also have these. This was the view of Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ibn Sakhr, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Khusayf and others. Ibn Jubayr reported from Mujahid and others that this referred to the synagogues of the Jews which are known to them as Salut. And Allah knows best.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÕóáóæóÊö</div><br>  (Salawat) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "Salawat means churches.'' `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said that it referred to the synagogues of the Jews. Abu Al-`Aliyah and others said, "Salawat refers to the places of worship of the Sabians.'' Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said, "Salawat refers to places of worship of the People of the Book and of the people of Islam along the roads.'' Masjids belong to the Muslims.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõĞúßóÑõ İöíåóÇ ÇÓãõ Çááøóåö ßóËöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned much,) It was said that the pronoun refers to Masjids, because this is the closest of the words mentioned. Ad-Dahhak said, "In all of them the Name of Allah is often mentioned.'' Ibn Jarir said, "The correct view is that the monasteries of the monks, the churches of the Christians, the synagogues of the Jews and the Masjids of the Muslims, in which the Name of Allah is mentioned much, would have been destroyed -- because this is the usual usage in Arabic.'' Some of the scholars said, "This is a sequence listing the smallest to the greatest, because the Masjids are more frequented by more worshippers who have the correct intention and way.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóíóäÕõÑóäøó Çááøóåõ ãóä íóäÕõÑõåõ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah will help those who help His (cause).)
