Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó áöáúãõÊøóŞöíäó ãóİóÇÒÇğ </div><br>  (Verily, for those who have Taqwa, there will be a success;) Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak both said, "A place of enjoyable recreation.'' Mujahid and Qatadah both said, "They are successful and thus, they are saved from the Hellfire.'' The most obvious meaning here is the statement of Ibn `Abbas, because Allah says after this,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÏóÂÆöŞó</div><br>  (Hada'iq) And Hada'iq are gardens of palm trees and other things.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÏóÂÆöŞó æóÃóÚúäóÜÈÇğ - æóßóæóÇÚöÈó ÃóÊúÑóÇÈÇğ </div><br>  (And vineyards, and Kawa`ib Atrab,) meaning, wide-eyed maidens with fully developed breasts. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and others have said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóæÇÚöÈó</div><br>  (Kawa`ib) "This means round breasts. They meant by this that the breasts of these girls will be fully rounded and not sagging, because they will be virgins, equal in age. This means that they will only have one age.'' The explanation of this has already been mentioned in Surat Al-Waqi`ah. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÃúÓÇğ ÏöåóÇŞÇğ </div><br>  (And a cup Dihaq.) Ibn `Abbas said, "Continuously filled.'' `Ikrimah said, "Pure.'' Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, and Ibn Zayd all said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏöåóÇŞÇğ</div><br>  (Dihaq) "This means completely filled.'' Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóÓúãóÚõæäó İöíåóÇ áóÛúæÇğ æóáÇó ßöĞóÈÇğ </div><br>  (No Laghw shall they hear therein, nor lying;) This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó áóÛúæñ İöíåóÇ æóáÇó ÊóÃúËöíãñ</div><br>  (Free from any Laghw, and free from sin.) (52:23) meaning, there will not be any vain, worthless speech therein, nor any sinful lying. Rather, it will be the abode of peace, and everything that is in it will be free of any shortcomings. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌóÒóÂÁğ ãøöä ÑøóÈøößó ÚóØóÂÁğ ÍöÓóÇÈÇğ </div><br>  (Rewarded from your Lord with a sufficient gift.) meaning, `this that We have mentioned to you is what Allah will reward them with, and they will be given it by His favor and from Him. It will be a kindness, mercy, gift, and recompense from Him. It will be sufficient, suitable, comprehensive and abundant.' The Arabs say, "He gave me and he sufficed me.'' This means that he sufficiently provided for me.'' From this comes the saying, "Allah is sufficient for me.''  </div></body></html>
