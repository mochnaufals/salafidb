Further, what they were granted in this life of wealth and offspring shall not avail them with Allah, or save them from His punishment and severe torment. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊõÚúÌöÈúßó Ãóãúæóáõåõãú æóáÇó ÃóæúáóÜÏõåõãú ÅöäøóãóÇ íõÑöíÏõ Çááøóåõ áöíõÚóĞøöÈóåõãú ÈöåóÇ İöí ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÊóÒúåóŞó ÃóäİõÓõåõãú æóåõãú ßóÜİöÑõæäó </div><br>  (So let not their wealth nor their children amaze you; in reality Allah's plan is to punish them with these things in the life of this world, and that their souls shall depart (die) while they are disbelievers.) 9:55, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÛõÑøóäøóßó ÊóŞóáøõÈõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú İöì ÇáúÈöáóÜÏö - ãóÊóÜÚñ Şóáöíáñ Ëõãøó ãóÃúæóÇåõãú Ìóåóäøóãõ æóÈöÆúÓó ÇáúãöåóÇÏõ </div><br>  (Let not the free disposal (and affluence) of the disbelievers throughout the land deceive you. A brief enjoyment; then, their ultimate abode is Hell; and worst indeed is that place for rest.) 3:196, 197.  Allah said in this Ayah 3:10,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieve) meaning, disbelieved in Allah's Ayat, denied His Messengers, defied His Books and did not benefit from His revelation to His Prophets,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä ÊõÛúäöìó Úóäúåõãú Ãóãúæóáõåõãú æóáÇó ÃóæúáÜÏõåõã ãøöäó Çááøóåö ÔóíúÆğÇ æóÃõæáóÜÆößó åõãú æóŞõæÏõ ÇáäøóÇÑö</div><br>  (Neither their properties nor their offspring will avail them whatsoever against Allah; and it is they who will be fuel of the Fire.) meaning, they will be the wood with which the Fire is kindled and fed. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßõãú æóãóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ÍóÕóÈõ Ìóåóäøóãó</div><br>  (Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell!) 21:98.  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÏóÃúÈö ÁóÇáö İöÑúÚóæúäó</div><br>  (Like the Da'b of the people of Fira`wn.) Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah means, "Like the behavior of the people of Fir`awn.'' This is the same Tafsir of `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak, and others. Other scholars said that the Ayah means, "Like the practice, conduct, likeness of the people of Fir`awn.'' These meanings are all plausible, for the Da'b means practice, behavior, tradition and habit. The Ayah indicates that the disbelievers will not benefit from their wealth or offspring. Rather, they will perish and be punished. This is the same end the people of Fir`awn and the previous nations met, those who rejected the Messengers, the Ayat, and proofs of Allah that they were sent with.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÔóÏöíÏõ ÇáúÚöŞóÇÈö</div><br>  (And Allah is severe in punishment.) meaning, His punishment is severe and His torment is painful. None can escape Allah's grasp, nor does anything escape His knowledge. Allah does what He wills and prevails over all things, it is He to Whom everything is humbled and there is no deity worthy of worship, nor any Lord except Him.  </div></body></html>
