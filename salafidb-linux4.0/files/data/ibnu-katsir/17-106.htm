It has come to you with the truth, brought down by one mighty in power, trustworthy and strong, one who is obeyed by the higher group (angels).'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇßó</div><br>  (And We have sent you) O Muhammad   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãõÈóÔøöÑğÇ æóäóĞöíÑğÇ</div><br>  (as nothing but a bearer of glad tidings and a warner). a bearer of glad tidings for the believers who obey you and a warner to the disbelievers who disobey you.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõÑúÁÇäğÇ İóÑóŞúäóÇåõ</div><br>  (And (it is) a Qur'an which We have divided), The word translated here as "We have divided'' may be read in two ways. If it is read as "Faraqnahu'', with no Shaddah, the meaning is: `We have made it depart from Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz to Bayt Al-`Izzah in the lowest heaven, then it was revealed in stages to the Messenger of Allah, according to events, over a period of twenty-three years.' This was narrated by `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas. It was also narrated that Ibn `Abbas read it as "Farraqnahu'', with a Shaddah, meaning, `We revealed it Ayah by Ayah , and have explained it and made it clear.' Hence Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöÊóŞúÑóÃóåõ Úóáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (in order that you might recite it to men), meaning, convey it to the people and recite it to them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóì ãõßúËò</div><br>  (at intervals.) meaning slowly.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÒøóáúäóÜåõ ÊóäúÒöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And We have revealed it by stages.) means, little by little.  </div></body></html>
