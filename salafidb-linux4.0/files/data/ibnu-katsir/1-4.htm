The Owner of the Day of Recompense.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Indicating Sovereignty on the Day of Judgment</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah mentioned His sovereignty of the Day of Resurrection, but this does not negate His sovereignty over all other things. For Allah mentioned that He is the Lord of existence, including this earthly life and the Hereafter. Allah only mentioned the Day of Recompense here because on that Day, no one except Him will be able to claim ownership of anything whatsoever. On that Day, no one will be allowed to speak without His permission. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóŞõæãõ ÇáÑøõæÍõ æóÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ ÕóİøÇğ áÇøó íóÊóßóáøóãõæäó ÅöáÇøó ãóäú ÃóĞöäó áóåõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ æóŞóÇáó ÕóæóÇÈÇğ </div><br>  (The Day that Ar-Ruh (Jibril (Gabriel) or another angel) and the angels will stand forth in rows, they will not speak except him whom the Most Gracious (Allah) allows, and he will speak what is right.) (78:38),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÎóÔóÚóÊö ÇáÃóÕúæóÇÊõ áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö İóáÇó ÊóÓúãóÚõ ÅöáÇøó åóãúÓÇğ</div><br>  (And all voices will be humbled for the Most Gracious (Allah), and nothing shall you hear but the low voice of their footsteps.)(20:108), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÃúÊö áÇó Êóßóáøóãõ äóİúÓñ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÅöĞúäöåö İóãöäúåõãú ÔóŞöìøñ æóÓóÚöíÏñ </div><br>  (On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His (Allah's) leave. Some among them will be wretched and (others) blessed) (11:105).  Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas commented, "Allah says, `On that Day, no one owns anything that they used to own in the world.''' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of Yawm Ad-Din</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ibn `Abbas said, "Yawm Ad-Din is the Day of Recompense for the creatures, meaning the Day of Judgment. On that Day, Allah will reckon the creation for their deeds, evil for evil, good for good, except for those whom He pardons.'' In addition, several other Companions, Tabi`in and scholars of the Salaf, said similarly, for this meaning is apparent and clear from the Ayah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah is Al-Malik (King or Owner)</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah is the True Owner (Malik) (of everything and everyone). Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó Çáúãóáößõ ÇáúŞõÏøõæÓõ ÇáÓøóáóÜãõ</div><br>  (He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the King, the Holy, the One free from all defects) (59:23).  Also, the Two Sahihs recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÎúäóÚõ ÇÓúãò ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ÑóÌõáñ ÊóÓóãøóì Èöãóáößö ÇáúÃóãúáóÇßö æóáóÇ ãóÇáößó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ»</div><br>  (The most despicable name to Allah is a person who calls himself the king of kings, while there are no owners except Allah.)  Also the Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞúÈöÖõ Çááåõ ÇáúÃóÑúÖó æóíóØúæöí ÇáÓøóãóÇÁó Èöíóãöíäöåö Ëõãøó íóŞõæáõ: ÃóäóÇ Çáúãóáößõ¡ Ãóíúäó ãõáõæßõ ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¿ Ãóíúäó ÇáúÌóÈøóÇÑõæäó¿ Ãóíúäó ÇáúãõÊóßóÈøöÑõæäó¿»</div><br>  ((On the Day of Judgement) Allah will grasp the earth and fold up the heavens with His Right Hand and proclaim, 'I Am the King!

As for calling someone other than Allah a king in this life, 3-24). :23NNA  r-Rahman (the Most Gracious), Ar-Rahim (the Most Merciful)) We explained these Names in the Basmalah. Al-Qurtubi said, "Allah has described Himself by `Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim' after saying `the Lord of the Alamin', so His statement here includes a warning, and then an encouragement. Similarly, Allah said, ÍRNA ? Allah is Al-Malik (King or Owner)  Allah is the True Owner (Malik) (of everything and everyone). Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó Çáúãóáößõ ÇáúŞõÏøõæÓõ ÇáÓøóáóÜãõ</div><br>  (He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the King, the Holy, the One free from all defects) (59:23).  Also, the Two Sahihs recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÎúäóÚõ ÇÓúãò ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ÑóÌõáñ ÊóÓóãøóì Èöãóáößö ÇáúÃóãúáóÇßö æóáóÇ ãóÇáößó ÅöáøóÇ Çááåõ»</div><br>  (The most despicable name to Allah is a person who calls himself the king of kings, while there are no owners except Allah.)

As for calling someone other than Allah a king in this life, then it is done as a figure of speech. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ŞóÏú ÈóÚóËó áóßõãú ØóÇáõæÊó ãóáößğÇ</div><br>  (Indeed Allah appointed Talut (Saul) as a king over you.)

Also, the Two Sahihs recorded,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãöËúáõ Çáúãõáõæßö Úóáóì ÇáúÃóÓöÑøóÉö»</div><br>  (Just like kings reclining on their thrones) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of Ad-Din</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ad-Din means the reckoning, the reward or punishment. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãóÆöĞò íõæóİøöíåöãõ Çááøóåõ Ïöíäóåõãõ ÇáúÍóŞøó</div><br>  (On that Day Allah will pay them the (Dinahum) recompense (of their deeds) in full) (24:25), and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁöäøóÇ áóãóÏöíäõæäó</div><br>  (Shall we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punishment (according to our deeds)) (37:53).

Also, `Umar said, "Hold yourself accountable before you are held accountable, weigh yourselves before you are weighed, and be prepared for the biggest gathering before He Whose knowledge encompasses your deeds,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãóÆöĞò ÊõÚúÑóÖõæäó áÇó ÊóÎúİóì ãöäßõãú ÎóÇİöíóÉñ </div><br>  (That Day shall you be brought to Judgement, not a secret of yours will be hidden) (69:18).''  </div></body></html>
