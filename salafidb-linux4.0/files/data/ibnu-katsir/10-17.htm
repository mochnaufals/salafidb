So who does more wrong than he who forges a lie against Allah or denies His Ayat Surely, the criminals will never be successful!)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah says that no one is more wrong, unjust and arrogant than he who invented a lie against Allah, forged claims about Allah, or claimed that Allah has sent a message to him but his claim was not true.</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  No one is more of a criminal or has committed greater wrong than such a person. Liars cannot be confused with Prophets. Anyone who claims such a thing, whether lying or telling the truth, will necessarily be supported by Allah with proofs and signs of his falsehood or truthfulness. The difference between Muhammad and Musaylamah the liar, was clearer to those who met both of them than the difference between forenoon and midnight when it is extremely dark. Those who are clear-sighted can distinguish via signs and proofs between the truthfulness of Muhammad and the falsehood of Musaylamah the liar, Sajah and Al-Aswad Al-`Ansi. Abdullah bin Salam said: "When Allah's Messenger arrived at Al-Madinah, people were scared away and I was one of them. But when I saw him, I realized that his face could never be the face of a liar. The first thing I heard from him was his statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÃóİúÔõæÇ ÇáÓøóáóÇãó¡ æóÃóØúÚöãõæÇ ÇáØøóÚóÇãó¡ æóÕöáõæÇ ÇáúÃóÑúÍóÇãó¡ æóÕóáøõæÇ ÈöÇááøóíúáö æóÇáäøóÇÓõ äöíóÇãõ¡ÊóÏúÎõáõæÇ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ÈöÓóáóÇã»</div><br>  (O people, spread the greetings of peace, feed others, be dutiful to your relatives and offer prayers in the night when others are asleep so that you will enter Paradise in peace.)'' When Dimam bin Tha`labah came to Allah's Messenger and asked him in the presence of his people -- Banu Sa`d bin Bakr: "Who raised this heaven'' He replied, Ç. (Allah). He asked: "And who erected these mountains'' He replied, Ç. (Allah). He asked: "Who spread out this earth'' He replied, Ç. (Allah). Then he asked: "I ask you in the name of the One, Who raised the heavens, erected the mountains, and spread out this earth, has Allah sent you as a Messenger to all mankind'' He said, i   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çóááøóåõãøó äóÚóã»</div><br>  (By Allah, Yes!) Then Dimam asked him about Salah, Zakah, Hajj and fasting. With every question he swore by Allah and with every response the Prophet swore also. Dimam then said: "You indeed are telling the truth. By the One Who sent you with the truth I will not increase or decrease from what you have told me.'' This man was content with the few responses of the Prophet . He was convinced of the Prophet's truthfulness by the signs that he saw and witnessed. It was narrated that `Amr bin Al-`As went to Musaylamah. `Amr was not a Muslim at that time and he was a friend of Musaylamah. Musaylamah said: "Woe unto you `Amr. What was revealed unto your friend -- meaning Allah's Messenger -- during this period'' `Amr replied: "I heard his companions reading a short but great Surah.'' He asked, "And what was that'' He recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÚóÕúÑö - Åöäøó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó áóİöì ÎõÓúÑò </div><br>  (By Al-`Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss.) 103:1-2 until the end of the Surah. Musaylamah thought for a while and then said: "Something similar to that was also revealed to me.'' `Amr asked: "And what is it'' He then recited: "O Wabr, O Wabr! You are only two ears and a breast. The rest of you is hollow.' What do you think, `Amr'' `Amr then said: "By Allah, you know that I know that you are a liar.'' This was a statement made by an idolator in judgment of Musaylamah. He knew Muhammad and his truthfulness. He also knew Musaylamah and his tendency toward falsehood and lying. People who think and have insight know even better. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäú ÃóÙúáóãõ ãöãøóäö ÇİúÊóÑóì Úóáóì Çááøóåö ßóĞöÈÇğ Ãóæú ŞóÇáó ÃõæúÍöì Åöáóìøó æóáóãú íõæÍó Åöáóíúåö ÔóìúÁñ æóãóä ŞóÇáó ÓóÃõäÒöáõ ãöËúáó ãóÂ ÃóäóÒáó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (And who does more aggression and wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Ayat.) 6:21   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóäú ÃóÙúáóãõ ãöãøóäö ÇİúÊóÑóì Úóáóì Çááøóåö ßóĞöÈğÇ Ãóæú ßóĞøóÈó ÈöÂíóÜÊöåö Åöäøóåõ áÇó íõİúáöÍõ ÇáúãõÌúÑöãõæäó </div><br>  (So who does more wrong than he who forges a lie against Allah or denies His Ayat Surely, the criminals will never be successful!) 10:17 No one is more unjust than he who belies the truth which the Messengers have brought supported with evidence and proof.  </div></body></html>
