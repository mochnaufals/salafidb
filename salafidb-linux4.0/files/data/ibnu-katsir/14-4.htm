This is from Allah's wisdom with His creation, every Prophet He sent to a people spoke their language and everyone of these Prophets were only sent to their people. Muhammad bin `Abdullah, Allah's Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, was sent to all people. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Jabir said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃõÚúØöíÊõ ÎóãúÓğÇ áóãú íõÚúØóåõäøó ÃóÍóÏñ ãöäó ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁö ŞóÈúáöí:äõÕöÑúÊõ ÈöÇáÑøõÚúÈö ãóÓöíÑóÉó ÔóåúÑò¡ æóÌõÚöáóÊö áöíó ÇáúÃóÑúÖõ ãóÓúÌöÏğÇ æóØóåõæÑğÇ¡ æóÃõÍöáøóÊú áöíó ÇáúÛóäóÇÆöãõ æóáóãú ÊõÍóáøó áöÃóÍóÏò ŞóÈúáöí¡ æóÃõÚúØöíÊõ ÇáÔøóİóÇÚóÉó¡ æóßóÇäó ÇáäøóÈöíøõ íõÈúÚóËõ Åöáóì Şóæúãöåö ÎóÇÕøóÉğ æóÈõÚöËúÊõ Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö ÚóÇãøóÉ»</div><br>  (I have been given five things which were not given to anyone else before me.
