And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Qur'an and the Disbelievers turning away;</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  They could be compelled to believe if Allah so willed At the beginning of the explanation of Surat Al-Baqarah we discussed the letters which appear at the beginning of some Surahs. Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÁÇíóÇÊõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö ÇáúãõÈöíäö</div><br>  (These are the Ayat of the Book Mubin.) means, these are the verses of the Clear Qur'an, i.e. the clear and unambiguous Book which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, misguidance and guidance.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóßó ÈóÜÎöÚñ äøóİúÓóßó</div><br>  (It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, destroy yourself -- because of your keenness that they should be guided and your grief for them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇøó íóßõæäõæÇú ãõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  (that they do not become believers.) Here Allah is consoling His Messenger for the lack of faith of those among the disbelievers who do not believe in him. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóĞúåóÈú äóİúÓõßó Úóáóíúåöãú ÍóÓóÑóÊò</div><br>  (So destroy not yourself in sorrow for them) (35:8).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóÚóáøóßó ÈóÜÎöÚñ äøóİúÓóßó Úóáóì ÁóÇËóÜÑöåöãú Åöä áøóãú íõÄúãöäõæÇú ÈöåóÜĞóÇ ÇáúÍóÏöíËö ÃóÓóİÇğ </div><br>  (Perhaps, you would Bakhi` yourself, over their footsteps, because they believe not in this narration) (18:6). Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, `Atiyyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan and others said that:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóßó ÈóÜÎöÚñ äøóİúÓóßó</div><br>  (It may be that you are going Bakhi` yourself,) means, `kill yourself.' Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä äøóÔóÃú äõäóÒøöáú Úóáóíúåöãú ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ÁóÇíóÉğ İóÙóáøóÊú ÃóÚúäóÜŞõåõãú áóåóÇ ÎóÜÖöÚöíäó </div><br>  (If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.) meaning, `if We so willed, We could send down a sign that would force them to believe, but We will not do that because We do not want anyone to believe except by choice.' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó ÑóÈøõßó áÂãóäó ãóä İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ßõáøõåõãú ÌóãöíÚğÇ ÃóİóÃóäÊó ÊõßúÑöåõ ÇáäøóÇÓó ÍóÊøóì íóßõæäõæÇú ãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you then compel mankind, until they become believers.) (10:99)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÔóÂÁó ÑóÈøõßó áóÌóÚóáó ÇáäøóÇÓó ÃõãøóÉğ æóÇÍöÏóÉğ</div><br>  (And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely, have made mankind one Ummah...) (11:118) But Allah's will has acted, His decree has come to pass, and His proof has been conveyed to mankind by mission of Messengers and the revelation of Books to them. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÃúÊöíåöã ãøöä ĞößúÑò ãøöäó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ãõÍúÏóËò ÅöáÇøó ßóÇäõæÇú Úóäúåõ ãõÚúÑöÖöíäó </div><br>  (And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.) meaning, every time a Scripture comes from heaven to them, most of the people turn away from it. As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóßúËóÑõ ÇáäøóÇÓö æóáóæú ÍóÑóÕúÊó ÈöãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) (12:103)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÍóÓúÑóÉğ Úóáóì ÇáúÚöÈóÇÏö ãóÇ íóÃúÊöíåöãú ãøöä ÑøóÓõæáò ÅöáÇøó ßóÇäõæÇú Èöåö íóÓúÊóåúÒöÁõæäó </div><br>  (Alas for mankind! There never came a Messenger to them but they used to mock at him.) (36:30)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ÑõÓõáóäóÇ ÊóÊúÑóì ßõáøó ãóÇ ÌóÂÁó ÃõãøóÉğ ÑøóÓõæáõåóÇ ßóĞøóÈõæåõ</div><br>  (Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their Messenger, they denied him...) (23:44). Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóÏú ßóĞøóÈõæÇú İóÓóíóÃúÊöíåöãú ÃóäÈóÜÄõÇ ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú Èöåö íóÓúÊóåúÒöÁõæäó </div><br>  (So, they have indeed denied, then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.) meaning, they denied the truth that came to them, so they will come to know the news of the consequences of this denial after a while.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóíóÚúáóãú ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú Ãóìøó ãõäŞóáóÈò íóäŞóáöÈõæäó</div><br>  (And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned) (26:227). Then Allah tells those who dared to oppose His Messenger and disbelieve in His Book, that He is the Subduer, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, Who created the earth and caused every good kind of crop, fruit and animal to grow therein. Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated from a man from Ash-Sha`bi that people are a product of the earth. So whoever enters Paradise is good and noble, and whoever enters Hell is base and vile.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áÂíóÉğ</div><br>  (Verily, in this is an Ayah,) meaning an evidence of the power of the Creator of all things. He spread out the earth and raised the canopy of the heavens, yet despite that the majority of people do not believe, rather they deny Him, His Messengers, and His Books, and they go against His commands doing the things He had prohibited. His saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ÑóÈøóßó áóåõæó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ</div><br>  (And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty,) means, the One Who has power over all things, to subdue and control them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÑøóÍöíãö</div><br>  (the Most Merciful. ) means, towards His creation, for He does not hasten to punish the one who sins, but He gives him time to repent, and if he does not, then He seizes him with a mighty punishment. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Ibn Ishaq said: "He is Almighty in His punishment of those who went against His commands and worshipped others besides Him.'' Sa`id bin Jubayr said: "He is Most Merciful towards those who repent to Him and turn to Him.''  </div></body></html>
