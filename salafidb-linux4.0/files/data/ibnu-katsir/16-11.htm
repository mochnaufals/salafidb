Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóßõã ãøóäúåõ ÔóÑóÇÈñ</div><br>  (from it you drink) meaning, He made it fresh and pure so that they can drink it, not salty and undrinkable.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäúåõ ÔóÌóÑñ İöíåö ÊõÓöíãõæäó</div><br>  (and from it (grows) the vegetation on which you send your cattle to pasture.) meaning, from it He raised plants on which your cattle graze. Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd, all said that this refers to grazing animals including camels.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõäÈöÊõ áóßõãú Èöåö ÇáÒøóÑúÚó æóÇáÒøóíúÊõæäó æóÇáäøóÎöíáó æóÇáÃóÚúäóÜÈó æóãöä ßõáøö ÇáËøóãóÑóÊö</div><br>  (With it He causes crops to grow for you, olives, date palms, grapes, and every kind of fruit.) meaning, with this one kind of water, He makes the earth sprout plants with different tastes, colors, scents and shapes. For this reason He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áÂíóÉğ áøöŞóæúãò íóÊóİóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (Verily, in this there is indeed an evident proof and a manifest sign for people who give thought.) meaning, this is a sign and a proof that there is no god besides Allah, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãøóäú ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó æóÃóäÒóáó áóßõãú ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ãóÂÁğ İóÃóäÈóÊúäóÇ Èöåö ÍóÏóÂÆöŞó ĞóÇÊó ÈóåúÌóÉò ãøóÇ ßóÇäó áóßõãú Ãóä ÊõäÈöÊõæÇú ÔóÌóÑóåóÇ ÃóÅöáóÜåñ ãøóÚó Çááøóåö Èóáú åõãú Şóæúãñ íóÚúÏöáõæäó </div><br>  (Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends water down for you from the sky, from which We cause wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight to grow You are not able to cause the growth of their trees.
