And here He tells us about those who call others to misguidance, the leaders of disbelief and innovation:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íõÌóÜÏöáõ İöì Çááøóåö ÈöÛóíúÑö Úöáúãò æóáÇó åõÏğì æóáÇó ßöÊóÜÈò ãøõäöíÑò </div><br>  (And among men is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light (from Allah).) meaning, with no correct rational thought, and no clear transmitted text; what they say is based only on their opinions and whims. Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ËóÇäöìó ÚöØúİöåö</div><br>  (Bending his neck in pride,) Ibn `Abbas and others said, "Too proud to follow the truth when he is called to it.'' Mujahid, Qatadah and Malik said, narrating from Zayd bin Aslam:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ËóÇäöìó ÚöØúİöåö</div><br>  (Bending his neck in pride,) means, twisting his neck, i.e., turning away from the truth to which he is called, bending his neck out of pride and arrogance. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİöì ãõæÓóì ÅöĞú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÜåõ Åöáóì İöÑúÚóæúäó ÈöÓõáúØóÜäò ãøõÈöíäò İóÊóæóáøóì ÈöÑõßúäöåö</div><br>  (And in Musa, when We sent him to Fir`awn with a manifest authority. But (Fir`awn) turned away along with his hosts) 51:38-39,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ Şöíáó áóåõãú ÊóÚóÇáóæúÇú Åöáóì ãóÂ ÃóäÒóáó Çááøóåõ æóÅöáóì ÇáÑøóÓõæáö ÑóÃóíúÊó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó íóÕõÏøõæäó Úóäßó ÕõÏõæÏÇğ </div><br>  (And when it is said to them: "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger,'' you see the hypocrites turn away from you with aversion.) 4:61,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ Şöíáó áóåõãú ÊóÚóÇáóæúÇú íóÓúÊóÛúİöÑú áóßõãú ÑóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö áóæøóæúÇú ÑõÁõæÓóåõãú æóÑóÃóíúÊóåõãú íóÕõÏøõæäó æóåõã ãøõÓúÊóßúÈöÑõæäó </div><br>  (And when it is said to them: "Come, so that the Messenger of Allah may ask forgiveness from Allah for you,'' they twist their heads, and you would see them turning away their faces in pride.) 63:5, And Luqman said to his son:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊõÕóÚøöÑú ÎóÏøóßó áöáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (And turn not your face away from men with pride) 31:18 meaning, do not turn away from them in an arrogant manner. And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÊõÊúáóì Úóáóíúåö ÁóÇíóÜÊõäóÇ æóáøóì ãõÓúÊóßúÈöÑÇğ</div><br>  (And when Our verses are recited to him, he turns away in pride) 31:7.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíõÖöáøó Úóä ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (and leading (others) too (far) astray from the path of Allah.) This either refers to those who are stubborn, or it means that the person who does this has been created like this so that he will be one of those who lead others astray from the path of Allah. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõ İöì ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÎöÒúìñ</div><br>  (For him there is disgrace in this worldly life,) meaning, humiliation and shame, such as when he is too arrogant to heed the signs of Allah, so Allah will send humiliation upon him in this world and will punish him in this world, before he reaches the Hereafter, because this world is all he cares about and all he knows.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõĞöíŞõåõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö ÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáúÍóÑöíŞöĞáößó ÈöãóÇ ŞóÏøóãóÊú íóÏóÇßó</div><br>  (and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste the torment of burning. That is because of what your hands have sent forth,) means, this will be said to him by way of rebuke.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó Çááøóåó áóíúÓó ÈöÙóáøóÜãò áøöáúÚóÈöíÏö</div><br>  (and verily, Allah is not unjust to the servants.) This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎõĞõæåõ İóÇÚúÊöáõæåõ Åöáóì ÓóæóÂÁö ÇáúÌóÍöíãö - Ëõãøó ÕõÈøõæÇú İóæúŞó ÑóÃúÓöåö ãöäú ÚóĞóÇÈö ÇáúÍóãöíãö - ĞõŞú Åöäøóßó ÃóäÊó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúßóÑöíãõ - Åöäøó åóÜĞóÇ ãóÇ ßõäÊõãú Èöåö ÊóãúÊóÑõæäó </div><br>  ((It will be said: ) "Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, Then pour over his head the torment of boiling water. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous! Verily, this is that whereof you used to doubt!'') 44:47-50  </div></body></html>
