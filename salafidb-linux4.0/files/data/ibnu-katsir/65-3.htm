Otherwise, he must decide to divorce her on good terms, without abusing, cursing, or admonishing her. To the contrary, he should divorce her on good terms, observing kindness and good manners. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to have Witnesses for the Return</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÔúåöÏõæÇú Ğóæóì ÚóÏúáò ãøöäßõãú</div><br>  (And take as witness two just persons from among you.) meaning when taking her back, if this is your decision. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that `Imran bin Husayn was asked about a man who divorced his wife and then had sexual intercourse with her, without notifying witnesses of when he divorced her and when he took her back. `Imran said, "His divorce and taking her back was in contradiction to the Sunnah. Incorporate the presence of witnesses for divorcing her and taking her back, and do not repeat your conduct.'' Ibn Jurayj said that `Ata' commented on the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÔúåöÏõæÇú Ğóæóì ÚóÏúáò ãøöäßõãú</div><br>  (And take as witness two just persons from among you.) "It is not permissible to marry, divorce or take back the divorced wife except with two just witnesses, just as Allah the Exalted has said, except when there is a valid excuse.''

This legislation is meant to benefit those who fear Allah's punishment in the Hereafter. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah provides, suffices, and makes a Way out of Every Hardship for Those Who have Taqwa</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÊøóŞö Çááøóåó íóÌúÚóá áøóåõ ãóÎúÑóÌÇğæóíóÑúÒõŞúåõ ãöäú ÍóíúËõ áÇó íóÍúÊóÓöÈõ</div><br>  (And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.

Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur'an is,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóÃúãõÑõ ÈöÇáúÚóÏúáö æóÇáÅúÍúÓóÇäö</div><br>  (Verily, Allah enjoins Al-`Adl (justice) and Al-Ihsan (doing good) (16:90).
