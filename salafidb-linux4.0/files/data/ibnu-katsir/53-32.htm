They sometimes commit minor sins, but they will be forgiven these minor sins and covered from exposure, as Allah mentioned in another Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊóÌúÊóäöÈõæÇú ßóÈóÂÆöÑó ãóÇ Êõäåóæúäó Úóäúåõ äõßóİøöÑú Úóäúßõãú ÓóíøöÆóÜÊößõãú æóäõÏúÎöáúßõãú ãøõÏúÎóáÇğ ßóÑöíãÇğ </div><br>  (If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance.)(4:31) Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÌúÊóäöÈõæäó ßóÈóÜÆöÑó ÇáÅöËúãö æóÇáúİóæóÍöÔó ÅöáÇøó Çááøóãóãó</div><br>  (Those who avoid great sins and Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) except Al-Lamam), Al-Lamam means, small faults and minor errors. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "I have not seen anything that resembles Al-Lamam better than the Hadith that Abu Hurayrah narrated from the Prophet ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì ßóÊóÈó Úóáóì ÇÈúäö ÂÏóãó ÍóÙøóåõ ãöäó ÇáÒøöäóÇ¡ ÃóÏúÑóßó Ğáößó áóÇ ãóÍóÇáóÉó¡ İóÒöäóÇ ÇáúÚóíúäö ÇáäøóÙóÑõ¡ æóÒöäóÇ ÇááøöÓóÇäö ÇáäøõØúŞõ¡ æóÇáäøóİúÓõ ÊóÊóãóäøóì æóÊóÔúÊóåöí¡ æóÇáúİóÑúÌõ íõÕöÏøöŞõ Ğáößó Ãóæú íõßóĞøöÈõå»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah the Exalted has decreed for the Son of Adam his share of Zina and he will certainly earn his share. The Zina of the eye is by looking, the Zina of the tongue is by talking and the heart wishes and lusts, but the sexual organ either substantiates all this or not.)'' This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, "The eyes commit Zina by looking, the lips by kissing, the hands by transgressing, the feet by walking, and the sexual organ either materializes all of this or not. When one commits sexual intercourse, he will be someone who committed Zina. Otherwise, it is Al-Lamam.'' Masruq and Ash-Sha`bi also held the same view. `Abdur-Rahman bin Nafi`, who is also known as Ibn Lubabah At-Ta'ifi, said, "I asked Abu Hurayrah about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó Çááøóãóãó</div><br>  (except the Lamam), and he said, `It pertains to kissing, winking one's eye, looking and embracing. When the sexual organ meets the sexual organ in intercourse then Ghusl is obligatory, and that is Zina.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Encouraging Repentance and forbidding Claims of Purity for Oneself</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó æóÓöÚõ ÇáúãóÛúİöÑóÉö</div><br>  (verily, your Lord is of vast forgiveness.) asserts that His Mercy encompasses everything, and His forgiveness entails every type of sin, if one repents,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íÚöÈóÇÏöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÓúÑóİõæÇú Úóáóì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú áÇó ÊóŞúäóØõæÇú ãöä ÑøóÍúãóÉö Çááøóåö Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóÛúİöÑõ ÇáĞøõäõæÈó ÌóãöíÚÇğ Åöäøóåõ åõæó ÇáúÛóİõæÑõ ÇáÑøóÍöíãõ </div><br>  (Say: "O My servants who have transgressed against them- selves!

Nay, but Allah sanctifies whom He wills, and they will not be dealt with unjustly, even equal to the extent of a Fatil.) (4:49) In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Muhammad bin `Amr bin `Ata said, "I called my daughter, Barrah (the pious one), and Zaynab bint Abu Salamah said to me, `The Messenger of Allah forbade using this name. I was originally called Barrah and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊõÒóßøõæÇ ÃóäúİõÓóßõãú¡ Åöäøó Çááåó ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöÃóåúáö ÇáúÈöÑøö ãöäúßõã»</div><br>  (Do not ascribe purity to yourselves; Allah knows best who the pious people among you are)' They said, `What should we call her' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓóãøõæåóÇ ÒóíúäóÈ»</div><br>  (Call her Zaynab.)'' Imam Ahmad recorded a Hadith from `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakrah, from his father who said, "A man praised another man before the Prophet .

Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Hammam bin Al-Harith said, "A man came before `Uthman bin `Affan and praised him. Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad started throwing sand in the face of that man, saying, `The Messenger of Allah ordered us to throw sand in their faces when we see those who praise.''' Muslim and Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith.  </div></body></html>
