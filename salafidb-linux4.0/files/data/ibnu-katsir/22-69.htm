Ibn Jarir said, "This means that there are Mansak for every Prophet's nation.'' He said, "The origin of the word Mansik in Arabic means the place to which a person returns repeatedly, for good or evil purposes. So the Manasik (rites) of Hajj are so called because the people return to them and adhere to them.'' If the phrase "For every nation We have ordained religious ceremonies'' means that every Prophet's nation has its religious ceremonies as ordained by Allah, then the phrase "So let them (the pagans) not dispute with you on the matter'' refers to the idolators. If the phrase "For every nation We have ordained religious ceremonies'' means that it is the matter of Qadar (divine decree), as in the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáößõáøò æöÌúåóÉñ åõæó ãõæóáøöíåóÇ</div><br>  (For each nation there is a direction to which they face)2:148 Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõãú äóÇÓößõæåõ</div><br>  (which they Nasikuh) meaning, which they must act upon. The pronoun here refers back to those who have these religious ceremonies and ways, i.e., they do this by the will and decree of Allah, so do not let their dispute with you over that divert you from following the truth. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÏúÚõ Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó Åöäøóßó áóÚóáóì åõÏğì ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò</div><br>  (but invite them to your Lord.
