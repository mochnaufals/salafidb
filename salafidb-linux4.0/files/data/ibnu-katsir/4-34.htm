Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are Qanitat, and guard in the husband's absence what Allah orders them to guard. As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct, admonish them, and abandon them in their beds, and beat them, but if they return to obedience, do not seek a means against them. Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.)  Allah said,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÑøöÌóÇáõ ŞóæøóÇãõæäó Úóáóì ÇáäøöÓóÂÁö</div><br>  (Men are the protectors and maintainers of women,) meaning, the man is responsible for the woman, and he is her maintainer, caretaker and leader who disciplines her if she deviates.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöãóÇ İóÖøóáó Çááøóåõ ÈóÚúÖóåõãú Úóáóì ÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (because Allah has made one of them to excel the other,) meaning, because men excel over women and are better than them for certain tasks. This is why prophethood was exclusive of men, as well as other important positions of leadership. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóäú íõİúáöÍó Şóæúãñ æóáøóæúÇ ÃóãúÑóåõãõ ÇãúÑóÃóÉ»</div><br>  (People who appoint a woman to be their leader, will never achieve success.)  Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith. Such is the case with appointing women as judges or on other positions of leadership.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈöãóÂ ÃóäİóŞõæÇú ãöäú Ãóãúæóáöåöãú</div><br>  (and because they spend from their means.) meaning the dowry, expenditures and various expenses that Allah ordained in His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger for men to spend on women. For these reasons it is suitable that he is appointed her maintainer, just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöáÑøöÌóÇáö Úóáóíúåöäøó ÏóÑóÌóÉñ</div><br>  (But men have a degree (of responsibility) over them). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Qualities of the Righteous Wife</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊõ</div><br>  (Therefore, the righteous) women,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÜäöÊóÜÊò</div><br>  (are Qanitat), obedient to their husbands, as Ibn `Abbas and others stated.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÜİöÙóÜÊñ áøöáúÛóíúÈö</div><br>  (and guard in the husband's absence) As-Suddi and others said that it means she protects her honor and her husband's property when he is absent, and Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöãóÇ ÍóİöÙó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (what Allah orders them to guard.) means, the protected husband is the one whom Allah protects. Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÎóíúÑõ ÇáäøöÓóÇÁö ÇãúÑóÃóÉñ ÅöĞóÇ äóÙóÑúÊó ÅöáóíúåóÇ ÓóÑøóÊúßó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÃóãóÑúÊóåóÇ ÃóØóÇÚóÊúßó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÛöÈúÊó ÚóäúåóÇ ÍóİöÙóÊúßó İöí äóİúÓöåóÇ æóãóÇáöß»</div><br>  (The best women is she who when you look at her, she pleases you, when you command her she obeys you, and when you are absent, she protects her honor and your property.) Then, the Messenger of Allah recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÑøöÌóÇáõ ŞóæøóÇãõæäó Úóáóì ÇáäøöÓóÂÁö</div><br>  (Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, ) until its end. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÕóáøóÊö ÇáúãóÑúÃóÉõ ÎóãúÓóåóÇ¡ æóÕóÇãóÊú ÔóåúÑóåóÇ¡ æóÍóİöÙóÊú İóÑúÌóåóÇ¡ æóÃóØóÇÚóÊú ÒóæúÌóåóÇ¡ Şöíáó áóåóÇ: ÇÏúÎõáöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ãöäú Ãóíøö ÇáúÃóÈúæóÇÈö ÔöÆúÊ»</div><br>  (If the woman prayed her five daily prayers, fasted her month, protected her chastity and obeyed her husband, she will be told, 'Enter Paradise from any of its doors you wish.') <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Dealing with the Wife's Ill-Conduct</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóÜÊöì ÊóÎóÇİõæäó äõÔõæÒóåõäøó</div><br>  (As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct,) meaning, the woman from whom you see ill conduct with her husband, such as when she acts as if she is above her husband, disobeys him, ignores him, dislikes him, and so forth. When these signs appear in a woman, her husband should advise her and remind her of Allah's torment if she disobeys him. Indeed, Allah ordered the wife to obey her husband and prohibited her from disobeying him, because of the enormity of his rights and all that he does for her. The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú ßõäúÊõ ÂãöÑğÇ ÃóÍóÏğÇ Ãóäú íóÓúÌõÏó áöÃóÍóÏò¡ áóÃóãóÑúÊõ ÇáúãóÑúÃóÉó Ãóäú ÊóÓúÌõÏó áöÒóæúÌöåóÇ¡ ãöäú ÚöÙóãö ÍóŞøöåö ÚóáóíúåóÇ»</div><br>  (If I were to command anyone to prostrate before anyone, I would have commanded the wife to prostrate before her husband, because of the enormity of his right upon her.) Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÏóÚóÇ ÇáÑøóÌõáõ ÇãúÑóÃóÊóåõ Åöáì İöÑóÇÔöåö İóÃóÈóÊú Úóáóíúåö¡ áóÚóäóÊúåóÇ ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉõ ÍóÊøóì ÊõÕúÈöÍ»</div><br>  (If the man asks his wife to come to his bed and she declines, the angels will keep cursing her until the morning.) Muslim recorded it with the wording,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÈóÇÊóÊö ÇáúãóÑúÃóÉõ åóÇÌöÑóÉğ İöÑóÇÔó ÒóæúÌöåóÇ¡ áóÚóäóÊúåóÇ ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉõ ÍóÊøóì ÊõÕúÈöÍ»</div><br>  (If the wife goes to sleep while ignoring her husband's bed, the angels will keep cursing her until the morning.) This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóÜÊöì ÊóÎóÇİõæäó äõÔõæÒóåõäøó İóÚöÙõæåõäøó</div><br>  (As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct, admonish them (first)).  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇåúÌõÑõæåõäøó İöì ÇáúãóÖóÇÌöÚö</div><br>  (abandon them in their beds,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said "The abandonment refers to not having intercourse with her, to lie on her bed with his back to her.'' Several others said similarly. As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak, `Ikrimah, and Ibn `Abbas, in another narration, added, "Not to speak with her or talk to her.'' The Sunan and Musnad compilers recorded that Mu`awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said, "O Allah's Messenger! What is the right that the wife of one of us has on him'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóäú ÊõØúÚöãóåóÇ ÅöĞóÇ ØóÚöãúÊó¡ æóÊóßúÓõæóåóÇ ÅöĞóÇ ÇßúÊóÓóíúÊó¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÖúÑöÈö ÇáúæóÌúåó¡ æóáóÇ ÊõŞóÈøöÍú¡ æóáóÇ ÊóåúÌõÑú ÅöáøóÇ İöí ÇáúÈóíúÊ»</div><br>  (To feed her when you eat, cloth her when you buy clothes for yourself, refrain from striking her face or cursing her, and to not abandon her, except in the house.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÖúÑöÈõæåõäøó</div><br>  (beat them) means, if advice and ignoring her in the bed do not produce the desired results, you are allowed to discipline the wife, without severe beating. Muslim recorded that Jabir said that during the Farewell Hajj, the Prophet said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇÊøóŞõæÇ Çááåó İöí ÇáäøöÓóÇÁö¡ İóÅöäøóåõäøó ÚöäúÏóßõãú ÚóæóÇäò¡ æóáóßõãú Úóáóíúåöäøó Ãóäú áóÇ íõæØöÆúäó İõÑõÔóßõãú ÃóÍóÏğÇ ÊóßúÑóåõæäóåõ¡İóÅöäú İóÚóáúäó Ğóáößó İóÇÖúÑöÈõæåõäøó ÖóÑúÈğÇ ÛóíúÑó ãõÈóÑöÍò¡ æóáóåõäøó Úóáóíúßõãú ÑöÒúŞõåõäøó æóßöÓúæóÊõåõäøó ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİ»</div><br>  (Fear Allah regarding women, for they are your assistants. You have the right on them that they do not allow any person whom you dislike to step on your mat. However, if they do that, you are allowed to discipline them lightly. They have a right on you that you provide them with their provision and clothes, in a reasonable manner.) Ibn `Abbas and several others said that the Ayah refers to a beating that is not violent. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it means, a beating that is not severe. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>When the Wife Obeys Her Husband, Means of Annoyance Against Her are Prohibited</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäú ÃóØóÚúäóßõãú İóáÇó ÊóÈúÛõæÇú Úóáóíúåöäøó ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance),) meaning, when the wife obeys her husband in all that Allah has allowed, then no means of annoyance from the husband are allowed against his wife. Therefore, in this case, the husband does not have the right to beat her or shun her bed. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ßóÇäó ÚóáöíøÇğ ßóÈöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.) reminds men that if they transgress against their wives without justification, then Allah, the Ever Most High, Most Great, is their Protector, and He will exert revenge on those who transgress against their wives and deal with them unjustly.  </div></body></html>
