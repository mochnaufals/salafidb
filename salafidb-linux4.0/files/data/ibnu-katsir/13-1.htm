We stated that every Surah that starts with separate letters, affirms that the Qur'an is miraculous and is an evidence that it is a revelation from Allah, and that there is no doubt or denying in this fact. This is why Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÂíóÜÊõ ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö</div><br>  (These are the verses of the Book), the Qur'an, which Allah described afterwards,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöì ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúßó</div><br>  (and that which has been revealed unto you), O Muhammad,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ÑóÈøößó ÇáúÍóŞøõ</div><br>  (from your Lord is the truth,) Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöäøó ÃóßúËóÑó ÇáäøóÇÓö áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (but most men believe not.) just as He said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóßúËóÑõ ÇáäøóÇÓö æóáóæú ÍóÑóÕúÊó ÈöãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.) 12:103 Allah declares that even after this clear, plain and unequivocal explanation (the Qur'an), most men will still not believe, due to their rebellion, stubbornness and hypocrisy.  </div></body></html>
