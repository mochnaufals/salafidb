Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú äóÔóÂÁõ áóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ãöäßõãú ãøóáóÜÆößóÉğ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö íóÎúáõİõæäó </div><br>  (And if it were Our will, We would have made angels to replace you on the earth) 43:60, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÌúÚóáõßõãú ÍõáóİóÂÁó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (And makes you inheritors of the Earth, generations after generations.) 27:62, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöí ÌóÇÚöáñ İöì ÇáÃóÑúÖö ÎóáöíİóÉğ</div><br>  (Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.) 2:30, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÓóì ÑóÈøõßõãú Ãóä íõåúáößó ÚóÏõæøóßõãú æóíóÓúÊóÎúáöİóßõãú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö İóíóäÙõÑó ßóíúİó ÊóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors on the earth, so that He may see how you act.) 7:129 Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóİóÚó ÈóÚúÖóßõãú İóæúŞó ÈóÚúÖò ÏóÑóÌóÜÊò</div><br>  (And He has raised you in ranks, some above others,) means, He has made you different from each other with regards to provision, conduct, qualities, evilness, shapes, color of skin, and so forth, and He has the perfect wisdom in all this. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÍúäõ ŞóÓóãúäóÇ Èóíúäóåõãú ãøóÚöíÔóÊóåõãú İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÑóİóÚúäóÇ ÈóÚúÖóåõãú İóæúŞó ÈóÚúÖò ÏóÑóÌóÜÊò áøöíóÊøóÎöĞó ÈóÚúÖõåõã ÈóÚúÖÇğ ÓõÎúÑöíøÇğ</div><br>  (It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world, and We raised some of them above others in ranks, so that some may employ others in their work.) 43:32, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇäÙõÑú ßóíúİó İóÖøóáúäóÇ ÈóÚúÖóåõãú Úóáóì ÈóÚúÖò æóáóáÇøñÎöÑóÉõ ÃóßúÈóÑõ ÏóÑóÌóÜÊò æóÃóßúÈóÑõ ÊóİúÖöíáÇğ </div><br>  (See how We prefer one above another (in this world), and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment.) 17:21 Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíóÈúáõæóßõãú İöì ãóÂ ÁóÇÊóÜßõã</div><br>  (that He may try you in that which He has bestowed on you.) means, so that He tests you in what He has granted you, for Allah tries the rich concerning his wealth and will ask him about how he appreciated it. He also tries the poor concerning his poverty and will ask him about his patience with it. Muslim recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÍõáúæóÉñ ÎóÖöÑóÉñ æóÅöäøó Çááåó ãõÓúÊóÎúáöİõßõãú İöíåóÇ İóäóÇÙöÑñ ãóÇĞóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó¡ İóÇÊøóŞõæÇ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÇÊøóŞõæÇ ÇáäøöÓóÇÁó İóÅöäøó Ãóæøóáó İöÊúäóÉö Èóäöí ÅöÓúÑóÇÆöíáó ßóÇäóÊú İöí ÇáäøöÓóÇÁ»</div><br>  (Verily, this life is beautiful and green, and Allah made you dwell in it generation after generation so that He sees what you will do. Therefore, beware of this life and beware of women, for the first trial that the Children of Israel suffered from was with women.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó ÓóÑöíÚõ ÇáúÚöŞóÇÈö æóÅöäøóåõ áóÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (Surely, your Lord is swift in retribution, and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) this is both discouragement and encouragement, by reminding the believers that Allah is swift in reckoning and punishment with those who disobey Him and defy His Messengers,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõ áóÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (And certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) for those who take Him as protector and follow His Messengers in the news and commandments they conveyed. Allah often mentions these two attributes together in the Qur'an. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ÑóÈøóßó áóĞõæ ãóÛúİöÑóÉò áøöáäøóÇÓö Úóáóì Ùõáúãöåöãú æóÅöäøó ÑóÈøóßó áóÔóÏöíÏõ ÇáúÚöŞóÇÈö</div><br>  (But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrongdoing. And verily, your Lord is (also) severe in punishment) 13:6, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÈøöìÁú ÚöÈóÇÏöì Ãóäøöì ÃóäóÇ ÇáúÛóİõæÑõ ÇáÑøóÍöíãõ - æóÃóäøó ÚóĞóÇÈöì åõæó ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ ÇáÇøñáöíãõ </div><br>  (Declare unto My servants, that truly, I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. And that My torment is indeed the most painful torment.) 15:49-50 There are similar Ayat that contain encouragement and discouragement. Sometimes Allah calls His servants to Him with encouragement, describing Paradise and making them eager for what He has with Him. Sometimes, He calls His servants with discouragement, mentioning the Fire and its torment and punishment, as well as, the Day of Resurrection and its horrors. Sometimes Allah mentions both so that each person is affected by it according to his or her qualities. We ask Allah that He makes us among those who obey what He has commanded, avoid what He has prohibited, and believe in Him as He has informed. Certainly, He is Near, hears and answers the supplication, and He is the Most Kind, Generous and Bestowing. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú íóÚúáóãõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõ ãóÇ ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ãöäó ÇáúÚõŞõæÈóÉö ãóÇ ØóãöÚó ÈöÌóäøóÊöåö ÃóÍóÏñ¡ æóáóæú íóÚúáóãõ ÇáúßóÇİöÑõ ãóÇÇöÚäúÏó Çááåö ãöäó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÉö ãóÇ ŞóäóØó ÃóÍóÏñ ãöäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ ÎóáóŞó Çááåõ ãöÇÆóÉó ÑóÍúãóÉò İóæóÖóÚó æóÇÍöÏóÉğ Èóíúäó ÎóáúŞöåö íóÊóÑóÇÍóãõæäó ÈöåóÇ æóÚöäúÏó Çááåö ÊöÓúÚóÉñ æóÊöÓúÚõæä»</div><br>  (If the believer knew Allah's punishment, no one will hope in entering His Paradise. And if the disbeliever knew Allah's mercy, no one will feel hopeless of acquiring Paradise. Allah created a hundred kinds of mercy. He sent down one of them to His creation, and they are merciful to each other on that account. With Allah, there remains ninety-nine kinds of mercy.)  Muslim and At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith, At-Tirmidhi said "Hasan''. Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóãøóÇ ÎóáóŞó Çááåõ ÇáúÎóáúŞó ßóÊóÈó İöí ßöÊóÇÈò İóåõæó ÚöäúÏóåõ İóæúŞó ÇáúÚóÑúÔö Åöäøó ÑóÍúãóÊöí ÊóÛúáöÈõ ÛóÖóÈöí»</div><br>  (When Allah created the creation, He wrote in a Book, and this Book is with Him above the Throne: `My mercy overcomes My anger.') This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-An`am, all the thanks and appreciation for Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
