O People of the Scripture! Now has come to you Our Messenger making (things) clear unto you, after a break in (the series of) Messengers, lest you say: "There came to us no bringer of glad tidings and no warner.'' But now has come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a warner. And Allah is able to do all things. ) Allah is addressing the People of the Book -- the Jews and the Christians, saying that He has sent His Messenger Muhammad to them, the Final Prophet, after whom there will be no Prophet or Messenger. Rather, He is the Final Messenger who came after a long time passed between him and `Isa, son of Maryam peace be upon them. There is a difference of opinion about the length of time between `Isa and Muhammad . Abu `Uthman An-Nahdi and Qatadah were reported to have said that this period was six hundred years. Al-Bukhari also recorded this opinion from Salman Al-Farisi. Qatadah said that this period was five hundred and sixty years, while Ma`mar said that it is five hundred and forty years. Some said that this period is six hundred and twenty years. There is no contradiction here if we consider the fact that those who said that this period was six hundred years were talking about solar years, while the second refers to lunar years, since there is a difference of about three years between every one hundred lunar and solar years. As in Allah's statement,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÈöËõæÇú İöì ßóåúİöåöãú ËóáÇËó ãöÆóÉò Óöäöíäó æóÇÒúÏóÇÏõæÇú ÊöÓúÚğÇ </div><br>  (And they stayed in their Cave three hundred years, adding nine.) meaning, nine more lunar years to substitute for the difference between lunar and solar years, thus agreeing with the three hundred years that the People of the Book knew about. We should assert again that the time period we mentioned here was between `Isa, the last Prophet to the Children of Israel, and Muhammad , the Last Prophet and Messenger among the children of Adam. In the Sahih collected by Al-Bukhari, Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Ãóæúáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö ÈöÇÈúäö ãóÑúíóãó áóÃóäóÇ¡ áóíúÓó Èóíúäöí æóÈóíúäóåõ äóÈöí»</div><br>  (I, among all people, have the most right to the son of Maryam, for there was no Prophet between Him and I.) This Hadith refutes the opinion of Al-Quda`i and others, that there was a Prophet after `Isa called Khalid bin Sinan.  Allah sent Muhammad after a period of time during which there was no Prophet, clear path, or unchanged religions. Idol worshipping, fire worshipping and cross worshipping flourished during this time. Therefore, the bounty of sending Muhammad was the perfect bounty at a time when he was needed the most. Evil had filled the earth by then, and tyranny and ignorance had touched all the servants, except a few of those who remained loyal to the true teachings of previous Prophets, such as some Jewish rabbis, Christian priests and Sabian monks. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Iyad bin Himar Al-Mujash`i said that the Prophet gave a speech one day and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÅöäøó ÑóÈøöí ÃóãóÑóäöí Ãóäú ÃõÚóáøöãóßõãú ãóÇ ÌóåöáúÊõãú ãöãøóÇ Úóáøóãóäöí İöí íóæúãöí åóĞóÇ¡ ßõáøõ ãóÇáò äóÍóáúÊõåõ ÚöÈóÇÏöí ÍóáóÇáñ¡ æóÅöäøöí ÎóáóŞúÊõ ÚöÈóÇÏöí ÍõäóİóÇÁó ßõáøóåõãú¡ æóÅöäøó ÇáÔøóíóÇØöíäó ÃóÊóÊúåõãú İóÃóÖóáøóÊúåõãú Úóäú Ïöíäöåöãú¡ æóÍóÑøóãóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ãóÇ ÃóÍúáóáúÊõ áóåõãú¡ æóÃóãóÑóÊúåõãú Ãóäú íõÔúÑößõæÇ Èöí ãóÇ áóãú ÃõäóÒøöáú Èöåö ÓõáúØóÇäğÇ¡ Ëõãøó Åöäøó Çááåó ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó äóÙóÑó Åöáì Ãóåúáö ÇáúÃóÑúÖö İóãŞóÊóåõãú ÚóÑóÈóåõãú æÚóÌóãóåõãú¡ ÅöáøóÇ ÈóŞóÇíóÇ ãöäú Èóäöí ÅöÓúÑóÇÆöíáó¡ æŞóÇáó: ÅöäøóãóÇ ÈóÚóËúÊõßó áöÃóÈúÊóáöíóßó æóÃóÈúÊóáöíó Èößó¡ æóÃóäúÒóáúÊõ Úóáóíúßó ßöÊóÇÈğÇ áóÇ íóÛúÓöáõåõ ÇáúãóÇÁõ¡ÊóŞúÑóÃõåõ äóÇÆöãğÇ æóíóŞúÙóÇäó¡ Ëõãøó Åöäøó Çááåó ÃóãóÑóäöí Ãóäú ÃõÍóÑøöŞó ŞõÑóíúÔğÇ İóŞõáúÊõ: íóÇÑóÈøö ÅöĞóäú íóËúáóÛõæÇ ÑóÃúÓöí¡ İóíóÏóÚõæåõ ÎõÈúÒóÉğ¡ İóŞóÇáó: ÇÓúÊóÎúÑöÌúåõãú ßóãóÇ ÇÓúÊóÎúÑóÌõæßó¡ æÇÛúÒõåõãú äõÛúÒößó¡ æóÃóäúİöŞú Úóáóíúåöãú İóÓóäõäúİöŞó Úóáóíúßó¡ æóÇÈúÚóËú ÌóíúÔğÇ äóÈúÚóËú ÎóãúÓğÇ ÃóãúËóÇáóåõ¡ æóŞóÇÊöáú Èöãóäú ÃóØóÇÚóßó ãóäú ÚóÕóÇßó¡ æóÃóåúáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ËóáóÇËóÉñ: Ğæõ ÓõáúØÇäò ãõŞúÓöØñ ãõæóİøóŞñ ãõÊóÕóÏøöŞñ¡ æóÑóÌõáñ ÑóÍöíãñ ÑóŞöíŞõ ÇáúŞóáúÈö Èößõáøö Ğöí ŞõÑúÈóì æóãõÓúáöãò¡ æóÑóÌõáñ Úóİöíİñ İóŞöíÑñ Ğõæ ÚöíóÇáò (ãõÊóÕóÏøöŞñ). æóÃóåúáõ ÇáäøóÇÑö ÎóãúÓóÉñ: ÇáÖøóÚöíİõ ÇáøóĞí áóÇ Ïöíäó áóåõ¡ æóÇáøóĞöíä åõãú İöíßõãú ÊóÈóÚñ Ãóæú ÊóÈóÚğÇ Ôóßøó íóÍúíì áóÇ íóÈúÊóÛõæä ÃóåúáğÇ æóáóÇ ãóÇáğÇ¡ æóÇáúÎóÇÆöäõ ÇáøóĞöí áóÇ íóÎúİóì áóåõ ØóãóÚñ æóÅöäú ÏóŞøó ÅöáøóÇ ÎóÇäóåõ¡ æóÑóÌõáñ áóÇ íõÕúÈöÍõ æóáóÇ íõãúÓöí ÅöáøóÇ æóåõæó íõÎóÇÏöÚõßó Úóäú Ãóåúáößó æóãóÇáößó æóĞóßóÑó ÇáúÈóÎöíáó Ãóæö ÇáúßóĞøóÇÈó æóÇáÔøöäúÙöíÑó: ÇáİóÇÍöÔ»</div><br>  (My Lord has commanded me to teach you what you have no knowledge of and of which He taught me this day, `All the wealth that I gave to My servants is permissible. I created all My servants Hunafa (monotheists). But, the devils came to them and deviated them from their religion, prohibited for them what I allowed and commanded them to associate others with Me in worship, which I gave no permission for.' Then Allah looked at the people of the earth and disliked them all, the Arabs and non-Arabs among them, except a few from among the Children of Israel. Allah said (to me), `I only sent you to test you and to test with you. I sent to you a Book that cannot be washed by water (it is eternal), and you will read it while asleep and while awake.' Allah has also Commanded me to burn (destroy) Quraysh. So I said, `O Lord! They will smash my head and leave it like a piece of bread.' He said, `I will drive them out as they drove you out, and when you invade them We will help you. Spend on them (your companions) and We will spend on you, send an army and We will send five armies like it (in its support). Fight with those who obey you, against those who disobey you. And the inhabitants of Paradise are three: a just, prosperous, and charitable ruler; A merciful man who has a kind heart toward every relative and every Muslim; a forgiving, poor man with dependants who is charitable. And the inhabitants of the Fire are five: the weak one with no religion; those who follow after you not for family reasons nor wealth; and the treacherous who does not hide his treachery, acting treacherous in even the most insignificant matters; and a person who comes every morning and every evening, is cheating your family or your wealth.') And he mentioned the stingy, or the liar, and the foulmouthed person.'' Therefore, the Hadith states that Allah looked at the people of the earth and disliked them all, both the Arabs and non-Arabs among them, except a few among the Children of Israel, or a few among the People of the Book as Muslim recorded. The religion was distorted and changed for the people of the earth until Allah sent Muhammad , and Allah, thus, guided the creatures and took them away from the darkness to the light and placed them on a clear path and a glorious Law.
