And on the Day when He will gather them together (and say): "O you assembly of Jinn! Many did you mislead of men," and their friends among the people will say: "Our Lord!

Al-Hasan commented, "They benefited from each other when the Jinns merely commanded and mankind obeyed.'' Ibn Jurayj said, "During the time of Jahiliyyah, a man would reach a land and proclaim, `I seek refuge with the master (Jinn) of this valley,' and this is how they benefited from each other. They used this as an excuse for them on the Day of Resurrection.'' Therefore, the Jinns benefit from humans since humans revere the Jinns by invoking them for help. The Jinns would then proclaim, "We became the masters of both mankind and the Jinns.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóáóÛúäóÂ ÃóÌóáóäóÇ ÇáøóĞöì ÃóÌøóáúÊó áóäóÇ</div><br>  (but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us.) meaning, death, according to As-Suddi.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÇáäøóÇÑõ ãóËúæóÇßõãú</div><br>  (He (Allah) will say: "The Fire be your dwelling place...'') where you will reside and live, you and your friends,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÂ</div><br>  (you will dwell therein forever. ) and will never depart except what Allah may will.  </div></body></html>
