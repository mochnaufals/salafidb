He also informs them that whoever reforms himself, he would not be affected by the wickedness of the wicked, whether they were his relatives or otherwise. Imam Ahmad recorded that Qays said, "Abu Bakr As-Siddiq stood up, thanked Allah and praised Him and then said, `O people!

I (Qays) also heard Abu Bakr say, `O people! Beware of lying, for lying contradicts faith.'''  </div></body></html>
