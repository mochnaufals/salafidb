Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said about his Lord,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßõãú ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó ÑóÍöíãñ ãóäú åóãøó ÈöÍóÓóäóÉò İóáóãú íóÚúãóáúåóÇ ßõÊöÈóÊú áóåõ ÍóÓóäóÉğ İóÅöäú ÚóãöáóåóÇ ßõÊöÈóÊú áóåõ ÚóÔúÑğÇ Åöáóì ÓóÈúÚöãöÇÆóÉò Åöáóì ÃóÖúÚóÇİò ßóËöíÑóÉò. æóãóäú åóãøó ÈöÓóíøöÆóÉò İóáóãú íóÚúãóáúåóÇ ßõÊöÈóÊú áóåõ ÍóÓóäóÉğ İóÅöäú ÚóãöáóåóÇ ßõÊöÈóÊú áóåõ æóÇÍöÏóÉğ Ãóæú íóãúÍõæåóÇ Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó æóáóÇ íóåúáößõ Úóáóì Çááåö ÅöáøóÇ åóÇáöß»</div><br>  (Your Lord is Most Merciful. Whoever intends to perform a good deed and does not do it, it will be written for him as a good deed. If he performs it, it will be written for him as ten deeds, to seven hundred, to multifold. Whoever intends to commit an evil deed, but does not do it, it will be written for him as a good deed. If he commits it, it will be written for him as a sin, unless Allah erases it. Only those who deserve destruction will be destroyed by Allah.) Al-Bukhari, Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith.  Ahmad also recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó:ãóäú Úóãöáó ÍóÓóäóÉğ İóáóåõ ÚóÔúÑõ ÃóãúËóÇáöåóÇ æóÃóÒöíÏõ æóãóäú Úóãöáó ÓóíøöÆóÉğ İóÌóÒóÇÄõåóÇ ãöËúáõåóÇ Ãóæú ÃóÛúİöÑõ æóãóäú Úóãöáó ŞõÑóÇÈó ÇáúÃóÑúÖö ÎóØöíÆóÉğ Ëõãøó áóŞöíóäöí áóÇ íõÔúÑößõ Èöí ÔóíúÆğÇ ÌóÚóáúÊõ áóåõ ãöËúáóåóÇ ãóÛúİöÑóÉğ¡ æóãóäö ÇŞúÊóÑóÈó Åöáíøó ÔöÈúÑğÇ ÇŞúÊóÑóÈúÊõ Åöáóíúåö ĞöÑóÇÚğÇ æóãóäö ÇŞúÊóÑóÈó Åöáóíøó ĞöÑóÇÚğÇ ÇŞúÊóÑóÈúÊõ Åöáóíúåö ÈóÇÚğÇ æóãóäú ÃóÊóÇäöí íóãúÔöí ÃóÊóíúÊõåõ åóÑúæóáóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah says, `Whoever performs a good deed, will have tenfold for it and more. Whoever commits a sin, then his recompense will be the same, unless I forgive. Whoever commits the earth's fill of sins and then meets Me while associating none with Me, I will give him its fill of forgiveness. Whoever draws closer to Me by a hand's span, I will draw closer to him by a forearm's length. Whoever draws closer to Me by a forearm's length, I will draw closer to him by an arm's length. And whoever comes to Me walking, I will come to him running.') Muslim also collected this Hadith. Know that there are three types of people who refrain from committing a sin that they intended. There are those who refrain from committing the sin because they fear Allah, and thus will have written for them a good deed as a reward. This type contains both a good intention and a good deed. In some narrations of the Sahih, Allah says about this type, "He has left the sin for My sake.'' Another type does not commit the sin because of forgetfulness or being busy attending to other affairs. This type of person will neither earn a sin, nor a reward. The reason being that, this person did not intend to do good, nor commit evil. Some people abandon the sin because they were unable to commit it or due to laziness, after trying to commit it and seeking the means that help commit it. This person is just like the person who commits the sin. There is an authentic Hadith that states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÇáúÊóŞóì ÇáúãõÓúáöãóÇäö ÈöÓóíúİóíúåöãóÇ İóÇáúŞóÇÊöáõ æóÇáúãóŞúÊõæáõ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (When two Muslims meet with their swords, then the killer and the killed will be in the Fire.) They said, "O Allah's Messenger! We know about the killer, so what about the killed'' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÍóÑöíÕğÇ Úóáóì ŞóÊúáö ÕóÇÍöÈöå»</div><br>  (He was eager to kill his companion.) Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani said that Abu Malik Al-Ash`ari said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉõ ßóİøóÇÑóÉñ áöãóÇ ÈóíúäóåóÇ æóÈóíúäó ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö ÇáøóÊöí ÊóáöíåóÇ æóÒöíóÇÏóÉõ ËóáóÇËóÉö ÃóíøóÇãò¡ æóĞóáößó áÃóäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì ŞóÇáó:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä ÌóÂÁó ÈöÇáúÍóÓóäóÉö İóáóåõ ÚóÔúÑõ ÃóãúËóÇáöåóÇ</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>»</div><br>  (Friday (prayer) to the next Friday (preayer), plus three more days, erase whatever was committed (of sins) between them. This is because Allah says: Whoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit) Abu Dharr narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÕóÇãó ËóáóÇËóÉó ÃóíøóÇãò ãöäú ßõáøö ÔóåúÑò İóŞóÏú ÕóÇãó ÇáÏøóåúÑó ßõáøóå»</div><br>  (Whoever fasts three days every month, will have fasted all the time.) Ahmad, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith, and this is Ahmad's wording. At-Tirmidhi also recorded it with this addition;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İÃäÒá Çááå ÊÕÏíŞ Ğáß İí ßÊÇÈå»</div><br>  (So Allah sent down affirmation of this statement in His Book, )   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä ÌóÂÁó ÈöÇáúÍóÓóäóÉö İóáóåõ ÚóÔúÑõ ÃóãúËóÇáöåóÇ</div><br>  (Whoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit,)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çáíæã ÈÚÔÑÉ ÃíÇã»</div><br>  (Therefore, a day earns ten days.) At-Tirmidhi said; "This Hadith is Hasan''. There are many other Hadiths and statements on this subject, but what we mentioned should be sufficient, Allah willing, and our trust is in Him.  </div></body></html>
