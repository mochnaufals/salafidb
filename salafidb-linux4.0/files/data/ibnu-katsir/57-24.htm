Qatadah commented on this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÂ ÃóÕóÇÈó ãöä ãøõÕöíÈóÉò İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (No calamity occurs on the earth) refers to famine, while,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó İöì ÃóäİõÓößõãú</div><br>  (or nor in yourselves) refers to suffering and diseases.'' He also said, "We were told that every person who suffers a prick of a thorn, a twisted ankle, or a bleeding vein, has it occur on account of his sins. What Allah forgives is even more.'' This great, honorable Ayah provides clear evidence to the misguidance of the cursed Qadariyyah sect, who deny Allah's Preordaihnent and His knowledge of everything before it occurs. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ŞóÏøóÑó Çááåõ ÇáúãóŞóÇÏöíÑó ŞóÈáó Ãóäú íóÎúáõŞó ÇáÓøóãæóÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖó ÈöÎóãúÓöíäó Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah ordained the measures (of everything) fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.)'' Muslim collected this Hadith in his Sahih with the addition:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóßóÇäó ÚóÑúÔõåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÇÁ»</div><br>  (And His Throne was over the water.) At-Tirmidhi also collected it and said, "Hasan Sahih.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Ğáößó Úóáóì Çááøóåö íóÓöíÑñ</div><br>  (Verily, that is easy for Allah.) means that He knows all things before they occur, and He records them exactly as they will occur when they occur, and this is easy for Him. Verily, Allah knows what happened, what will happen and what did not happen, and what shape and form it will take if it were to happen. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Ordering Patience and Gratitude</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøößóíúáÇó ÊóÃúÓóæúÇú Úóáóì ãóÇ İóÇÊóßõãú æóáÇó ÊóİúÑóÍõæÇú ÈöãóÂ ÁóÇÊóÜßõãú</div><br>  (In order that you may not grieve at the things over that you fail to get, nor rejoice over that which has been given to you.) meaning, `We informed you of Our encompassing knowledge, recording all things before they occur and creating all things in due measure known to Us, so that you may know that what has met you would never have missed you and what has missed you would never have met you. Therefore, do not grieve for what you have missed of fortune, because had it been destined for you, you would have achieved it.' (It is also recited:) (æóáóÇ ÊóİúÑóÍõæúÇ ÈöãóÇ ÃóÊóÇßõãú) (nor rejoice over that which came to you) meaning, come to you. According to the recitation,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÁóÇÊóÜßõãõ</div><br>  it means (which has been given to you.) Both meanings are related. Allah says here, `do not boast before people about what Allah has favored you with, because it is not you who earned it by your efforts. Rather, all this came your way because Allah destined them for you and provided them for you as provisions. Therefore, do not use what Allah has granted you as a reason to boast and become arrogant with others.' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ áÇó íõÍöÈøõ ßõáøó ãõÎúÊóÇáò İóÎõæÑò</div><br>  (And Allah likes not prideful boasters.) meaning, who acts arrogantly with other people. `Ikrimah commented by saying, "Everyone of us feels happiness and grief. However, make your joy with gratitude and endure your grief with patience.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Censuring the Stinginess</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÈúÎóáõæäó æóíóÃúãõÑõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓó ÈöÇáúÈõÎúáö</div><br>  (Those who are misers and enjoin miserliness upon people.) meaning those who commit evil and encourage people to commit it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÊóæóáøó</div><br>  (And whosoever turns away,) from abiding by Allah's commandments and obeying Him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó åõæó ÇáúÛóäöìøõ ÇáúÍóãöíÏõ</div><br>  (then Allah is Rich, Worthy of all praise.) As Musa, peace be upon him, said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊóßúİõÑõæÇú ÃóäÊõãú æóãóä İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÌóãöíÚğÇ İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó áóÛóäöìøñ ÍóãöíÏñ</div><br>  (If you disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then verily, Allah is Rich, Owner of all praise.)(14:8)  </div></body></html>
