Then I met `Ikrimah, the freed slave of Ibn `Abbas, and informed him (about it), and he forbade me strongly from doing so (i.e., to enlist in that army), and then he said to me, `Ibn `Abbas told me that some Muslims used to go out with the idolators increasing the size of their army against the Messenger of Allah . Then, an arrow would hit one of them and kill him, or he would be struck on his neck (with a sword) and killed, and Allah sent down the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóæóİøóÜåõãõ ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ ÙóÜáöãöì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú</div><br>  (Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves).'' Ad-Dahhak stated that this Ayah was revealed about some hypocrites who did not join the Messenger of Allah but remained in Makkah and went out with the idolators for the battle of Badr. They were killed among those who were killed. Thus, this honorable Ayah was revealed about those who reside among the idolators, while able to perform Hijrah and unable to practice the faith. Such people will be committing injustice against themselves and falling into a prohibition according to the consensus and also according to this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÊóæóİøóÜåõãõ ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ ÙóÜáöãöì ÃóäİõÓöåöãú</div><br>  (Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves,) by refraining from Hijrah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú İöíãó ßõäÊõãú</div><br>  (They (angels) say (to them): "In what (condition) were you'') meaning, why did you remain here and not perform Hijrah   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú ßõäøóÇ ãõÓúÊóÖúÚóİöíäó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (They reply: "We were weak and oppressed on the earth.'') meaning, we are unable to leave the land or move about in the earth,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáúæÇú Ãóáóãú Êóßõäú ÃóÑúÖõ Çááøóåö æóÓöÚóÉğ</div><br>  (They (angels) say: "Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you).  Abu Dawud recorded that Samurah bin Jundub said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÌóÇãóÚó ÇáúãõÔúÑößó æóÓóßóäó ãóÚóåõ İóÅöäøóåõ ãöËúáõå»</div><br>  (Whoever mingles with the idolator and resides with him, he is just like him.)  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÇáúãõÓúÊóÖúÚóİöíäó</div><br>  (Except the weak) until the end of the Ayah, is an excuse that Allah gives for this type of people not to emigrate, because they are unable to free themselves from the idolators. And even if they did, they would not know which way to go. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÓúÊóØöíÚõæäó ÍöíáóÉğ æóáÇó íóåúÊóÏõæäó ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (Who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way), meaning, they do not find the way to emigrate, as Mujahid, `Ikrimah and As-Suddi stated. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÚóÓóì Çááøóåõ Ãóä íóÚúİõæó Úóäúåõãú</div><br>  (These are they whom Allah is likely to forgive them,) means, pardon them for not migrating, and here, `likely' means He shall,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÚóİõæøÇğ ÛóİõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (and Allah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving). Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, "While the Messenger of Allah was praying `Isha', he said, `Sami` Allahu Liman Hamidah.' He then said before he prostrated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó ÃóäúÌö ÚóíøóÇÔó Èúäó ÃÈöí ÑóÈöíÚóÉó¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÃóäúÌö ÓóáóãóÉó Èúäó åöÔóÇãò¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÃóäúÌö ÇáúæóáöíÏó Èúäó ÇáúæóáöíÏö¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÃóäúÌö ÇáúãõÓúÊóÖúÚóİöíäó ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÇÔúÏõÏú æóØúÃóÊóßó Úóáóì ãõÖóÑó¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÇÌúÚóáúåóÇ Óöäöíäó ßóÓöäöí íõæÓõİ»</div><br>  (O Allah!

Afflict them with years (of famine) similar to the (famine) years of the time of Prophet Yusuf.)'' Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu An-Nu`man said that Hammad bin Zayd said that Ayyub narrated that Ibn Abi Mulaykah said that Ibn `Abbas commented on the verse,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÇáúãõÓúÊóÖúÚóİöíäó</div><br>  (Except the weak ones among men), "I and my mother were among those (weak ones) whom Allah excused.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõåóÇÌöÑú İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö íóÌöÏú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ãõÑóÇÛóãÇğ ßóËöíÑÇğ æóÓóÚóÉğ</div><br>  (He who emigrates in the cause of Allah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by.) this encourages the believers to perform Hijrah and abandon the idolators, for wherever the believer emigrates, he will find a safe refuge to resort to. Mujahid said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÑóÇÛóãÇğ ßóËöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (many dwelling places) means, he will find a way out of what he dislikes. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓöÚóÉğ</div><br>  (and plenty to live by.) refers to provision. Qatadah also said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÌöÏú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ãõÑóÇÛóãÇğ ßóËöíÑÇğ æóÓóÚóÉğ</div><br>  (...will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by.) means, Allah will take him from misguidance to guidance and from poverty to richness. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÎúÑõÌú ãöä ÈóíúÊöåö ãõåóÜÌöÑÇğ Åöáóì Çááøóåö æóÑóÓõæáöåö Ëõãøó íõÏúÑößúåõ ÇáúãóæúÊõ İóŞóÏú æóŞóÚó ÃóÌúÑõåõ Úóáìó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant unto Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is then surely, incumbent upon Allah. ) means, whoever starts emigrating and dies on the way, he will acquire the reward of those who emigrate for Allah. The Two Sahihs, along with the Musnad and Sunan compilers, recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöäøóãóÇ ÇáúÃóÚúãóÇáõ ÈöÇáäøöÜÜíøóÇÊö¡ æóÅöäøóãóÇ áößõáøö ÇãúÑöìÁò ãóÇ äóæóì¡ İóãóäú ßóÇäóÊú åöÌúÑóÊõåõ Åöáóì Çááåö æóÑóÓõæáöåö¡ İóåöÌúÑóÊõåõ Åöáóì Çááåö æóÑóÓõæáöåö¡ æóãóäú ßóÇäóÊú åöÌúÑóÊõåõ Åöáì ÏõäúíóÇ íõÕöíÈõåóÇ¡ Ãóæö ÇãúÑóÃóÉò íóÊóÒóæøóÌõåóÇ¡ İóåöÌúÑóÊõåõ Åöáì ãóÇ åóÇÌóÑó Åöáóíúå»</div><br>  (The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions, and every person will be rewarded according to what he has intended. So, whoever emigrated to Allah and His Messenger, then his emigration is for Allah and His Messenger. And whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration is for what he emigrated for.) This Hadith is general, it applies to Hijrah as well as every other deed. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that a man killed ninety-nine people and completed the number one hundred when he killed a worshipper. He then asked a scholar if he has a chance to repent. The scholar said, "What prevents you from repentance'' The scholar told the killer to emigrate from his land to another land where Allah is worshipped. When he left his land and started on the migration to the other land, death overtook him on the way. The angels of mercy and the angels of torment disputed about the man, whereas the former said that he went out in repentance, while the latter said that he did not arrive at his destination. They were commanded to measure the distance between the two lands and to whichever land he is closer to, he will be considered part of that land. Allah commanded that the righteous land to move closer and the land of evil to move farther. The angels found that he died closer to the land that he intended to emigrate to by a hand-span, and thus the angels of mercy captured his soul. In another narration, when death came to that man, he moved his chest towards the righteous village that he emigrated to.  </div></body></html>
