Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and others said: "Destruction.'' The meaning is that Allah is stating that these idolators will have no way of reaching the gods they claimed in this world. He will separate them in the Hereafter and neither party will have any means of reaching the other. There will be devastation, great horrors and other terrible things in between them. `Abdullah bin `Amr understood the pronoun in the phrase "between them" to refer to the believers and the disbelievers, meaning that the people of guidance and the people of misguidance will be separated. This then is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóæúãó ÊóŞõæãõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ íóæúãóÆöĞò íóÊóİóÑøóŞõæäó </div><br>  (And on the Day when the Hour will be established -- that Day shall (all men) be separated. ) 30:14   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãóÆöĞò íóÕøóÏøóÚõæäó</div><br>  (On that Day men shall be divided.) 30:43,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇãúÊóÇÒõæÇú Çáúíóæúãó ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúãõÌúÑöãõæäó </div><br>  ((It will be said), "And O you the criminals!
