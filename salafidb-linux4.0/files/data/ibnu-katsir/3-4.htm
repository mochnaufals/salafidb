We also explained the Tafsir of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çáã </div><br>  (Alif-Lam-Mim) in the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah, and the meaning of,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó ÇáúÍóìøõ ÇáúŞóíøõæãõ </div><br>  (Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa, Al-Hayyul-Qayyum) in the Tafsir of Ayat Al-Kursi. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÒøóáó Úóáóíúßó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (It is He Who has sent down the Book to you with truth, ) means, revealed the Qur'an to you, O Muhammad, in truth, meaning there is no doubt or suspicion that it is revealed from Allah. Verily, Allah revealed the Qur'an with His knowledge, and the angels testify to this fact, Allah is sufficient as a Witness. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÕóÏøöŞÇğ áøöãóÇ Èóíúäó íóÏóíúåö</div><br>  (Confirming what came before it) means, from the previous divinely revealed Books, sent to the servants and Prophets of Allah. These Books testify to the truth of the Qur'an, and the Qur'an also testifies to the truth these Books contained, including the news and glad tidings of Muhammad's prophethood and the revelation of the Glorious Qur'an.  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÒóáó ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉó</div><br>  (And He sent down the Tawrah) to Musa (Musa) son of `Imran,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÅöäÌöíáó</div><br>  (And the Injil), to `Isa, son of Mary,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (Aforetime) meaning, before the Qur'an was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõÏğì áøöáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (As a guidance to mankind) in their time.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÒóáó ÇáúİõÑúŞóÇäó</div><br>  (And He sent down the criterion) which is the distinction between misguidance, falsehood and deviation on one hand, and guidance, truth and piety on the other hand. This is because of the indications, signs, plain evidences and clear proofs that it contains, and because of its explanations, clarifications, etc.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÈöÃíóÜÊö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Truly, those who disbelieve in the Ayat of Allah) means they denied, refused and unjustly rejected them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈñ ÔóÏöíÏñ</div><br>  (For them there is a severe torment) on the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÚóÒöíÒñ</div><br>  (And Allah is All-Mighty) meaning, His grandeur is invincible and His sovereignty is infinite,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğõæ ÇäÊöŞóÇãò</div><br>  (All-Able of Retribution.) from those who reject His Ayat and defy His honorable Messengers and great Prophets.  </div></body></html>
