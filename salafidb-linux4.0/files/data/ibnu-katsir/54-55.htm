This description befits every disbeliever and innovator of all types and forms of sects.

Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it. And Who has measured (Qaddara) and then guided.)(87:1-3), i.e., He measured out the total sum (Qadar) of everything and then guided the creation to it. The Imams of the Sunnah relied on this honorable Ayah as evidence that Allah created the creation with destined limits before they were created. He knew everything that will occur before it occurred and recorded everything that will occur, before they occurred. They used this Ayah and similar Ayat and Hadiths to refute the Qadariyyah sect, who started their sect during the latter time of the Companions. I mentioned this subject in detail in my explanation on the chapter on faith of Sahih Al-Bukhari. I will mention here some Hadiths pertaining to this honorable Ayah. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, "The idolators of the Quraysh came to the Messenger of Allah arguing with him and discounting the Qadar. This Ayah was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íõÓúÍóÈõæäó İöì ÇáäøóÇÑö Úóáóì æõÌõæåöåöãú ĞõæŞõæÇú ãóÓøó ÓóŞóÑó - ÅöäøóÇ ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò ÎóáóŞúäóÜåõ ÈöŞóÏóÑò </div><br>  (The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: "Taste you the touch of Hell!'' Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)'' Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah collected this Hadith. Al-Bazzar recorded that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father narrated that his grandfather said, "These Ayat were revealed about those who deny Al-Qadar,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõÌúÑöãöíäó İöì ÖóáóÜáò æóÓõÚõÑò - íóæúãó íõÓúÍóÈõæäó İöì ÇáäøóÇÑö Úóáóì æõÌõæåöåöãú ĞõæŞõæÇú ãóÓøó ÓóŞóÑó </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò ÎóáóŞúäóÜåõ ÈöŞóÏóÑò </div><br>  (Verily, the criminals are in error and will burn. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire: "Taste you the touch of Hell!'' Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.)'' Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Zurarah said that his father said that the Prophet recited this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íõÓúÍóÈõæäó İöì ÇáäøóÇÑö Úóáóì æõÌõæåöåöãú ĞõæŞõæÇú ãóÓøó ÓóŞóÑó - ÅöäøóÇ ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò ÎóáóŞúäóÜåõ ÈöŞóÏóÑò </div><br>  ("Taste you the touch of Hell!'' Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) and then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÒóáóÊú İöí ÃõäóÇÓò ãöäú ÃõãøóÊöí íóßõæäõæäó İöí ÂÎöÑö ÇáÒøóãóÇäö íõßóĞøöÈõæäó ÈöŞóÏóÑö Çááå»</div><br>  (These Ayat were revealed about some members of my Ummah. They will come before the end of time and deny Al-Qadar.) Ata' bin Abi Rabah said, "I went to Ibn `Abbas and found him drawing water from the well of Zamzam. The bottom of his clothes were wet with the water of Zamzam and I said to him, `They talked about Al-Qadar (some denied it).' He asked, `Have they done this' I said, `Yes.' He said, `By Allah! This Ayah was revealed only about them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íõÓúÍóÈõæäó İöì ÇáäøóÇÑö Úóáóì æõÌõæåöåöãú ĞõæŞõæÇú ãóÓøó ÓóŞóÑó - ÅöäøóÇ ßõáøó ÔóìúÁò ÎóáóŞúäóÜåõ ÈöŞóÏóÑò </div><br>  ("Taste you the touch of Hell!'' Verily, We have created all things with Qadar.) They are the worst members of this Ummah. Do not visit those who fall ill among them or pray the Funeral prayer for those among them who die. If I saw one of them, I would pluck out his eyes with these two fingers of mine.''' Imam Ahmad recorded that Nafi` said, " `Abdullah bin `Umar had a friend in the area of Ash-Sham who used to write to him. `Abdullah bin `Umar wrote to him, `I was told that you started talking about Al-Qadar. Therefore, do not dare write to me any more. I heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Óóíóßõæäõ İöí ÃõãøóÊöí ÃóŞúæóÇãñ íõßóĞøöÈõæäó ÈöÇáúŞóÏóÑ»</div><br>  (There will be some members of my Ummah who will deny Al-Qadar.)'' Abu Dawud collected this Hadith from Ahmad bin Hanbal. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáøõ ÔóíúÁò ÈöŞóÏóÑò ÍóÊúì ÇáúÚóÌúÒõ æóÇáúßóíúÓ»</div><br>  (Every thing is predetermined, even laziness and intelligence.) Muslim collected this Hadith using a chain of narration through Imam Malik. There is also an authentic Hadith in which the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÓúÊóÚöäú ÈöÇááåö æóáóÇ ÊóÚúÌóÒú¡ İóÅöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóßó ÃóãúÑñ İóŞõáú: ŞóÏøóÑó Çááåõ æóãóÇ ÔóÇÁó İóÚóáó¡ æóáóÇ ÊóŞõáú: áóæú Ãóäøöí İóÚóáúÊõ ßóĞóÇ áóßóÇäó ßóĞóÇ¡ İóÅöäøó áóæú ÊóİúÊóÍõ Úóãóáó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇä»</div><br>  (Seek the help of Allah and do not succumb to feebleness. And when an affliction strikes you, say, "Allah has decreed this, and He does as He wills.'' Do not say, "Had I done this or that, this or that would have happened, because "if'' opens the door wide for the work of Ash-Shaytan.)'' In a Hadith from `Abbas, the Messenger of Allah said to him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇÚúáóãú Ãóäøó ÇáúÃõãøóÉó áóæö ÇÌúÊóãóÚõæÇ Úóáóì Ãóäú íóäúİóÚõæßó ÈöÔóíúÁò¡ áóãú íóßúÊõÈúåõ Çááåõ áóßó áóãú íóäúİóÚõæßó¡ æóáóæö ÇÌúÊóãóÚõæÇ Úóáóì Ãóäú íóÖõÑøõæßó ÈöÔóíúÁò¡ áóãú íóßúÊõÈúåõ Çááåõ Úóáóíúßó áóãú íóÖõÑøõæßó¡ ÌóİøóÊö ÇáúÃóŞúáóÇãõ æóØõæöíóÊö ÇáÕøõÍõİ»</div><br>  (Know that if the Ummah were to all gather their strength to cause you some benefit that Allah has not decreed for you, they will never be able to bring you that benefit. And if they gather their strength to bring a harm to you that Allah has not written on you, they will never be able to harm you. The pens have gone dry and the Books of Record have been closed.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ubadah bin Al-Walid bin Ubadah said that his father said to him, "I went to `Ubadah when he was ill, and I thought that he was going to die. So I said, `O my father, advise us and make the best effort in this regard.' He said, `Help me sit up,' and when he was helped up, he said, `O my son! Know that you will not taste the delight of Faith or earn true knowledge in Allah until you believe in Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it.' I asked, `O my father! How can I know (or believe in) Al-Qadar, the good and the not so good parts of it' He said, `When you know that what has missed you, would never have come to you and what has befallen you would never have missed you. O my son! I heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Ãóæøóáó ãóÇ ÎóáóŞó Çááåõ ÇáúŞóáóãõ¡ Ëõãøó ŞóÇáó áóåõ: ÇßúÊõÈú¡ İóÌóÑóì İöí Êöáúßó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÈöãóÇ åõæó ßóÇÆöäñ Åöáóì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (The first thing Allah created was the Pen, right after that commanded it, `Record!' and the Pen recorded everything that will occur until the Day of Resurrection.) O my son! If you die not having this belief, you will enter the Hellfire.''' At-Tirmidhi also recorded it and said: "Hasan Sahih Gharib.'' It is confirmed in Sahih Muslim from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ßóÊóÈó ãóŞóÇÏöíÑó ÇáúÎóáúŞö ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú íóÎúáõŞó ÇáÓøóãæóÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖó ÈöÎóãúÓöíäó Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉ»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah recorded the measurements for the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.) Ibn Wahb added,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÚóÑúÔõåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÂÁö</div><br>  (And His Throne was over the water.)(11:7) At-Tirmidhi also recorded it, and he said: "Hasan, Sahih Gharib.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>A Warning to beware of Allah's Threats</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóãúÑõäóÂ ÅöáÇøó æóÍöÏóÉñ ßóáóãúÍò ÈöÇáúÈóÕóÑö </div><br>  (And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.)

This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Iqtarabat (Al-Qamar). All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and success and immunity from error come from Him.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
