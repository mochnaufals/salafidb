Allah said: "Do you agree, and will you take up My covenant'' They said: "We agree.'' He said: "Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses.'') (3:81) This covenant was taken from them after their missions started. Elsewhere in the Qur'an, Allah mentions five by name, and these are the Mighty Messengers with strong resolve. They are also mentioned by name in this Ayah and in the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÔóÑóÚó áóßõã ãøöäó ÇáöÏöíäö ãóÇ æóÕøóì Èöåö äõæÍÇğ æóÇáøóĞöì ÃóæúÍóíúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó æóãóÇ æóÕøóíúäóÇ Èöåö ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãó æóãõæÓóì æóÚöíÓóì Ãóäú ÃóŞöíãõæÇú ÇáÏøöíäó æóáÇó ÊóÊóİóÑøóŞõæÇú İöíåö</div><br>  (He (Allah) has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh, and that which We have revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibrahim, Musa and `Isa saying you should establish religion and make no divisions in it.) (42:13) This is the covenant which Allah took from them, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ÃóÎóĞúäóÇ ãöäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíúäó ãöíËóÇŞóåõãú æóãöäúßó æóãöä äøõæÍò æóÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóãõæÓóì æóÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäö ãóÑúíóãó</div><br>  (And when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you, and from Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, and `Isa son of Maryam.) This Ayah begins with the last Prophet, as a token of respect, may the blessings of Allah be upon him, then the names of the other Prophets are given in order, may the blessings of Allah be upon them. Ibn `Abbas said: "The strong covenant is Al-`Ahd (the covenant).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíóÓúÃóáó ÇáÕøóÜÏöŞöíäó Úóä ÕöÏúŞöåöãú</div><br>  (That He may ask the truthful about their truth.) Mujahid said: "This refers to, those who convey the Message from the Messengers.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÚóÏøó áöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (And He has prepared for the disbelievers) i.e., among their nations,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóĞóÇÈÇğ ÃóáöíãÇğ</div><br>  (a painful torment.) i.e., agonizing. We bear witness that the Messengers did indeed convey the Message of their Lord and advised their nations, and that they clearly showed them the truth in which there is no confusion, doubt or ambiguity, even though they were rejected by the ignorant, stubborn and rebellious wrongdoers. What the Messengers brought is the truth, and whoever opposes them is misguided. As the people of Paradise will say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóÊú ÑõÓõáõ ÑóÈøöäóÇ ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth.)
