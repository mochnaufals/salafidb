If He wills, He sends them to you, and if He wills, He ignores your request.'' Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõÔúÚöÑõßõãú ÃóäøóåóÂ ÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊú áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó</div><br>  (And what will make you perceive that (even) if it came, they will not believe)  It was said that `you' in `make you preceive' refers to the idolators, according to Mujahid. In this case, the Ayah would mean, what makes you -- you idolators -- preceive that you are truthful in the vows that you swore Therefore, in this recitation, the Ayah means, the idolators will still not believe if the sign that they asked for came. It was also said that `you' in, `what will make you preceive', refers to the believers, meaning, what will make you preceive, O believers, that the idolators will still not believe if the signs come. Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ãóäóÚóßó ÃóáÇøó ÊóÓúÌõÏó ÅöĞú ÃóãóÑúÊõßó</div><br>  ("What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not prostrate, when I commanded you'') 7:12 and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍóÑóÇãñ Úóáóì ŞóÑúíóÉò ÃóåúáóßúäóÜåóÂ Ãóäøóåõãú áÇó íóÑúÌöÚõæäó </div><br>  (And a ban is laid on every town (population) which We have destroyed that they shall not return (to this world again).) 21:95 These Ayat mean: `What made you, O Iblis, refrain from prostrating, although I commanded you to do so, and, in the second Ayah, that village shall not return to this world again. In the Ayah above 6:109, the meaning thus becomes: What makes you perceive, O believers, who wish eagerly for the disbelievers to believe, that if the Ayat came to them they would believe Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõŞóáøöÈõ ÃóİúÆöÏóÊóåõãú æóÃóÈúÕóÜÑóåõãú ßóãóÇ áóãú íõÄúãöäõæÇú Èöåö Ãóæøóáó ãóÑøóÉò</div><br>  (And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away, as they refused to believe therein for the first time,) Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah, "When the idolators rejected what Allah sent down, their hearts did not settle on any one thing and they turned away from every matter (of benefit).'' Mujahid said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõŞóáøöÈõ ÃóİúÆöÏóÊóåõãú æóÃóÈúÕóÜÑóåõãú</div><br>  (and We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away, ) means, We prevent them from the faith, and even if every sign came to them, they will not believe, just as We prevented them from faith the first time. Similar was said by `Ikrimah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said, "Allah mentions what the servants will say before they say it and what they will do before they do it. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõäóÈøöÆõßó ãöËúáõ ÎóÈöíÑò</div><br>  (And none can inform you like Him Who is the All-Knower.) 35:14 and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä ÊóŞõæáó äóİúÓñ íÍóÓúÑóÊóì Úóáóì ãóÇ İóÑøóØóÊõ İöì ÌóäÈö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Lest a person should say, "Alas, my grief that I was undutiful to Allah.'') 39:56 until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú Ãóäøó áöì ßóÜÑøóÉğ İóÃóßõæäó ãöäó ÇáúãõÍúÓöäöíäó</div><br>  ("If only I had another chance, then I should indeed be among the doers of good.'') 39:58. So Allah, glory be to Him, states that if they were sent back to life, they would not accept the guidance,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÑõÏøõæÇú áóÚóÜÏõæÇú áöãóÇ äõåõæÇú Úóäúåõ æóÅöäøóåõãú áóßóÜĞöÈõæäó</div><br>  (But if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.) 6:28 Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõŞóáøöÈõ ÃóİúÆöÏóÊóåõãú æóÃóÈúÕóÜÑóåõãú ßóãóÇ áóãú íõÄúãöäõæÇú Èöåö Ãóæøóáó ãóÑøóÉò</div><br>  (And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance), as they refused to believe therein for the first time,) meaning: `If they were sent back to this life, they would be prevented from embracing the guidance, just as We prevented them from it the first time, when they were in the life of this world.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóĞóÑõåõãú</div><br>  (and We shall leave them...) and abandon them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöí ØõÛúíóÜäöåöãú</div><br>  (in their trespass...) meaning, disbelief, according to Ibn `Abbas and As-Suddi. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Qatadah said that `their trespass' means, `their misguidance'. m   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚúãóåõæäó</div><br>  (to wander blindly) or playfully, according to Al-A`mash. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi`, Abu Malik and others commented, "to wander in their disbelief.''  </div></body></html>
