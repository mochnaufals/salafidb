Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas about   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö æóÑõÓõáöåö ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáÕøöÏøöíŞõæäó</div><br>  (And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers -- they are the Siddiqun) that its meaning does not continue to the next Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÔøõåóÏóÂÁõ ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú áóåõãú ÃóÌúÑõåõãú æóäõæÑõåõãú</div><br>  (and the martyrs (are) with their Lord.

Abu Ad-Duha (stopped after he) recited,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáÕøöÏøöíŞõæäó</div><br>  (they are the Siddiqun), then initiated recitation:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÔøõåóÏóÂÁõ ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  (and the martyrs (are) with their Lord.) Masruq, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan and others said similarly. Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Ad-Duha from Masruq from `Abdullah bin Mas`ud commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáÕøöÏøöíŞõæäó æóÇáÔøõåóÏóÂÁõ ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  (they are the Siddiqun, and the martyrs with their Lord.) "They are of three categories,'' meaning there are those who spend in charity, the Siddiqun and the martyrs. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõØöÚö Çááøóåó æóÇáÑøóÓõæáó İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó ãóÚó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóäúÚóãó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöã ãøöäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó æóÇáÕøöÏøöíŞöíäó æóÇáÔøõåóÏóÂÁö æóÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó</div><br>  (And whoso obey Allah and the Messenger, then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, of the Prophets, the Siddiqin, the martyrs, and the righteous.)(4:69) Therefore, Allah made a distinction between the Siddiqin and the martyrs, indicating that they are of two distinct categories, so there is no doubt that Siddiq is a better status than the martyr. Imam Malik bin Anas recorded in his Muwatta' that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Ãóåúáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö áóíóÊóÑóÇÁóæúäó Ãóåúáó ÇáúÛõÑóİö ãöäú İóæúŞöåöãú¡ ßóãóÇ ÊóÊóÑóÇÁóæúäó ÇáúßóæúßóÈó ÇáÏøõÑøöíøó ÇáúÛóÇÈöÑó İöí ÇáúÃõİõŞö ãöäó ÇáúãóÔúÑöŞö Ãóæö ÇáúãóÛúÑöÈö¡ áöÊóİóÇÖõáö ãóÇ Èóíúäóåõã»</div><br>  (The people of Paradise will look at the dwellers of the lofty mansions as one looks at a brilliant star far away in the east or in the west on the horizon, because of their superiority over one another.) On that the people said, "O Allah's Messenger! Are these lofty mansions for the Prophets whom none else can reach'' The Prophet replied,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Èóáóì¡ æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö¡ ÑöÌóÇáñ ÂãóäõæÇ ÈöÇááåö æóÕóÏøóŞõæÇ ÇáúãõÑúÓóáöíä»</div><br>  (No! By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! these are for men who believe in Allah and believe in the Messengers.) Al-Bukhari and Muslim also collected this Hadith. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÔøõåóÏóÂÁõ ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú</div><br>  (and the martyrs with their Lord.) means that they will be in the gardens of Paradise, as recorded in the Sahih:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÃóÑúæóÇÍó ÇáÔøõåóÏóÇÁö İöí ÍóæóÇÕöáö ØóíúÑò ÎõÖúÑò ÊóÓúÑóÍõ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÍóíúËõ ÔóÇÁóÊú¡ Ëõãøó ÊóÃúæöí Åöáóì Êöáúßó ÇáúŞóäóÇÏöíáö İóÇØøóáóÚó Úóáóíúåöãú ÑóÈøõßó ÇØøöáóÇÚóÉğ İóŞóÇáó: ãóÇĞóÇ ÊõÑöíÏõæäó¿ İóŞóÇáõæÇ: äõÍöÈøõ Ãóäú ÊóÑõÏøóäóÇ Åöáóì ÇáÏøóÇÑö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ İóäõŞóÇÊöáó İöíßó İóäõŞúÊóáó¡ ßóãóÇ ŞõÊöáúäóÇ Ãóæøóáó ãóÑøóÉò¡ İóŞóÇáó: Åöäøöí ŞóÏú ŞóÖóíúÊõ Ãóäøóåõãú ÅöáóíúåóÇ áóÇ íóÑúÌöÚõæä»</div><br>  (The souls of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds, who fly wherever they wish in Paradise and then return to their nests in chandeliers. Once your Lord cast a glance at them and said, `Do you want anything'' They said, "We wish that You return us to the life of the world, so that we may fight in Your cause and be killed as we were killed the first time.'' Allah said, "I have decreed that they shall not be returned to it again.'') Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõãú ÃóÌúÑõåõãú æóäõæÑõåõãú</div><br>  (They shall have their reward and their light.), means that Allah will grant them a generous reward and a tremendous light that will precede before them. In this, the believers vary regarding the level of reward they receive, according to their good actions in the life of this world. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÔøõåóÏóÇÁõ ÃóÑúÈóÚóÉñ: ÑóÌõáñ ãõÄúãöäñ ÌóíøöÏõ ÇáúÅöíãóÇäö¡ áóŞöíó ÇáúÚóÏõæøó İóÕóÏóŞó Çááåó İóŞõÊöáó¡ İóĞóÇßó ÇáøóĞöí íóäúÙõÑõ ÇáäøóÇÓõ Åöáóíúåö åßóĞóÇ»</div><br>  (There are four ranks of martyrs. The first is a man who believes and who is true in faith, who meets the enemy (in battle), fulfills his duty to Allah and is killed. This is the type that the people will look up to (his level in Paradise), like this.) The Prophet raised his head until his cap fell off his head, and the same happened to `Umar. The Prophet continued,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáËøóÇäöí ãõÄúãöäñ áóŞöíó ÇáúÚóÏõæøó İóßóÃóäøóãóÇ íõÖúÑóÈõ ÙóåúÑõåõ ÈöÔóæúßö ÇáØøóáúÍö¡ ÌóÇÁóåõ Óóåúãñ ÛóÑúÈñ İóŞóÊóáóåõ¡ İóĞóÇßó İöí ÇáÏøóÑóÌóÉö ÇáËøóÇäöíóÉö. æóÇáËøóÇáöËõ ÑóÌõáñ ãõÄúãöäñ ÎóáóØó ÚóãóáğÇ ÕóÇáöÍğÇ æóÂÎóÑó ÓóíøöÆğÇ¡ áóŞöíó ÇáúÚóÏõæøó İóÕóÏóŞó Çááåó ÍóÊúì ŞõÊöáó¡ İóĞóÇßó İöí ÇáÏøóÑóÌóÉö ÇáËøóÇáöËóÉö. æóÇáÑøóÇÈöÚõ ÑóÌõáñ ãõÄúãöäñ ÃóÓúÑóİó Úóáóì äóİúÓöåö ÅöÓúÑóÇİğÇ ßóËöíÑğÇ¡ áóŞöíó ÇáúÚóÏõæøó İóÕóÏóŞó Çááåó ÍóÊúì ŞõÊöáó¡ İóĞóÇßó İöí ÇáÏøóÑóÌóÉö ÇáÑøóÇÈöÚóÉ»</div><br>  (The second is a believer who meets the enemy and is struck by a stray arrow which causes him to die. This believer is in the second grade. The third is a believer who has combined good deeds with evil deeds; he meets the enemy and is truthful to his duty to Allah until he is killed. This is the third category. And the fourth is a believer who has committed sins excessively, so he meets the enemy and is truthful to his duty to Allah, and is killed. This is the fourth category.) `Ali bin Al-Madini also reported this Hadith and said, "This Egyptian chain is Salih useful.'' At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Gharib.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóßóĞøóÈõæÇú ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊöäóÂ ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóÍöíãö </div><br>  (But those who disbelieve and deny Our Ayat -- they shall be the dwellers of the blazing Fire.) mentions the destination and the condition of the miserable ones, after Allah mentioned the destination and rewards of the happy ones.  </div></body></html>
