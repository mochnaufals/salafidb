Allah has complete knowledge of what has not occured, and how it would be if and when it did occur.

And how excellent these companions are!) Consequently, whosoever implements what Allah and His Messenger have commanded him and avoids what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited, then Allah will grant him a dwelling in the Residence of Honor. There, Allah will place him in the company of the Prophets, and those who are lesser in grade, the true believers, then the martyrs and then the righteous, who are righteous inwardly and outwardly. Allah then praised this company,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍóÓõäó ÃõæáóÜÆößó ÑóİöíŞÇğ</div><br>  (And how excellent these companions are!) Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú äóÈöíó íóãúÑóÖõ ÅöáøóÇ ÎõíøöÑó Èóíúäó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÇáúÂÎöÑóÉ»</div><br>  (Every Prophet who falls ill is given the choice between this life and the Hereafter.)

Muslim recorded this Hadith.  This Hadith explains the meaning of another Hadith; the Prophet said before his death;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó (İöí) ÇáÑøóİöíŞö ÇáúÃóÚúáóì»</div><br>  (O Allah! In the Most High Company) three times, and he then died, may Allah's best blessings be upon him. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reason Behind Revealing this Honorable Ayah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ibn Jarir recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "An Ansari man came to the Messenger of Allah while feeling sad. The Prophet said to him, `Why do I see you sad' He said, `O Allah's Prophet! I was contemplating about something.' The Prophet said, `What is it' The Ansari said, `We come to you day and night, looking at your face and sitting by you. Tomorrow, you will be raised with the Prophets, and we will not be able to see you.' The Prophet did not say anything, but later Jibril came down to him with this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõØöÚö Çááøóåó æóÇáÑøóÓõæáó İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó ãóÚó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóäúÚóãó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöã ãøöäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó</div><br>  (And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, of the Prophets), and the Prophet sent the good news to the Ansari man.'' This Hadith was narrated in Mursal form from Masruq, `Ikrimah, `Amir Ash-Sha`bi, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. This is the version with the best chain of narrators. Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah recorded it with a different chain from `A'ishah, who said; "A man came to the Prophet and said to him, `O Messenger of Allah! You are more beloved to me than myself, my family and children. Sometimes, when I am at home, I remember you, and I cannot wait until I come and look at you. When I contemplate about my death and your death, I know that you will be with the Prophets when you enter Paradise. I fear that I might not see you when I enter Paradise.' The Prophet did not answer him until the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõØöÚö Çááøóåó æóÇáÑøóÓõæáó İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó ãóÚó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóäúÚóãó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöã ãøöäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó æóÇáÕøöÏøöíŞöíäó æóÇáÔøõåóÏóÂÁö æóÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó æóÍóÓõäó ÃõæáóÜÆößó ÑóİöíŞÇğ </div><br>  (And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, of the Prophets, the true believers, the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!) was revealed to him.'' This was collected by Al-Hafiz Abu `Abdullah Al-Maqdisi in his book, Sifat Al-Jannah, he then commented, "I do not see problems with this chain.'' And Allah knows best. Muslim recorded that Rabi`ah bin Ka`b Al-Aslami said, "I used to sleep at the Prophet's house and bring him his water for ablution and his needs. He once said to me, `Ask me.' I said, `O Messenger of Allah! I ask that I be your companion in Paradise.' He said, `Anything except that' I said, `Only that.' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóÃóÚöäøöí Úóáì äóİúÓößó ÈößóËúÑóÉö ÇáÓøõÌõæÏ»</div><br>  (Then help me (fulfill this wish) for you by performing many prostrations.)''  Imam Ahmad recorded that `Amr bin Murrah Al-Juhani said, "A man came to the Prophet and said, `O Allah's Messenger! I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah, pray the five (daily prayers), give the Zakah due on my wealth and fast the month of Ramadan.' The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÜÜÜäú ãóÜÜÜÇÊó Úóáì åóÜÜÜĞóÇ ßóÇäó ãóÜÜÜÚó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíÜÜäó æóÇáÕøöÜÜÏøöíŞöíäó æóÇáÔøõÜÜåóÏóÇÁö íóÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜÜÜÜÜÇãóÉö¡åóßóĞÇ æóäóÕóÈó ÃõÕúÈõÚóíúåö ãóÇ áóãú íóÚõŞøó æóÇáöÏóíúå»</div><br>  (Whoever dies in this state will be with the Prophets, the truthful and martyrs on the Day of Resurrection, as long as - and he raised his finger - he is not disobedient to his parents.)'' Only Ahmad recorded this Hadith. Greater news than this is in the authentic Hadith collected in the Sahih and Musnad compilations, in Mutawatir form, narrated by several Companions that the Messenger of Allah was asked about the person who loves a people, but his status is not close to theirs. The Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúãóÑúÁõ ãóÚó ãóäú ÃóÍóÈ»</div><br>  (One is with those whom he loves.) Anas commented, "Muslims were never happier than with this Hadith.'' In another narration, Anas said, "I love the Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr and `Umar, and I hope that Allah will resurrect me with them, even though I did not perform actions similar to theirs.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó ÇáúİóÖúáõ ãöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Such is the bounty from Allah) meaning, from Allah by His mercy, for it is He who made them suitable for this, not their good deeds.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóİóì ÈöÇááøóåö ÚóáöíãÇğ</div><br>  (and Allah is sufficient as All-Knower), He knows those who deserve guidance and success.  </div></body></html>
