Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) mentioned his dream to his father, Prophet Ya`qub (Jacob), son of Prophet Ishaq (Isaac), son of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), peace be upon them all. `Abdullah bin `Abbas stated that the dreams of Prophets are revelations from Allah. Scholars of Tafsir explained that in Yusuf's dream the eleven stars represent his brothers, who were eleven, and the sun and the moon represent his father and mother. This explanation was collected from Ibn `Abbas, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Sufyan Ath-Thawri and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Yusuf's vision became a reality forty years later, or as some say, eighty years, when Yusuf raised his parents to the throne while his brothers were before him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÎóÑøõæÇú áóåõ ÓõÌøóÏóÇ æóŞóÇáó íÃóÈóÊö åóÜĞóÇ ÊóÃúæöíáõ ÑõÄúíóÜì ãöä ŞóÈúáõ ŞóÏú ÌóÚóáóåóÇ ÑóÈøöì ÍóŞøğÇ</div><br>  (and they fell down before him prostrate.
