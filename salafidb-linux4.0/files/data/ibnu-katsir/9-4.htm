They would have four months to travel the lands in search of sanctuary for themselves wherever they wish. Those whose treaty mentioned a specifec limited term, then the longest it would extend was to the point of its agreed upon termination date. Hadiths in this regard preceeded. So anyone who had a treaty with Allah's Messenger , it lasted until its specific termination date. However, those in this category were required to refrain from breaking the terms of the agreement with Muslims and from helping non-Muslims against Muslims. This is the type whose peace agreement with Muslims was carried out to its end. Allah encouraged honoring such peace treaties, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúãõÊøóŞöíäó</div><br>  (Surely, Allah loves those who have Taqwa) 9:4, who keep their promises.  </div></body></html>
