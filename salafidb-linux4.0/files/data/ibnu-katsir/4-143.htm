Here, Allah states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó íõÎóÜÏöÚõæäó Çááøóåó æóåõæó ÎóÇÏöÚõåõãú</div><br>  (Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them.) There is no doubt that Allah can never be deceived, for He has perfect knowledge of the secrets and what the hearts conceal. However, the hypocrites, due to their ignorance, scarce knowledge and weak minds, think that since they were successful in deceiving people, using Islamic Law as a cover of safety for themselves, they will acquire the same status with Allah on the Day of Resurrection and deceive Him too. Allah states that on that Day, the hypocrites will swear to Him that they were on the path of righteousness and correctness thinking that such statement will benefit them with Allah. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÈúÚóËõåõãõ Çááøóåö ÌóãöíÚÇğ İóíóÍúáöİõæäó áóåõ ßóãóÇ íóÍúáöİõæäó áóßõãú</div><br>  (On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÎóÇÏöÚõåõãú</div><br>  (but it is He Who deceives them) means, He lures them further into injustice and misguidance. He also prevents them from reaching the truth in this life and on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóŞõæáõ ÇáúãõäóÜİöŞõæäó æóÇáúãõäóÜİöŞóÜÊõ áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÇäÙõÑõæäóÇ äóŞúÊóÈöÓú ãöä äøõæÑößõãú</div><br>  (On the Day when the hypocrites Ü men and women Ü will say to the believers: "Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!'' It will be said: "Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!'') until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈöÆúÓó ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ</div><br>  (And worst indeed is that destination). A Hadith states;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóä ÓóãøóÚó ÓóãøóÚó Çááåõ Èöåö¡ æóãóäú ÑóÇÁóì ÑóÇÁóì Çááåõ Èöå»</div><br>  (Whoever wants to be heard of, Allah will make him heard of, and whoever wants to be seen, Allah will show him.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ŞóÇãõæÇú Åöáóì ÇáÕøóáóæÉö ŞóÇãõæÇú ßõÓóÇáóì</div><br>  (And when they stand up for Salah, they stand with laziness). This is the characteristic of the hypocrites with the most honored, best and righteous act of worship, the prayer. When they stand for prayer, they stand in laziness because they neither truly intend to perform it nor do they believe in it, have humility in it, or understand it. This is the description of their outward attitude! As for their hearts, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÑóÂÁõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓó</div><br>  (to be seen of men) meaning, they do not have sincerity when worshipping Allah. Rather, they show off to people so that they gain closeness to them. They are often absent from the prayers that they can hide away from, such as the `Isha' prayer and the Dawn prayer that are prayed in darkness. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóËúŞóáõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö Úóáóì ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞöíäó ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúÚöÔóÇÁö æóÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúİóÌúÑö¡ æóáóæú íóÚúáóãõæäó ãóÇ İöíåöãóÇ áóÃóÊóæúåõãóÇ æóáóæú ÍóÈúæğÇ¡ æóáóŞóÏú åóãóãúÊõ Ãóäú ÂãõÑó ÈöÇáÕøóáóÇÉö İóÊõŞóÇãõ¡ Ëõãøó ÂãõÑó ÑóÌõáğÇ İóíõÕóáøöí ÈöÇáäøóÇÓö¡ Ëõãøó ÃóäúØóáöŞó ãóÚöíó ÈöÑöÌóÇáò ãóÚóåõãú ÍõÒóãñ ãöäú ÍóØóÈò¡ Åöáì Şóæúãò áóÇ íóÔúåóÏõæäó ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó¡ İóÃõÍóÑøöŞó Úóáóíúåöãú ÈõíõæÊóåõãú ÈöÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  . (The heaviest prayers on the hypocrites are the `Isha' and Dawn prayers. If they know their rewards, they will attend them even if they have to crawl. I was about to order someone to pronounce the Adhan for the prayer, then order someone to lead the prayer for the people, then order some men to collect fire-wood (fuel); then I would burn the houses around men who did not attend the (compulsory congregational) prayer.) In another narration, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö¡ áóæú Úóáöãó ÃóÍóÏõåõãú Ãóäøóåõ íóÌöÏõ ÚóÑúŞğÇ ÓóãöíäğÇ Ãóæú ãöÑúãóÇÊóíúäö ÍóÓóäóÊóíúäö¡ áóÔóåöÏó ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó¡ æóáóæúáóÇ ãóÇ İöí ÇáúÈõíõæÊö ãöäó ÇáäøöÓóÇÁö æóÇáĞøõÑøöíøóÜÉö áóÍóÑøóŞúÊõ Úóáóíúåöãú ÈõíõæÊóåõãú ÈöÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (By Him, in Whose Hand my soul is, if anyone of them had known that he would get a bone covered with good meat or two (small) pieces of meat between two ribs, he would have turned up for the prayer, and had it not been that the houses have women and children in them, I would burn their homes around them.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóĞúßõÑõæäó Çááøóåó ÅöáÇøó ŞóáöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And they do not remember Allah but little) means, during the prayer they do not feel humbleness or pay attention to what they are reciting. Rather, during their prayer, they are inattentive, jesting and avoid the good that they are meant to receive from prayer. Imam Malik reported that Al-`Ala' bin `Abdur-Rahman said that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Êöáúßó ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞö¡ Êöáúßó ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞö¡ Êöáúßó ÕóáóÇÉõ ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞö¡ íóÌúáöÓõ íóÑúŞõÈõ ÇáÔøóãúÓó¡ ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ ßóÇäóÊú Èóíúäó ŞóÑúäóíö ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäö¡ ŞóÇãó İóäóŞóÑó ÃóÑúÈóÚğÇ¡ áóÇ íóĞúßõÑõ Çááåó İöíåóÇ ÅöáøóÇ ŞóáöíáğÇ»</div><br>  (This is the prayer of the hypocrite, this is the prayer of the hypocrite, this is the prayer of the hypocrite. He sits watching the sun until when it goes down between the two horns of the devil, he stands up pecks out four Rak`ahs (for `Asr) without remembering Allah during them except little.) Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded it. At-Tirmidhi said "Hasan Sahih''.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõĞóÈúĞóÈöíäó Èóíúäó Ğáößó áÇó Åöáóì åóÜÄõáÇÁö</div><br>  ((They are) swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these) means that the hypocrites are swaying between faith and disbelief. So they are neither with believers inwardly or outwardly nor with disbelievers inwardly or outwardly. Rather, they are with the believers outwardly and with the disbelievers inwardly. Some of them would suffer fits of doubt, leaning towards these sometimes and towards those sometimes,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøóãóÂ ÃóÖóÂÁó áóåõã ãøóÔóæúÇú İöíåö æóÅöĞóÂ ÃóÙúáóãó Úóáóíúåöãú ŞóÇãõæÇú</div><br>  (Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still). Mujahid said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõĞóÈúĞóÈöíäó Èóíúäó Ğáößó áÇó Åöáóì åóÜÄõáÇÁö</div><br>  ((They are) swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these) "The Companions of Muhammad ,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó Åöáóì åóÜÄõáÇÁö</div><br>  (nor to those): the Jews.'' Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóËóáõ ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞö ßóãóËóáö ÇáÔøóÇÉö ÇáúÚóÇÆöÑóÉö Èóíúäó ÇáúÛóäóãóíúäö¡ ÊóÚöíÑõ Åöáì åóĞöåö ãóÑøóÉğ¡ æóÅöáóì åóĞöåö ãóÑøóÉğ¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÏúÑöí ÃóíøóÊóåõãóÇ ÊóÊúÈóÚ»</div><br>  (The example of the hypocrite is the example of the sheep wandering between two herds, sometimes she goes to one of them, and sometimes the other, confused over whom she should follow.) Muslim also recorded it. This is why Allah said afterwards,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõÖúáöáö Çááøóåõ İóáóä ÊóÌöÏó áóåõ ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (and he whom Allah sends astray, you will not find for him a way.) meaning, whomever He leads astray from the guidance,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóä ÊóÌöÏó áóåõ æóáöíøğÇ ãøõÑúÔöÏğÇ</div><br>  (For him you will find no Wali (guiding friend) to lead him (to the right path)) because,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä íõÖúáöáö Çááøóåõ İóáÇó åóÇÏöíó áóåõ</div><br>  (Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him). So the hypocrites whom Allah has led astray from the paths of safety will never find a guide to direct them, nor someone to save them. There is none who can resist Allah's decision, and He is not asked about what He does, while they all will be asked.  </div></body></html>
