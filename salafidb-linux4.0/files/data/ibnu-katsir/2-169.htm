He also forbade them from following the footsteps of Shaytan, meaning his ways and methods with which he misguides his followers, like prohibiting the Bahirah (a she-camel whose milk was spared for the idols and nobody was allowed to milk it), or Sa'ibah (a she-camel let loose for free pasture for the idols and nothing was allowed to be carried on it), or a Wasilah (a she-camel set free for idols because it has given birth to a she-camel at its first delivery and then again gives birth to a she-camel at its second delivery), and all of the other things that Shaytan made attractive to them during the time of Jahiliyyah. Muslim recorded `Iyad bin Himar saying that Allah's Messenger said that Allah the Exalted says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáóì:Åöäøó ßõáøó ãóÇáò ãóäóÍúÊõåõ ÚöÈóÇÏöí İóåõæó áóåõãú ÍóáóÇáñ¡ æóİöíåö æóÅöäøöí ÎóáóŞúÊõ ÚöÈóÇÏöí ÍõäóİóÇÁó¡ İóÌóÇÁóÊúåõãõ ÇáÔøóíóÇØöíäõ İóÇÌúÊóÇáóÊúåõãú Úóäú Ïöíäöåöãú¡ æóÍóÑøóãóÊú Úóáóíúåöãú ãóÇ ÃóÍúáóáúÊõ áóåõã»</div><br>  (`Every type of wealth I have endowed My servants is allowed for them...' (until), `I have created My servants Hunafa' (pure or upright), but the devils came to them and led them astray from their (true) religion and prohibited them from what I allowed for them.

(18:50)  Qatadah and As-Suddi commented on what Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÊøóÈöÚõæÇú ÎõØõæóÊö ÇáÔøóíúØóÜäö</div><br>  (...and follow not the footsteps of Shaytan (Satan)):  Every act of disobedience to Allah is among the footsteps of Satan.  `Abd bin Humayd reported that Ibn `Abbas said: "Any vow or oath that one makes while angry, is among the footsteps of Shaytan and its expiation is that of the vow. '' Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ íóÃúãõÑõßõã ÈöÇáÓøõæÁö æóÇáúİóÍúÔóÂÁö æóÃóä ÊóŞõæáõæÇú Úóáóì Çááøóåö ãóÇ áÇó ÊóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (He (Satan) commands you only what is evil and Fahsha (sinful), and that you should say about Allah what you know not.)  The verse means: `Your enemy, Satan, commands you to commit evil acts and what is worse than that, such as adultery and so forth. He commands you to commit what is even worse, that is, saying about Allah without knowledge.' So this includes every innovator and disbeliever.  </div></body></html>
