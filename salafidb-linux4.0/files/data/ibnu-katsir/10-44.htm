Similarly, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó - áÇó ÃóÚúÈõÏõ ãóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó </div><br>  (Say: "O you disbelievers! I worship not that which you worship.'')109:1-2 to the end of the Surah. Ibrahim Al-Khalil (the Friend) and his followers said to the idolators among their people:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÈõÑóÁÂÄÇú ãøöäúßõãú æóãöãøóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allah) 60:4  Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäúåõãú ãøóä íóÓúÊóãöÚõæäó Åöáóíúßó</div><br>  (And among them are some who listen to you,) They listen to your beautiful talk and to the Glorious Qur'an. They listen to your truthful, eloquent and authentic Hadiths that are useful to the hearts, the bodies and their faith. This is indeed a great benefit and is sufficient. But guiding the people to the truth is not up to you or to them. You cannot make the deaf hear. Therefore you cannot guide these people except if Allah wishes. Y   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäåõãú ãøóä íóäÙõÑõ Åöáóíúßó</div><br>  (And among them are some who look at you, ) They look at you and at what Allah has given you in terms of dignity, noble personality and great conduct. There is in all of this clear evidence of your prophethood to those who have reason and insight. Other people also look but they do not receive guidance like them. Believers look at you with respect and dignity while disbelievers regard you with contempt.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóæúßó Åöä íóÊøóÎöĞõæäóßó ÅöáÇøó åõÒõæÇğ</div><br>  (And when they see you, they treat you only in mockery.)25:41 Then Allah announces that He is never unjust with anyone. He guides whomever He wills and opens the eyes of the blind, makes the deaf hear and removes neglect from the hearts. At the same time He lets others go astray, moving away from faith. He does all of that yet He is always Just, for He is the Ruler and has full authority over His kingdom. He does whatever He wills without any restrictions. No one can question Him as to what He does while he will question everyone else. He is Omniscient, All-Wise, and All-Just. So Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íóÙúáöãõ ÇáäøóÇÓó ÔóíúÆğÇ æóáóÜßöäøó ÇáäøóÇÓó ÃóäİõÓóåõãú íóÙúáöãõæäó </div><br>  (Truly, Allah wrongs not mankind in aught; but mankind wrong themselves.) In the Hadith narrated by Abu Dharr, he states that the Prophet related that His Lord, Exalted and High is He, said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÚöÈóÇÏöí Åöäøöí ÍóÑøóãúÊõ ÇáÙøõáúãó Úóáóì äóİúÓöí æóÌóÚóáúÊõåõ Èóíúäóßõãú ãõÍóÑøóãğÇ İóáóÇ ÊóÙóÇáóãõæÇ»</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>(O My servant! I have prohibited oppression for Myself and made it prohibited for you, so do not oppress one another...) Until He said at the end of the Hadith: íóÇ ÚöÈóÇÏöí ÅöäøóãóÇ åöíó ÃóÚúãóÇáõßõãú ÃõÍúÕöíåóÇ áóßõãú¡ Ëõãøó Ãõæİöíßõãú ÅöíøóÇåóÇ¡ İóãóäú æóÌóÏó ÎóíúÑğÇ İóáúíóÍúãóÏö Çááåó¡ æóãóäú æóÌóÏó ÛóíúÑó Ğóáößó İóáóÇ íóáõæãóäøó ÅöáøóÇ äóİúÓóå»</div><br>  (O My servants! It is but your deeds that I reckon for you and then recompense you for. So let him who finds good (in the Hereafter) praise Allah. And let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself.) The complete version was recorded by Muslim.  </div></body></html>
