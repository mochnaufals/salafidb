The disbelievers used to call the Prophet , before he received revelation, `Al-Amin' -- the Truthful. The leader of the Quraysh disbelievers, Abu Sufyan, had to admit to this fact when Heraclius, emperor of Rome, asked him, "How honorable is his (the Prophet's) ancestral lineage among you'' Abu Sufyan answered, "His ancestry is highly regarded among us.'' Heraclius asked, "Do you find that he lied, before he started his mission'' Abu Sufyan replied, "No.'' The emperor of Rome relied on the honor and purity of the Prophet to recognize the truth of his prophethood and what he came with. Imam Ahmad recorded that Wathilah bin Al-Asqa` said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÇÕúØóİóì ãöäú æóáóÏö ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãó ÅöÓúãóÇÚöíáó¡ æóÇÕúØóİóì ãöäú Èóäöí ÅöÓúãóÇÚöíáó Èóäöí ßöäóÇäóÉó æóÇÕúØóİóì ãöäú Èóäöí ßöäóÇäóÉó ŞõÑóíúÔğÇ æóÇÕúØóİóì ãöäúäõŞÑóíúÔò Èóäöí åóÇÔöãò æóÇÕúØóİóÇäöí ãöäú Èóäöí åóÇÔöã»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah has chosen Isma`il from the offspring of Ibrahim, Bani Kinanah from the offspring of Isma`il, Quraysh from Bani Kinanah, Bani Hashim from Quraysh and, He has chosen me from Bani Hashim.) Muslim recorded this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈõÚöËúÊõ ãöäú ÎóíúÑö ŞõÑõæäö Èóäöí ÂÏóãó ŞóÑúäğÇ İóŞóÑúäğÇ¡ ÍóÊøóì ÈõÚöËúÊõ ãöäó ÇáúŞóÑúäö ÇáøóĞöí ßõäúÊõ İöíå»</div><br>  (I was chosen from a succession of the best generations of the Children of Adam, until the generation I was sent in.)

This is a stern threat and sure promise from Allah for those who arrogantly refrain from obeying His Messengers and adhering to what they came with. On the Day of Resurrection, they will suffer humiliation and eternal disgrace before Allah, because they were arrogant in the worldly life. This is why it is befitting that they earn disgrace on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÓúÊóßúÈöÑõæäó Úóäú ÚöÈóÇÏóÊöì ÓóíóÏúÎõáõæäó Ìóåóäøóãó ÏóÎöÑöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) 40:60 disgrace and dishonor. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóĞóÇÈñ ÔóÏöíÏñ ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóãúßõÑõæäó</div><br>  (and a severe torment for that which they used to plot.) Since plotting usually takes place in secret and involves treachery and deceit, the disbelievers were recompensed with severe torment from Allah on the Day of Resurrection, as a just reckoning,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÙúáöãõ ÑóÈøõßó ÃóÍóÏğÇ</div><br>  (And your Lord treats no one with injustice) 18:49 Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊõÈúáóì ÇáÓøóÑóÂÆöÑõ </div><br>  (The Day when all the secrets will be examined. ) 86:9 Meaning, the secrets, hidden thoughts and intentions will be exposed. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõäúÕóÈõ áößõáøö ÛóÇÏöÑò áöæóÇÁñ ÚöäúÏó ÇÓúÊöåö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ İóíõŞóÇáõ: åóĞöåö ÛóÏúÑóÉõ İõáóÇäö Èúäö İõáóÇäö Èúäö İõáóÇä»</div><br>  (A banner will be raised for every deceitful person from his anus on the Day of Resurrection, and it will say; `This is the treacherous plot of so-and-so, son of so-and-so, son of so-and-so.,) The wisdom in this is that since a plot occurs in secret, and people are usually unaware of it, then on the Day of Resurrection the plot itself will become public news testifying to the actions of those who committed it.  </div></body></html>
