Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊóÛöíÖõ ÇáÇøñÑúÍóÇãõ</div><br>  (and by how much the wombs fall short), this refers to miscarriages,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊóÒúÏóÇÏõ</div><br>  (or exceed), this refers to carrying her fetus in her womb for the full term. Some women carry their fetus for ten months, while others for nine months. Some terms are longer or shorter than others. This is the falling short or exceeding that Allah the Exalted mentioned, and all this occurs by His knowledge.''  Qatadah commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõáøõ ÔóìúÁò ÚöäÏóåõ ÈöãöŞúÏóÇÑò</div><br>  (Everything with Him is in proportion.) "For a term appointed. Allah has the records of the provisions and terms of His creation and made an appointed term for everything.'' An authentic Hadith mentioned that one of the Prophet's daughters sent (a messenger) to him requesting him to come as her child was dying, but the Prophet returned the messenger and told him to say to her,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ááåö ãóÇ ÃóÎóĞó¡ æóáóåõ ãóÇ ÃóÚúØóì¡ æóßõáøõ ÔóíúÁò ÚöäúÏóåõ ÈöÃóÌóáò ãõÓóãøğì¡ İóãõÑõæåóÇ İóáúÊóÕúÈöÑú æóáúÊóÍúÊóÓöÈ»</div><br>  (Verily, whatever Allah takes is for Him and whatever He gives is for Him, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this world), and so she should be patient and hope for Allah's reward.)
