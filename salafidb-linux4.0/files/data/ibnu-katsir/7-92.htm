So the earthquake seized them and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes.) (92. Those who belied Shu`ayb, became as if they had never dwelt there (in their homes). Those who belied Shu`ayb, they were the losers.)  Allah describes the enormity of disbelief, rebellion, transgression and misguidance (of Shu`ayb's people) and the defiance of truth encrypted in their hearts.

Allah mentioned their end again in Suah Hud,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁó ÃóãúÑõäóÇ äóÌøóíúäóÇ ÔõÚóíúÈğÇ æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ãóÚóåõ ÈöÑóÍúãóÉò ãøöäøóÇ æóÃóÎóĞóÊö ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú ÇáÕøóíúÍóÉõ İóÃóÕúÈóÍõæÇú İöì ÏöíóÜÑöåöãú ÌóÜËöãöíäó </div><br>  (And when Our commandment came, We saved Shu`ayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And the Sayhah (loud cry) seized the wrongdoers, and they lay (dead) prostrate in their homes.) 11:94 This Ayah mentions the Sayhah (cry) that struck them after they mocked Shu`ayb, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÕóáóæóÊõßó ÊóÃúãõÑõßó</div><br>  (Does your Salah (prayer) command you...) so it was befitting to mention here the cry that made them silence. In Surat Ash-Shu`ara', Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóĞøóÈõæåõ İóÃóÎóĞóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈõ íóæúãö ÇáÙøõáøóÉö Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÚóĞóÇÈó íóæúãò ÚóÙöíãò </div><br>  (But they belied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them.

Therefore, Allah stated that each of these forms of punishment struck them on the Day of the Shadow. First,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÎóĞóåõãú ÚóĞóÇÈõ íóæúãö ÇáÙøõáøóÉö</div><br>  (So the torment of the Day of Shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them) 26:189 when a gloomy cloud came over them (containing) fire, flames and a tremendous light. Next, a cry from the sky descended on them and a tremor shook them from beneath. Consequently, their souls were captured, their lives were taken and their bodies became idle,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÕúÈóÍõæÇú İöí ÏóÇÑöåöãú ÌóÜËöãöíäó</div><br>  (and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes). Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÃóä áøóãú íóÛúäóæúÇú İöíåóÂ</div><br>  (They became as if they had never dwelt there) meaning, after the torment seized them, it looked as if they never dwelled in the land from which they wanted to expel their Messenger Shu`ayb and his followers. Here, Allah refuted their earlier statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóĞøóÈõæÇú ÔõÚóíúÈğÇ ßóÇäõæÇú åõãõ ÇáúÎóÜÓöÑöíäó</div><br>  (Those who belied Shu`ayb, they were the losers.)  </div></body></html>
