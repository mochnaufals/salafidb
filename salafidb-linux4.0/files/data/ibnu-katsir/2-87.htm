And indeed, We gave Musa the Book and followed him up with a succession of Messengers. And We gave `Isa, the son of Maryam, clear signs and supported him with Ruh-il-Qudus.

Allah mentioned that He gave Musa the Book, the Tawrah, and that the Jews changed, distorted, and defied its commands, as well as altered its meanings.  Allah sent Messengers and Prophets after Musa who followed his law, as Allah stated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ ÃóäÒóáúäóÇ ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉó İöíåóÇ åõÏğì æóäõæÑñ</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóÓúáóãõæÇú áöáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú æóÇáÑøóÈøóÇäöíøõæäó æóÇáÇøñÍúÈóÇÑõ ÈöãóÇ ÇÓúÊõÍúİöÙõæÇú ãöä ßöÊóÜÈö Çááøóåö æóßóÇäõæÇú Úóáóíúåö ÔõåóÏóÂÁó</div><br>  (Verily, We did reveal the Tawrah (to Musa), therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah's will, judged for the Jews. And the rabbis and the priests (too judged for the Jews by the Tawrah after those Prophets), for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and they were witnesses thereto) (5:44). This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóİøóíúäóÇ ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåö ÈöÇáÑøõÓõáö</div><br>  (And Qaffayna him with Messengers).  As-Suddi said that Abu Malik said that Qaffayna means, "Succeeded'', while others said, "Followed". Both meanings are plausible, since Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ÑõÓõáóäóÇ ÊóÊúÑóì</div><br>  (Then We sent Our Messengers in succession) (23:44).  Thereafter, Allah sent the last Prophet among the Children of Israel, `Isa the son of Mary, who was sent with some laws that differed with some in the Tawrah. This is why Allah also sent miracles to support `Isa. These included bringing the dead back to life, forming the shape of birds from clay and blowing into them, afterwhich they became living birds by Allah's leave, healing the sick and foretelling the Unseen, as Ibn `Abbas stated. Allah also aided him with Ruh Al-Qudus, and that refers to Jibril. All of these signs testified to the truthfulness of `Isa and what he was sent with. Yet, the Children of Israel became more defiant and envious of him and did not want to differ with even one part of the Tawrah, as Allah said about `Isa,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇøñÍöáøó áóßõã ÈóÚúÖó ÇáøóĞöí ÍõÑøöãó Úóáóíúßõãú æóÌöÆúÊõßõãú ÈöÃóíóÉò ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú</div><br>  (And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a proof from your Lord) (3:50).  Hence, the Children of Israel treated the Prophets in the worst manner, rejecting some of them and killing some of them. All of this occurred because the Prophets used to command the Jews with what differed from their desires and opinions. The Prophets also upheld the rulings of the Tawrah that the Jews had changed, and this is why it was difficult for them to believe in these Prophets. Therefore, they rejected the Prophets and killed some of them. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóßõáøóãóÇ ÌóÂÁóßõãú ÑóÓõæáñ ÈöãóÇ áÇó Êóåúæóì ÃóäİõÓõßõã ÇÓúÊóßúÈóÑúÊõãú İóİóÑöíŞğÇ ßóĞøóÈúÊõãú æóİóÑöíŞğÇ ÊóŞúÊõáõæäó</div><br>  (Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not,you grew arrogant Some you disbelieved and some you kill). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Jibril is Ruh Al-Qudus</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  The proof that Jibril is the Ruh Al-Qudus is the statement of Ibn Mas`ud in explanation of this Ayah. This is also the view of Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Isma`il bin Khalid, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi and Qatadah. Additionally, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÒóáó Èöåö ÇáÑøõæÍõ ÇáÇøñãöíäõ - Úóáóì ŞóáúÈößó áöÊóßõæäó ãöäó ÇáúãõäúĞöÑöíäó </div><br>  (Which the trustworthy Ruh (Jibril) has brought down. Upon your heart (O Muhammad ) that you may be (one) of the warners) (26:193-194).  Al-Bukhari recorded `A'ishah saying that the Messenger of Allah erected a Minbar in the Masjid on which Hassan bin Thabit (the renowned poet) used to defend the Messenger of Allah (with his poems). The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó ÃóíøöÏú ÍóÓøóÇäó ÈöÑõæÍö ÇáúŞõÏõÓö ßóãóÇ äóÇİóÍó Úóäú äóÈöíøöß»</div><br>  (O Allah! Aid Hassan with Ruh Al-Qudus, for he defended Your Prophet.)  Abu Dawud recorded this Hadith in his Sunan as did At-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan Sahih. Further, Ibn Hibban recorded in his Sahih that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÑõæÍó ÇáúŞõÏõÓö äóİóËó İöí ÑõæÚöí Ãóäøóåõ áóäú ÊóãõæÊó äóİúÓñ ÍóÊøóì ÊóÓúÊóßúãöáó ÑöÒúŞóåóÇ æóÃóÌóáóåóÇ¡ İóÇÊøóŞõæÇ Çááåó æóÃóÌúãöáõæÇ İöí ÇáØøóáóÈ»</div><br>  (Ruh Al-Qudus informed me that no soul shall die until it finishes its set provisions and term limit. Therefore, have Taqwa of Allah and seek your sustenance in the most suitable way.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Jews tried to kill the Prophet</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Az-Zamakhshari commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóİóÑöíŞğÇ ßóĞøóÈúÊõãú æóİóÑöíŞğÇ ÊóŞúÊõáõæäó</div><br>  (Some you disbelieved and some you kill), "Allah did not say `killed' here, because the Jews would still try to kill the Prophet in the future, using poison and magic.'' During the illness that preceded his death, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÒóÇáóÊú ÃóßúáóÉõ ÎóíúÈóÑó ÊõÚóÇæöÏõäöí¡ İóåĞóÇ ÃóæóÇäõ ÇäúŞöØóÇÚö ÃóÈúåóÑöí»</div><br>  (I kept feeling the effect of what I ate (from the poisoned sheep) during the day of Khaybar, until now, when it is the time that the aorta will be cut off (meaning when death is near).)
