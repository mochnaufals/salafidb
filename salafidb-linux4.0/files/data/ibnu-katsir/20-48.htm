They meant that Fir`awn might seize them unexpectedly with a punishment, or transgress against them by tormenting them, when they actually did not deserve it.

Because of this, when the Messenger of Allah wrote a letter to Heraclius, the emperor of Rome, beginning with,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈöÓúãö Çááåö ÇáÑøóÍúãäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö¡ ãöäú ãõÍóãøóÏò ÑóÓõæáö Çááåö Åöáóì åöÑóŞúáó ÚóÙöíãö ÇáÑøõæãö¡ ÓóáóÇãñ Úóáóì ãóäö ÇÊøóÈóÚó ÇáúåõÏì¡ ÃóãøóÇ ÈóÚúÏõ¡ İóÅöäøöí ÃóÏúÚõæßó ÈöÏöÚóÇíóÉö ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãö¡ İóÃóÓúáöãú ÊóÓúáóãú íõÄúÊößó Çááåõ ÃóÌúÑóßó ãóÑøóÊóíúä»</div><br>  (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
