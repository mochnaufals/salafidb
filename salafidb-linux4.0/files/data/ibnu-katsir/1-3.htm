Ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), Ar-Rahim (the Most Merciful)). </div> <br>Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö </div><br>  (Ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), Ar-Rahim (the Most Merciful)) We explained these Names in the Basmalah. Al-Qurtubi said, "Allah has described Himself by `Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim' after saying `the Lord of the Alamin', so His statement here includes a warning, and then an encouragement. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÈøöìÁú ÚöÈóÇÏöì Ãóäøöì ÃóäóÇ ÇáúÛóİõæÑõ ÇáÑøóÍöíãõ - æóÃóäøó ÚóĞóÇÈöì åõæó ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ ÇáÇøñáöíãõ </div><br>  (Declare (O Muhammad ) unto My servants, that truly, I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. And that My torment is indeed the most painful torment.) (15:49-50) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó ÓóÑöíÚõ ÇáúÚöŞóÇÈö æóÅöäøóåõ áóÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (Surely, your Lord is swift in retribution, and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) (6:165)  Hence, Rabb contains a warning while Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim encourages. Further, Muslim recorded in his Sahih that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú íóÚúáóãõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäõ ãóÇ ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ãöäó ÇáúÚõŞõæÈóÉö ãóÇ ØóãöÚó İöí ÌóäøóÊöåö ÃóÍóÏñ¡ æóáóæú íóÚúáóãõ ÇáúßóÇİöÑõ ãóÇ ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ãöäó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÉö ãóÇ ŞóäóØó ãöäú ÑóÍúãóÊöåö ÃóÍóÏñ»</div><br>  (If the believer knew what punishment Allah has, none would have hope in acquiring His Paradise, and if the disbeliever knew what mercy Allah has, none will lose hope of earning His earning.)  </div></body></html>
