They used to say to the polytheists, "A Prophet shall be sent just before the end of this world and we, along with him, shall exterminate you, just as the nations of `Ad and Iram were exterminated.'' Also, Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, "The Jews used to invoke Allah (for the coming of Muhammad ) in order to gain victory over the Aws and Khazraj, before the Prophet was sent. When Allah sent him to the Arabs, they rejected him and denied what they used to say about him. Hence, Mu`adh bin Jabal and Bishr bin Al-Bara' bin Ma`rur, from Bani Salamah, said to them, `O Jews! Fear Allah and embrace Islam. You used to invoke Allah for the coming of Muhammad when we were still disbelievers and you used to tell us that he would come and describe him to us,' Salam bin Mushkim from Bani An-Nadir replied, `He did not bring anything that we recognize. He is not the Prophet we told you about.' Allah then revealed this Ayah about their statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõãú ßöÊóÜÈñ ãøöäú ÚöäÏö Çááøóåö ãõÕóÏøöŞñ áøöãóÇ ãóÚóåõãú</div><br>  (And when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur'an) from Allah confirming what is with them (the Tawrah) and the Injil (Gospel)).'''  Abu Al-`Aliyah said, "The Jews used to ask Allah to send Muhammad so that they would gain victory over the Arab disbelievers. They used to say, `O Allah! Send the Prophet that we read about - in the Tawrah - so that we can torment and kill the disbelievers alongside him.' When Allah sent Muhammad and they saw that he was not one of them, they rejected him and envied the Arabs, even though they knew that he was the Messenger of Allah. Hence, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõã ãøóÇ ÚóÑóİõæÇú ßóİóÑõæÇú Èöåö İóáóÚúäóÉõ Çááøóåö Úóáóì ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (Then when there came to them that which they had recognized, they disbelieved in it.
