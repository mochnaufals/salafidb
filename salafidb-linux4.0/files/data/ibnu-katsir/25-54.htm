In the Two Sahihs (it is reported that the Prophet said:)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈõÚöËúÊõ Åöáóì ÇáúÃóÍúãóÑö æóÇáúÃóÓúæóÏ»</div><br>  (I have been sent to the red and the black. ) And:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóßóÇäó ÇáäøóÈöíøõ íõÈúÚóËõ Åöáóì Şóæúãöåö ÎóÇÕøóÉğ¡ æóÈõÚöËúÊõ Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö ÚóÇãøóÉ»</div><br>  (...A Prophet would be sent to his own people, but I have been sent to all of mankind.)

This was the view of Ibn `Abbas.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÌöåóÇÏÇğ ßóÈíÑÇğ</div><br>  (with the utmost endeavour.) This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÈöìøõ ÌóÜåöÏö ÇáúßõİøóÜÑó æóÇáúãõäóÜİöŞöíäó</div><br>  (O Prophet! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites,) (9:73)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì ãóÑóÌó ÇáúÈóÍúÑóíúäö åóÜĞóÇ ÚóĞúÈñ İõÑóÇÊñ æóåóÜĞóÇ ãöáúÍñ ÃõÌóÇÌñ</div><br>  (And it is He Who has let free the two seas, this is palatable and sweet, and that is salty and bitter;) means, He has created the two kinds of water, sweet and salty. The sweet water is like that in rivers, springs and wells, which is fresh, sweet, palatable water. This was the view of Ibn Jurayj and of Ibn Jarir, and this is the meaning without a doubt, for nowhere in creation is there a sea which is fresh and sweet. Allah has told us about reality so that His servants may realize His blessings to them and give thanks to Him. The sweet water is that which flows amidst people. Allah has portioned it out among His creatures according to their needs; rivers and springs in every land, according to what they need for themselves and their lands.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóÜĞóÇ ãöáúÍñ ÃõÌóÇÌñ</div><br>  (and that is salty and bitter;) meaning that it is salty, bitter and not easy to swallow. This is like the seas that are known in the east and the west, the Atlantic Ocean and the Straits that lead to it, the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and so on, all the seas that are stable and do not flow, but they swell and surge in the winter and when the winds are strong, and they have tides that ebb and flow. At the beginning of each month the tides ebb and flood, and when the month starts to wane they retreat until they go back to where they started. When the crescent of the following month appears, the tide begins to ebb again until the fourteenth of the month, then it decreases. Allah, may He be glorified, the One Whose power is absolute, has set these laws in motion, so all of these seas are stationary, and He has made their water salty lest the air turn putrid because of them and the whole earth turn rotten as a result, and lest the earth spoil because of the animals dying on it. Because its water is salty, its air is healthy and its dead are good (to eat), hence when the Messenger of Allah was asked whether sea water can be used for Wudu', he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åõæó ÇáØøóåõæÑõ ãóÇÄõåõ¡ ÇáúÍöáøõ ãóíúÊóÊõå»</div><br>  (Its water is pure and its dead are lawful.) This was recorded by Malik, Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad, and by the scholars of Sunan with a good Jayyid chain of narration.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáó ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ ÈóÑúÒóÎÇğ æóÍöÌúÑÇğ</div><br>  (and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between them. ) meaning, between the sweet water and the saltwater.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈóÑúÒóÎÇğ</div><br>  (a barrier) means a partition, which is dry land.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍöÌúÑÇğ ãøóÍúÌõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (and a complete partition) means, a barrier, to prevent one of them from reaching the other. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÑóÌó ÇáúÈóÍúÑóíúäö íóáúÊóŞöíóÇäö - ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ ÈóÑúÒóÎñ áÇøó íóÈúÛöíóÇäö İóÈöÃóìøö ÁóÇáÇÁö ÑóÈøößõãóÇ ÊõßóĞøöÈóÇäö </div><br>  (He has let loose the two seas meeting together. Between them is a barrier which none of them can transgress. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny) (55:19-21)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãøóä ÌóÚóáó ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ŞóÑóÇÑÇğ æóÌóÚóáó ÎöáÇóáóåóÂ ÃóäúåóÇÑÇğ æóÌóÚóáó áóåóÇ ÑóæóÇÓöìó æóÌóÚóáó Èóíúäó ÇáúÈóÍúÑóíúäö ÍóÇÌöÒÇğ ÃóÁöáÜåñ ãøóÚó Çááåö Èóáú ÃóßúËóÑõåõãú áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Is not He Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and placed firm mountains therein, and set a barrier between the two seas Is there any god with Allah Nay, but most of them know not!) (27:61)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó ãöäó ÇáúãóÂÁö ÈóÔóÑÇğ</div><br>  (And it is He Who has created man from water,) means, He created man from a weak Nutfah, then gave him shape and formed him, and completed his form, male and female, as He willed.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÌóÚóáóåõ äóÓóÈÇğ æóÕöåúÑÇğ</div><br>  (and has appointed for him kindred by blood, and kindred by marriage.) in the beginning, he is someone's child, then he gets married and becomes a son-in-law, then he himself has sons-in-law and other relatives through marriage. All of this comes from a despised liquid, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÑóÈøõßó ŞóÏöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (And your Lord is Ever All-Powerful to do what He wills.)  </div></body></html>
