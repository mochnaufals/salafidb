This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ŞóÇáõæÇú Çááøóåõãøó Åöä ßóÇäó åóÜĞóÇ åõæó ÇáúÍóŞøó ãöäú ÚöäÏößó İóÃóãúØöÑú ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÍöÌóÇÑóÉğ ãøöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö Ãóæö ÇÆúÊöäóÇ ÈöÚóĞóÇÈò Ãóáöíãò </div><br>  (And (remember) when they said: "O Allah!

Hence He then says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÃóíøöä ãøöä ŞóÑúíóÉò ÃóãúáóíúÊõ áóåóÇ æóåöìó ÙóÜáöãóÉñ Ëõãøó ÃóÎóĞúÊõåóÇ æóÅöáóìøó ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ </div><br>  (And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing. Then I seized it (with punishment). And to Me is the (final) return (of all).) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÏúÎõáõ İõŞóÑóÇÁõ ÇáúãõÓúáöãöíäó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ŞóÈúáó ÇáúÃóÛúäöíóÇÁö ÈöäöÕúİö íóæúãò ÎóãúÓöãöÇÆóÉö ÚóÇã»</div><br>  (The poor among the Muslims will enter Paradise half a day before the rich -- five hundred years.) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i from the Hadith of Ath-Thawri from Muhammad bin `Amr. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih.'' Abu Dawud recorded at the end of Book of Al-Malahim in his Sunan from Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí áóÃóÑúÌõæ Ãóäú áóÇ ÊóÚúÌöÒó ÃõãøóÊöí ÚöäúÏó ÑóÈøöåóÇ Ãóäú íõÄóÎøöÑóåõãú äöÕúİó íóæúã»</div><br>  (I hope that it will not be too much for my Ummah if Allah delays them for half a day.) It was said to Sa`d, "What does half a day mean'' He said, "Five hundred years.''  </div></body></html>
