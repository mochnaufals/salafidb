All I ask of you is that you withhold your evil from me and let me convey the Messages of my Lord. If you will not help me, then do not disturb me, for the sake of the ties of kinship that exist between you and I.' Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, was asked about the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÇáúãóæóÏøóÉó İöì ÇáúŞõÑúÈóì</div><br>  (except to be kind to me for my kinship with you.) Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "To be kind to the family of Muhammad.'' Ibn `Abbas said, "No, you have jumped to a hasty conclusion. There was no clan among Quraysh to whom the Prophet did not have some ties of kinship.'' Ibn `Abbas said, "Except that you uphold the ties of kinship that exist between me and you.'' This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad with a different chain of narration.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóŞúÊóÑöİú ÍóÓóäóÉğ äøóÒöÏú áóåõ İöíåóÇ ÍõÓúäÇğ</div><br>  (And whoever earns a good righteous deed, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof) means, `whoever does a good deed, We will increase him in good for it, i.e., in reward.' This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íóÙúáöãõ ãöËúŞóÇáó ĞóÑøóÉò æóÅöä Êóßõ ÍóÓóäóÉğ íõÖóÜÚöİúåóÇ æóíõÄúÊö ãöä áøóÏõäúåõ ÃóÌúÑÇğ ÚóÙöíãÇğ </div><br>  (Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good, He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.)

(69:44-47) which means, `We would have wrought the utmost vengeance upon him, and no one among mankind would have been able to protect him.' And Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÍöŞøõ ÇáúÍóŞøó ÈößóáöãóÜÊöåö</div><br>  (and establishes the truth by His Word.) means, He establishes it and strengthens it and makes it clear by His Words, i.e., by His evidence and signs.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ Úóáöíãñ ÈöĞóÇÊö ÇáÕøõÏõæÑö</div><br>  (Verily, He knows well what are in the breasts.) means, all that is hidden in the hearts of men.  </div></body></html>
