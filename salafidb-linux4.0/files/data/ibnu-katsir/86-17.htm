It has also been narrated from him that he said, "It means the clouds that contain rain.'' He also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ĞóÇÊö ÇáÑøóÌúÚö </div><br>  (By the sky (having rain clouds) which gives rain, again and again.) "This means that it rains and then it rains (again).'' Qatadah said, "It returns the sustenance of the servants (creatures) every year. Were it not for this, they would all be destroyed and so would their cattle.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÇøÑúÖö ĞóÇÊö ÇáÕøóÏúÚö </div><br>  (And the earth which splits.) Ibn `Abbas said, "Splitting to bring forth plant growths.'' This was also said by Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ áóŞóæúáñ İóÕúáñ </div><br>  (Verily, this is the Word that separates.) Ibn `Abbas said (Fasl is), "True.'' Qatadah also said the same. Someone else said, "A just ruling.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ åæó ÈöÇáúåóÒúáö </div><br>  (And it is not a thing for amusement.) meaning, rather it is serious and true. Then Allah informs about the disbelievers saying that they reject Him and hinder others from His path. Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõãú íóßöíÏõæäó ßóíúÏÇğ </div><br>  (Verily, they are but plotting a plot.) meaning, they plot against the people in their calling them to oppose the Qur'an. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóåøöáö ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (So, give a respite to the disbelievers;) meaning, wait for them and do not be in haste concerning them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãúåöáúåõãú ÑõæóíúÏÇğ</div><br>  (deal gently with them for a while.) meaning, a little while. This means that you will see what befalls them of torment, punishment and destruction. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äõãóÊøöÚõåõãú ŞóáöíáÇğ Ëõãøó äóÖúØóÑøõåõãú Åöáóì ÚóĞóÇÈò ÛóáöíÙò </div><br>  (We let them enjoy for a little while, then in the end We shall oblige them to (enter) a great torment.) (31:24) This is the end of the Tafsir Surat At-Tariq, and unto Allah is all praise and thanks.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
