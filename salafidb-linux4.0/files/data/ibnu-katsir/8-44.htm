The Prophet conveyed this news to his Companions and their resolve strengthened.'' Similar was said by Ibn Ishaq and several others. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÃóÑóÇßóåõãú ßóËöíÑÇğ áøóİóÔöáúÊõãú</div><br>  (If He had shown them to you as many, you would surely, have been discouraged,) you would have cowardly abstained from meeting them and fell in dispute among yourselves,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöäøó Çááøóåó Óóáøóãó</div><br>  (But Allah saved), from all this, when He made you see them as few,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ Úóáöíãñ ÈöĞóÇÊö ÇáÕøõÏõæÑö</div><br>  (Certainly, He is the All-Knower of that is in the breasts.) 8:43.

Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú íõÑöíßõãõæåõãú ÅöĞö ÇáúÊóŞóíúÊõãú İöì ÃóÚúíõäößõãú ŞóáöíáÇğ</div><br>  (And (remember) when you met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes) demonstrates Allah's compassion towards the believers. Allah made them see few disbelievers in their eyes, so that they would be encouraged and feel eager to meet them. Abu Ishaq As-Subai`i said, that Abu `Ubaydah said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "They were made to seem few in our eyes during Badr, so that I said to a man who was next to me, `Do you think they are seventy' He said, `Rather, they are a hundred.' However, when we captured one of them, we asked him and he said, `We were a thousand.''' Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded it. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõŞóáøöáõßõãú İöì ÃóÚúíõäöåöãú</div><br>  (and He made you appear as few in their eyes,) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú íõÑöíßõãõæåõãú ÅöĞö ÇáúÊóŞóíúÊõãú</div><br>  (And (remember) when you met. He showed them to you...), He encouraged each of the two groups against the other, according to `Ikrimah, as recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. This statement has a Sahih chain of narrators. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Yahya bin `Abbad bin `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr narrated to him that his father said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíóŞúÖöíó Çááøóåõ ÃóãúÑÇğ ßóÇäó ãóİúÚõæáÇğ</div><br>  (so that Allah might accomplish a matter already ordained, ) "In order for the war to start between them, so that He would have revenge against those whom He decided to have revenge (pagans), and grant and complete His favor upon those He decided to grant favor to, His supporters.'' The meaning of this, is that Allah encouraged each group against the other and made them look few in each other's eyes, so that they were eager to meet them. This occurred before the battle started, but when it started and Allah supported the believers with a thousand angels in succession, the disbelieving group saw the believers double their number. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ßóÇäó áóßõãú ÁóÇíóÉñ İöí İöÆóÊóíúäö ÇáúÊóŞóÊóÇ İöÆóÉñ ÊõŞóÜÊöáõ İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö æóÃõÎúÑóì ßóÇİöÑóÉñ íóÑóæúäóåõãú ãøöËúáóíúåöãú ÑóÃúìó ÇáúÚóíúäö æóÇááøóåõ íõÄóíøöÏõ ÈöäóÕúÑöåö ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áóÚöÈúÑóÉğ áÇæúáöì ÇáÇøñÈúÕóÜÑö </div><br>  (There has already been a sign for you (O Jews) in the two armies that met (in combat, the battle of Badr). One was fighting in the cause of Allah, and as for the other, (they) were disbelievers. They (disbelievers) saw them (believers) with their own eyes twice their number. And Allah supports with His aid whom He wills. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand.) 3:13  This is how we combine these two Ayat, and certainly, each one of them is true, all the thanks are due to Allah and all the favors are from Him.  </div></body></html>
