Since they were doomed, whenever anything bad happened to any of them they would say, "This is because of Salih and his companions.'' Mujahid said, "They regarded them as bad omens.'' This is similar to what Allah said about the people of Fir`awn:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ÌóÂÁóÊúåõãõ ÇáúÍóÓóäóÉõ ŞóÇáõæÇú áóäóÇ åóÜĞöåö æóÅöä ÊõÕöÈúåõãú ÓóíøöÆóÉñ íóØøóíøóÑõæÇú ÈöãõæÓóì æóãóä ãøóÚóåõ</div><br>  (But whenever good came to them, they said: "Ours is this.''

The apparent meaning of the phrase   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÊõİúÊóäõæäó</div><br>  (are being tested) is: you will be left to get carried away in your state of misguidance.  </div></body></html>
