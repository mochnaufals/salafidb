(170. O mankind! Verily, there has come to you the Messenger with the truth from your Lord. So believe in him, it is better for you. But if you disbelieve, then certainly to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.)  Allah's statement</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÂ ÃóæúÍóíúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó</div><br>  (Verily, We have inspired you...) emphasized the Prophet's prophethood and refuted the idolators and People of the Scripture who denied him.

Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóäÒóáóåõ ÈöÚöáúãöåö</div><br>  (He has sent it down with His knowledge,) The knowledge of His that He willed His servants to have access to. Knowledge about the clear signs of guidance and truth, what Allah likes and is pleased with, what He dislikes and is displeased with, and knowledge of the Unseen, such as the past and the future. This also includes knowledge about His honorable attributes that no sent Messenger or illustrious angel can even know without Allah's leave. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõÍöíØõæäó ÈöÔóíúÁò ãøöäú Úöáúãöåö ÅöáÇøó ÈöãóÇ ÔóÂÁó</div><br>  (And they will never compass anything of His knowledge except that which He wills.) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõÍöíØõæäó Èöåö ÚöáúãÇğ</div><br>  (but they will never compass anything of His knowledge.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ íóÔúåóÏõæäó</div><br>  (and the angels bear witness.) to the truth of what you came with and what was revealed and sent down to you, along with Allah's testimony to the same,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóİóì ÈöÇááøóåö ÔóåöíÏÇğ</div><br>  (And Allah is All-Sufficient as a Witness.) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóÕóÏøõæÇú Úóä ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö ŞóÏú ÖóáøõæÇú ÖóáóÜáÇó ÈóÚöíÏÇğ </div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieve and prevent (others) from the path of Allah, they have certainly strayed far away.) For they are disbelievers themselves and do not follow the truth. They strive hard to prevent people from following and embracing Allah's path. Therefore, they have defied the truth, deviated, and strayed far away from it. Allah also mentions His judgment against those who disbelieve in His Ayat, Book and Messenger, those who wrong themselves by their disbelief and hindering others from His path, committing sins and violating His prohibitions. Allah states that He will not forgive them;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó áöíóåúÏöíóåõãú ØóÑöíŞÇğ</div><br>  (nor will He guide them to a way (that is, of good).)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ØóÑöíŞó Ìóåóäøóãó ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÂ ÃóÈóÏÇğ</div><br>  (Except the way of Hell, to dwell therein forever...) and this is the exception. Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßõãõ ÇáÑøóÓõæáõ ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö ãöä ÑøóÈøößõãú İóÜóÇãöäõæÇú ÎóíúÑÇğ áøóßõãú</div><br>  (O mankind! Verily, there has come to you the Messenger with the truth from your Lord, so believe in him, it is better for you.) This Ayah means, Muhammad has come to you with guidance, the religion of truth and clear proof from Allah. Therefore, believe in what he has brought you and follow him, for this is better for you. Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÊóßúİõÑõæÇú İóÅöäøó ááøóåö ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (But if you disbelieve, then certainly to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth.) Allah is far too rich than to need you or your faith, and no harm could ever affect Him because of your disbelief. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ãõæÓóì Åöä ÊóßúİõÑõæÇú ÃóäÊõãú æóãóä İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÌóãöíÚğÇ İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó áóÛóäöìøñ ÍóãöíÏñ </div><br>  (And Musa said: "If you disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then verily, Allah is Rich (Free of all needs), Owner of all praise.'')  Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ ÚóáöíãÇğ</div><br>  (And Allah is Ever All-Knowing,) He knows those who deserve to be guided, and He will guide them. He also knows those who deserve deviation, and He leads them to it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóßöíãÇğ</div><br>  (All-Wise) in His statements, actions, legislation and all that He decrees.  </div></body></html>
