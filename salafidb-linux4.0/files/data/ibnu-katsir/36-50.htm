While in this state, Allah will command Israfil to blow into the Trumpet, so he will sound a long note and there will be no one left on the face of the earth except he will tilt his head to listen to the sound coming from heaven. Then the people who are alive will be driven to the gathering place by a fire which will surround them on all sides. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó íóÓúÊóØöíÚõæäó ÊóæúÕöíóÉğ</div><br>  (Then they will not be able to make bequest, ) meaning, with regard to their possessions, because the matter is more serious than that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó Åöáóì Ãóåúáöåöãú íóÑúÌöÚõæäó</div><br>  (nor they will return to their family.) Numerous Hadiths and reports have been narrated about this, which we have mentioned elsewhere. After this there will be the Trumpet blast which will cause everyone who is alive to die, besides the One Who is Ever Living, Eternal. Then after that the trumpet blast of the resurrection will be sounded.  </div></body></html>
