This is a form of forsaking it and rejecting it, and not believing in it is the same as forsaking it, and not pondering its meanings and trying to understand it is the same as forsaking it, and not acting upon it and following its commandments and heeding its prohibitions is the same as forsaking it, and turning away from it in favor of poetry or other words or songs or idle talk or some other way is the same as forsaking it. We ask Allah, the Most Generous, the Bestower of bounty, the One Who is able to do what He wills, to keep us safe from doing that which earns His wrath and to use us to do that which will earn His pleasure of preserving and understanding His Book, following its commandments night and day in the manner which He loves and which pleases Him, for He is Generous and Kind.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞóáößó ÌóÚóáúäóÇ áößõáøö äóÈöìøò ÚóÏõæøÇğ ãøöäó ÇáúãõÌúÑöãöíäó</div><br>  (Thus have We made for every Prophet an enemy among the criminals.) means, `just as there is for you, O Muhammad, those people who scorned the Qur'an, so in all the previous nations did Allah make for every Prophet an enemy among the criminals, who called people to their misguidance and disbelief,' as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞóáößó ÌóÚóáúäóÇ áößõáøö äöÈöìøò ÚóÏõæøÇğ ÔóíóÜØöíäó ÇáÅöäúÓö æóÇáúÌöäøö</div><br>  (And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies -- Shayatin among mankind and Jinn) as stated in these two Ayat.
