This Ayah refers to the truth that is attested to by the sound, straight minds that oppose misguided opinions and ideas, just as Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóİóãóä ßóÇäó Úóáóì ÈóíøöäóÉò ãøöä ÑøóÈøöåö æóíóÊúáõæåõ ÔóÇåöÏñ ãøöäúåõ</div><br>  (Can they (Muslims) who rely on a clear proof from their Lord, and whom a witness from Him follows it (be equal with the disbelievers).)(11:17),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöØúÑóÉó Çááøóåö ÇáøóÊöì İóØóÑó ÇáäøóÇÓó ÚóáóíúåóÇ</div><br>  (Allah's Fitra (religion) with which He has created mankind.)

Surely, what the Prophets brought forth is the truth, beyond which there is no truth, just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóãøóÊú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó ÕöÏúŞÇğ æóÚóÏúáÇğ</div><br>  (And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice.)(6:115), His Word is true in what it conveys, and just in all its orders and prohibitions. This is why the believers say, when they take up their rooms in Paradise and assume their high grades and lined thrones,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóãúÏõ áöáøóåö ÇáøóĞöì åóÏóÇäóÇ áöåóÜĞóÇ æóãóÇ ßõäøóÇ áöäóåúÊóÏöìó áóæúáÇ Ãóäú åóÏóÇäóÇ Çááøóåõ áóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóÊú ÑõÓõáõ ÑóÈøöäóÇ ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (All praise is due to Allah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, were it not that Allah had guided us! Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth.)(7:43) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Benefits of Iron</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÒúáúäóÇ ÇáúÍóÏöíÏó İöíåö ÈóÃúÓñ ÔóÏöíÏñ</div><br>  (And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power,) meaning, `We made iron a deterrent for those who refuse the truth and oppose it after the proof has been established against them.' Allah's Messenger remained in Makkah for thirteen years. During that time, the revelation continued being sent to him, containing arguments against the idolators and explaining Tawhid with detail and proofs. When the evidence was established against those who defied the Messenger , Allah decreed the Hijrah. Then He ordered the believers to fight the disbelievers using swords, using them to strike the necks and foreheads of those who opposed, rejected and denied the Qur'an. Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈõÚöËúÊõ ÈöÇáÓøóíúİö Èóíúäó íóÏóíö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÍóÊúì íõÚúÈóÏó Çááåõ æóÍúÏóåõ áóÇ ÔóÑöíßó áóåõ¡ æóÌõÚöáó ÑöÒúŞöí ÊóÍúÊó Ùöáøö ÑõãúÍöí¡ æóÌõÚöáó ÇáĞøöáøóÉõ æÇáÕøóÛóÇÑõ Úóáóì ãóäú ÎóÇáóİó ÃóãúÑöí¡ æóãóäú ÊóÔóÈøóåó ÈöŞóæúãò İóåõæó ãöäúåõã»</div><br>  (I was sent with the sword just before the Hour so that Allah be worshipped alone without partners. My provision was placed under the shadow of my spear, and those who defy my order were disgraced and humiliated, and he who imitates a people is one of them.) This is why Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöíåö ÈóÃúÓñ ÔóÏöíÏñ</div><br>  (wherein is mighty power,) in reference to weapons, such as swords, spears, daggers, arrows, shields, and so forth,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóäóÜİöÚõ áöáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (as well as many benefits for mankind,) meaning, in their livelihood, such as using it to make coins, hammers, axes, saws chisels, shovels and various tools that people use for tilting the land, sowing, cooking, making dough and manufacturing other objects necessary for their livelihood. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöíóÚúáóãó Çááøóåõ ãóä íóäÕõÑõåõ æóÑõÓõáóåõ ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö</div><br>  (that Allah may test who it is that will help Him (His religion) and His Messengers in the unseen.) meaning, whose intention by carrying weapons is the defense of Allah (His religion) and His Messenger,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó Şóæöìøñ ÚóÒöíÒñ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah is Powerful, Almighty.) meaning, surely, Allah is Powerful, Almighty, and He gives victory to those who give victory and aid to Him. However, Allah does not need mankind's help, but He ordered Jihad to test people with each other.  </div></body></html>
