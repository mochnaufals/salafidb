And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) servants.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÇÏóæúÇú íãóÜáößõ</div><br>  (And they will cry: "O Malik...'') who is the keeper of Hell. Al-Bukhari said, "Hajjaj bin Minhal told us, Sufyan bin `Uyaynah told us, from `Amr bin `Ata, ' from Safwan bin Ya`la that his father, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah reciting on the Minbar:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÇÏóæúÇú íãóÜáößõ áöíóŞúÖö ÚóáóíúäóÇ ÑóÈøõßó</div><br>  (And they will cry: "O Malik!

But it will be as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íõŞúÖóì Úóáóíúåöãú İóíóãõæÊõæÇú æóáÇó íõÎóİøóİõ Úóäúåõãú ãøöäú ÚóĞóÇÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them) (35:36).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÊóÌóäøóÈõåóÇ ÇáÇøñÔúŞóì - ÇáøóĞöì íóÕúáóì ÇáäøóÇÑó ÇáúßõÈúÑóì - Ëõãøó áÇó íóãõæÊõ İöíåóÇ æóáÇó íóÍúíóÇ </div><br>  (But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).) (87:11-13). When they ask to be allowed to die, Malik will answer them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó Åöäøóßõãú ãøóÜßöËõæäó</div><br>  He will say: Verily, you shall abide forever. meaning, you will have no way out from it and no refuge. Then the reason why they are doomed will be given, which is their stubborn resistance to the truth. Alla0h says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÌöÆúäóÜßõã ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (Indeed We have brought the truth to you, ) meaning, `We have explained it to you clearly and in detail.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöäøó ÃóßúËóÑóßõãú áöáúÍóŞøö ßóÜÑöåõæäó</div><br>  (but most of you have a hatred for the truth.) means, `but your nature could not accept it and did not seek it; on the contrary, you followed and venerated falsehood, and you stood in the way of truth and refused it, and despised its followers.' So they will blame themselves and will feel regret at the time when regret will not be of any benefit to them. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÃóÈúÑóãõæÇú ÃóãúÑÇğ İóÅöäøóÇ ãõÈúÑöãõæäó </div><br>  (Or have they plotted some plan Then We too are planning.) Mujahid said, "They wanted to plot some evil, but We are also planning.'' What Mujahid said is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóßóÑõæÇú ãóßúÑÇğ æóãóßóÑúäóÇ ãóßúÑÇğ æóåõãú áÇó íóÔúÚõÑõæäó </div><br>  (So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.) (27:50). The idolators were trying their utmost to find ways of refuting the truth with falsehood, but Allah planned it so that the consequences of that would backfire on them. He said in refutation:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú íóÍúÓóÈõæäó ÃóäøóÇ áÇó äóÓúãóÚõ ÓöÑøóåõãú æóäóÌúæóåõã</div><br>  (Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel) meaning, what they say secretly and openly.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáóì æóÑõÓõáõäóÇ áóÏóíúåöãú íóßúÊõÈõæäó</div><br>  (Yes (We do) and Our messengers are by them, to record.) means, `We know what they are doing, and the angels are also recording their deeds, major and minor.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú Åöä ßóÇäó áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö æóáóÏñ İóÃóäóÇú Ãóæøóáõ ÇáúÚóÜÈöÏöíäó </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓõÈúÍóÜäó ÑóÈø ÇáÓøóãóÜæÊö æóÇáÇúÑúÖö ÑóÈø ÇáúÚóÑúÔö ÚóãøóÇ íóÕöİõæäó- İóĞóÑúåõãú íóÎõæÖõæÇú æóíóáúÚóÈõæÇú ÍóÊøóì íõáóÜŞõæÇú íóæúãóåõãõ ÇáøóĞöì íõæÚóÏõæäó- æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì İöì ÇáÓøóãÂÁ ÅöáóÜåñ æóİöì ÇáÇúÑúÖö ÅöáóÜåñ æóåõæó ÇáúÍóßöíãõ ÇáúÚóáöíãõ-</div><br>  </div></body></html>
