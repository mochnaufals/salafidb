Verily, Shaytan does not enter the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is recited.) At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Sahih.  Also, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "Shaytan flees from the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is heard.'' This Hadith was collected by An-Nasa'i in Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, and Al-Hakim recorded it in his Mustadrak, and then said that its chain of narration is authentic, although the Two Sahihs did not collect it. In his Musnad, Ad-Darimi recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said, "Shaytan departs the house where Surat Al-Baqarah is being recited, and as he leaves, he passes gas.'' Ad-Darimi also recorded that Ash-Sha`bi said that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "Whoever recites ten Ayat from Surat Al-Baqarah in a night, then Shaytan will not enter his house that night. (These ten Ayat are) four from the beginning, Ayat Al-Kursi (255), the following two Ayat (256-257) and the last three Ayat.'' In another narration, Ibn Mas`ud said, "Then Shaytan will not come near him or his family, nor will he be touched by anything that he dislikes. Also, if these Ayat were to be recited over a senile person, they would wake him up.''  Further, Sahl bin Sa`d said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó áößõáøö ÔóíúÁò ÓóäóÇãğÇ¡ æóÅöäøó ÓóäóÇãó ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö ÇáúÈóŞóÑóÉõ¡ æóÅöäøó ãóäú ŞóÑóÃóåóÇ İöí ÈóíúÊöåö áóíúáóÉğ áóãú íóÏúÎõáúåõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäõ ËóáóÇËó áóíóÇáò¡ æóãóäú ŞóÑóÃóåóÇ İöí ÈóíúÊöåö äóåóÇÑğÇ áóãú íóÏúÎõáúåõ ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäõ ËóáóÇËóÉó ÃóíøóÇã»</div><br>  (Everything has a hump (or, high peek), and Al-Baqarah is the high peek of the Qur'an. Whoever recites Al-Baqarah at night in his house, then Shaytan will not enter that house for three nights. Whoever recites it during a day in his house, then Shaytan will not enter that house for three days.) This Hadith was collected by Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani, Abu Hatim Ibn Hibban in his Sahih and Ibn Marduwyah.  At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, "The Messenger of Allah sent an expedition force comprising of many men and asked each about what they memorized of the Qur'an. The Prophet came to one of the youngest men among them and asked him, `What have you memorized (of the Qur'an) young man' He said, `I memorized such and such Surahs and also Al-Baqarah.' The Prophet said, `You memorized Surat Al-Baqarah' He said, `Yes.' The Prophet said, `Then you are their commander.' One of the noted men (or chiefs) commented, `By Allah! I did not learn Surat Al-Baqarah, for fear that I would not be able to implement it. The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóÚóáøóãõæÇ ÇáŞõÑúÂäó æóÇŞúÑóÁõæåõ¡ İóÅöäøó ãóËóáó ÇáúŞõÑúÂäö áöãóäú ÊóÚóáøóãóåõ İóŞóÑóÃó æóŞóÇãó Èöåö ßóãóËóáö ÌöÑóÇÈò ãóÍúÔõæó ãöÓúßğÇ íóİõæÍõ ÑöíÍõåõ İöí ßõáøö ãóßóÇäò¡ æóãóËóáõ ãóäú ÊóÚóáøóãóåõ İóíóÑúŞõÏõ æóåõæó İöí Ìóæúİöåö ßóãóËóáö ÌöÑóÇÈò Ãõæßöíó Úóáì ãöÓúß»</div><br>  (Learn Al-Qur'an and recite it, for the example of whoever learns the Qur'an, recites it and adheres to it, is the example of a bag that is full of musk whose scent fills the air. The example of whoever learns the Qur'an and then sleeps (i.e. lazy) while the Qur'an is in his memory, is the example of a bag that has musk, but is closed tight.)  This is the wording collected by At-Tirmidhi, who said that this Hadith is Hasan. In another narration, At-Tirmidhi recorded this same Hadith in a Mursal manner, so Allah knows best.  Also, Al-Bukhari recorded that Usayd bin Hudayr said that he was once reciting Surat Al-Baqarah while his horse was tied next to him. The horse started to make some noise. When Usayd stopped reciting, the horse stopped moving about. When he resumed reading, the horse started moving about again. When he stopped reciting, the horse stopped moving, and when he resumed reading, the horse started to move again. Meanwhile, his son Yahya was close to the horse, and he feared that the horse might step on him. When he moved his son back, he looked up to the sky and saw a cloud radiating with light that looked like lamps. In the morning, he went to the Prophet and told him what had happened and then said, "O Messenger of Allah! My son Yahya was close to the horse and I feared that she might step on him. When I attended to him and raised my head to the sky, I saw a cloud with lights like lamps. So I went, but I couldn't see it.'' The Prophet said, "Do you know what that was'' He said, "No.'' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Êöáúßó ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉõ ÏóäóÊú áöÕóæúÊößó æóáóæ ŞóÑóÃúÊó áóÃóÕúÈóÍúÊó íóäúÙõÑõ ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÅöáóíúåóÇ¡ áóÇ ÊóÊóæÇÑóì ãöäúåõã»</div><br>  (They were the angels, they came close hearing your voice (reciting Surat Al-Baqarah), and if you had kept reading, the people would have been able to see the angels when the morning came, and the angels would not be hidden from their eyes.)  This is the narration reported by Imam Abu Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Salam in his book Fada'il Al-Qur'an. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Virtues of Surat Al-Baqarah and Surat Al `Imran</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad said that Abu Nu`aym narrated to them that Bishr bin Muhajir said that `Abdullah bin Buraydah narrated to him from his father, "I was sitting with the Prophet and I heard him say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóÚóáøóãõæÇ ÓõæÑóÉó ÇáúÈóŞóÑóÉö İóÅöäøó ÃóÎúĞóåóÇ ÈóÑóßóÉñ¡ æóÊóÑúßóåóÇ ÍóÓúÑóÉñ¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÓúÊóØöíÚõåóÇ ÇáúÈóØóáóÉ»</div><br>  (Learn Surat Al-Baqarah, because in learning it there is blessing, in ignoring it there is sorrow, and the sorceresses cannot memorize it.)

The Qur'an will ask him, 'Do you know me' The man will say, 'I do not know you.' The Qur'an will say, 'I am your companion, the Qur'an, which has brought you thirst during the heat and made you stay up during the night. Every merchant has his certain trade. But, this Day, you are behind all types of trade.' Kingship will then be given to him in his right hand, eternal life in his left hand and the crown of grace will be placed on his head. His parents will also be granted two garments that the people of this life could never afford. They will say, 'Why were we granted these garments' It will be said, 'Because your son was carrying the Qur'an.' It will be said (to the reader of the Qur'an), 'Read and ascend through the levels of Paradise.' He will go on ascending as long as he recites, whether reciting slowly or quickly.)''  Ibn Majah also recorded part of this Hadith from Bishr bin Al-Muhajir, and this chain of narrators is Hasan, according to the criteria of Imam Muslim.  A part of this Hadith is also supported by other Hadiths. For instance, Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Umamah Al-Bahili said that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇŞúÑóÃõæÇ ÇáúŞõÑúÂäó İóÅöäøóåõ ÔóÇİöÚñ áöÃóåúáöåö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÇŞúÑóÃõæÇ ÇáÒøóåúÑóÇæóíúäö¡ ÇáúÈóŞóÑóÉó æóÂáó ÚöãúÑóÇäó¡ İóÅöäøóåõãóÇ íóÃúÊöíóÇäö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ßóÃóäøóåõãóÇ ÛóãóÇãóÊóÇäö¡ Ãóæú ßóÃóäøóåõãóÇ ÛóíóÇíóÊóÇäö Ãóæú ßóÃóäøóåõãóÇ İöÑúŞóÇäö ãöäú ØóíúÑò ÕóæóÇİøó¡ íõÍóÇÌøóÇäö Úóäú ÃóåúáöåöãóÇ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (Read the Qur'an, because it will intercede on behalf of its people on the Day of Resurrection. Read the two lights, Al-Baqarah and Al `Imran, because they will come in the shape of two clouds, two shades or two lines of birds on the Day of Resurrection and will argue on behalf of their people on that Day.)  The Prophet then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>« ÇŞúÑóÃõæÇ ÇáúÈóŞóÑóÉó İóÅöäøó ÃóÎúĞóåóÇ ÈóÑóßóÉñ æóÊóÑúßóåóÇ ÍóÓúÑóÉñ æóáóÇ ÊóÓúÊóØöíÚõåóÇ ÇáúÈóØóáóÉ»</div><br>  (Read Al-Baqarah, because in having it there is blessing, and in ignoring there is a sorrow and the sorceresses cannot memorize it.)  Also, Imam Muslim narrated this Hadith in the Book of Prayer  Imam Ahmad narrated that An-Nawwas bin Sam`an said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÄúÊóì ÈöÇáŞõÑúÂäö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö æóÃóåúáöåö ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóÇäõæÇ íóÚúãóáõæäó Èöåö ÊóŞúÏóãõåõã ÓõæÑóÉõ ÇáúÈóŞóÑóÉö æóÂáõ ÚöãúÑóÇä»</div><br>  (On the Day of Resurrection the Qur'an and its people who used to implement it will be brought forth, preceded by Surat Al-Baqarah and Al `Imran.)  An-Nawwas said, "The Prophet set three examples for these two Surahs and I did not forget these examples ever since. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóÃóäøóåõãóÇ ÛóãóÇãóÊóÇäö¡ Ãóæú ÙõáøóÊóÇäö ÓóæÏóÇæóÇäö ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ ÔóÑúŞñ¡ Ãóæú ßóÃóäøóåõãóÇ İöÑúŞóÇäö ãöäú ØóíúÑò ÕóæóÇİøó¡ íõÍóÇÌøóÇäö Úóäú ÕóÇÍöÈöåöãóÇ»</div><br>  (They will come like two clouds, two dark shades or two lines of birds arguing on behalf of their people.)  It was also recorded in Sahih Muslim and At-Tirmidhi narrated this Hadith, which he rendered Hasan Gharib. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in Al-Madinah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  There is no disagreement over the view that Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in its entirety in Al-Madinah. Moreover, Al-Baqarah was one of the first Surahs to be revealed in Al-Madinah, while, Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú íóæúãğÇ ÊõÑúÌóÚõæäó İöíåö Åöáóì Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah.) (2:281) was the last Ayah to be revealed from the Qur'an. Also, the Ayat about usury were among the last Ayat to be revealed. Khalid bin Ma`dan used to call Al-Baqarah the Fustat (tent) of the Qur'an. Some of the scholars said that it contains a thousand news incidents, a thousand commands and a thousand prohibitions. Those who count said that the number of Al-Baqarah's Ayat is two hundred and eighty-seven, and its words are six thousand two hundred and twenty-one words. Further, its letters are twenty-five thousand five hundred. Allah knows best.  Ibn Jurayj narrated that `Ata' said that Ibn `Abbas said, "Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in Al-Madinah.'' Also, Khasif said from Mujahid that `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr said; "Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed in Al-Madinah.'' Several Imams and scholars of Tafsir issued similar statements, and there is no difference of opinion over this as we have stated.  The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn Mas`ud kept the Ka`bah on his left side and Mina on his right side and threw seven pebbles (at the Jamrah) and said, "The one to whom Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed (i.e. the Prophet ) performed Rami (the Hajj rite of throwing pebbles) similarly.'' The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith.  Further, Ibn Marduwyah reported a Hadith of Shu`bah from `Aqil bin Talhah from `Utbah bin Marthad; "The Prophet saw that his Companions were not in the first lines and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÃóÕúÍóÇÈó ÓõæÑóÉö ÇáúÈóŞóÑóÉ»</div><br>  (O Companions of Surat Al-Baqarah.) I Think that this incident occurred during the battle of Hunayn when the Companions retreated. Then, the Prophet commanded Al-`Abbas (his uncle) to yell out,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ÃóÕúÍóÇÈó ÇáÔøóÌóÑóÉ»</div><br>  (O Companions of the tree!) meaning the Companions who participated in the pledge of Ar-Ridwan (under the tree). In another narration, Al- `Abbas cried, "O Companions of Surat Al-Baqarah!'' encouraging them to come back, so they returned from every direction. Also, during the battle of Al-Yamamah, against the army of Musaylimah the Liar, the Companions first retreated because of the huge number of soldiers in Musaylimah's army. The Muhajirun and the Ansar called out for each other, saying; "O people of Surat Al-Baqarah!'' Allah then gave them victory over their enemy, may Allah be pleased with all of the companions of all the Messengers of Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÓúãö Çááøóåö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãö </div><br>  </div></body></html>
