The angels came to Ibrahim on their way to the people of Prophet Lut (to destroy them) and they delivered the good news of a child to Ibrahim and his wife. Ibrahim's wife was amazed at the news,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáóÊú íæóíúáóÊóÇ ÁóÃóáöÏõ æóÃóäóÇú ÚóÌõæÒñ æóåóÜĞóÇ ÈóÚúáöì ÔóíúÎğÇ Åöäøó åóÜĞóÇ áóÔóìúÁñ ÚóÌöíÈñ - ŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóÊóÚúÌóÈöíäó ãöäú ÃóãúÑö Çááøóåö ÑóÍúãóÊõ Çááøóåö æóÈóÑóßóÜÊõåõ Úóáóíúßõãú Ãóåúáó ÇáúÈóíúÊö Åöäøóåõ ÍóãöíÏñ ãøóÌöíÏñ </div><br>  (She said (in astonishment): "Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband, an old man Verily! This is a strange thing!'' They said: "Do you wonder at the decree of Allah The mercy of Allah and His blessings be on you, O the family of Ibrahim. Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.'') 11:72-73 The angels also gave them the good news that Ishaq will be a Prophet and that he will have offspring of his own. In another Ayah, Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóÔøóÑúäóÜåõ ÈöÅöÓúÍóÜŞó äóÈöíøÇğ ãøöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó </div><br>  (And We gave him the good news of Ishaq a Prophet from the righteous.)37:112, which perfects this good news and completes the favor. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóãöä æóÑóÂÁö ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó íóÚúŞõæÈó</div><br>  (of Ishaq, and after him, of Ya`qub...) 11:71, meaning, this child will have another child in your lifetime, so that your eyes are comforted by him, just as your eyes will be comforted by his father. Certainly, one becomes jubilant and joyous when he becomes a grandfather, because this means that his offspring will continue to exist. It was also expected that if an elderly couple had children, due to the child's weakness, he would have no offspring. This is why Allah delivered the good news of Ishaq and of his son Ya`qub, whose name literally means `multiplying and having offspring'. This was a reward for Ibrahim who left his people and migrated from their land so that he could worship Allah alone. Allah compensated Ibrahim with better than his people and tribe when He gave him righteous children of his own, who would follow his religion, so that his eyes would be comforted by them. In another Ayah, Allah said; a   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÇÚúÊóÒóáóåõãú æóãóÇ íóÚúÈõÏõæäó ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö æóåóÈúäóÇ áóåõ ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóíóÚúŞõæÈó æóßõáÇøğ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ äóÈöíøÇğ </div><br>  (So when he turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Ya`qub, and each one of them We made a Prophet.) 19:49 Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóåóÈúäóÇ áóåõ ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóíóÚúŞõæÈó ßõáÇøğ åóÏóíúäóÇ</div><br>  (And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya`qub, each of them We guided,) Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõæÍÇğ åóÏóíúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (and before him, We guided Nuh...) meaning, We guided Nuh before and gave him righteous offspring, just as We guided Ibrahim and gave him righteous children. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Qualities of Nuh and Ibrahim</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Each of these two Prophets had special qualities. When Allah caused the people of the earth to drown, except those who believed in Nuh and accompanied him in the ark, Allah made the offspring of Nuh the dwellers of the earth thereafter. Ever since that occurred, the people of the earth were and still are the descendants of Nuh. As for Ibrahim, Allah did not send a Prophet after him but from his descendants. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöì ĞõÑøöíøóÊöåöãóÇ ÇáäøõÈõæøóÉó æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (And We ordained among his (Ibrahim's) offspring prophethood and the Book.) 29:27,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ äõæÍÇğ æóÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöì ĞõÑøöíøóÊöåöãóÇ ÇáäøõÈõæøóÉó æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (And indeed, We sent Nuh and Ibrahim, and placed in their offspring Prophethood and the Book.) 57:26, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæáóÜÆößó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóäúÚóãó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöã ãøöäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíúäó ãöä ĞõÑøöíøóÉö ÁÇÏóãó æóãöãøóäú ÍóãóáúäóÇ ãóÚó äõæÍò æóãöä ĞõÑøöíøóÉö ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó æóãöãøóäú åóÏóíúäóÇ æóÇÌúÊóÈóíúäóÂ ÅöĞóÇ ÊõÊúáóì Úóáóíúåöãú ÁÇíóÜÊõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÎóÑøõæÇú ÓõÌøóÏÇğ æóÈõßöíøÇğ </div><br>  (Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and Isra'il and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Beneficent (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping.) 19:58 Allah said in this honorable Ayah here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ĞõÑøöíøóÊöåö</div><br>  (and among his progeny...) meaning, We guided from among his offspring,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÏóÇæõæÏó æóÓõáóíúãóÜäó</div><br>  (Dawud, Sulayman...) from the offspring of Nuh, according to Ibn Jarir. It is also possible that the Ayah refers to Ibrahim since it is about him that the blessings were originally mentioned here, although Lut is not from his offspring, for he was Ibrahim's nephew, the son of his brother Maran, the son of Azar. It is possible to say that Lut was mentioned in Ibrahim's offspring as a generalization. As Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ßõäÊõãú ÔõåóÏóÂÁó ÅöĞú ÍóÖóÑó íóÚúŞõæÈó ÇáúãóæúÊõ ÅöĞú ŞóÇáó áöÈóäöíåö ãóÇ ÊóÚúÈõÏõæäó ãöä ÈóÚúÏöì ŞóÇáõæÇú äóÚúÈõÏõ ÅöáóÜåóßó æóÅöáóÜåó ÂÈóÂÆößó ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóÅöÓúãóÜÚöíáó æóÅöÓúÍóÜŞó ÅöáóÜåğÇ æóÇÍöÏğÇ æóäóÍúäõ áóåõ ãõÓúáöãõæäó </div><br>  (Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya`qub When he said unto his sons, "What will you worship after me'' They said, "We shall worship your God, and the God of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma`il, Ishaq, One God, and to Him we submit.'') 2:133. Here, Isma`il was mentioned among the ascendants of Ya`qub, although he was Ya`qub's uncle. Similarly Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóÌóÏó ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ ßõáøõåõãú ÃóÌúãóÚõæäó - ÅöáÇøó ÅöÈúáöíÓó ÃóÈóì Ãóä íóßõæäó ãóÚó ÇáÓøóÜÌöÏöíäó </div><br>  (So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together. Except Iblis -- he refused to be among those to prostrate.) 15:30-31. Allah included Iblis in His order to the angels to prostrate, and chastised him for his opposition, all because he was similar to them in that (order), so he was considered among them in general, although he was a Jinn. Iblis was created from fire while the angels were created from light. Mentioning `Isa in the offspring of Ibrahim, or Nuh as we stated above, is proof that the grandchildren from a man's daughter's side are included among his offspring. `Isa is included among Ibrahim's progeny through his mother, although `Isa did not have a father. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Harb bin Abi Al-Aswad said, "Al-Hajjaj sent to Yahya bin Ya`mar, saying, `I was told that you claim that Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn are from the offspring of the Prophet , did you find it in the Book of Allah I read the Qur'an from beginning to end and did not find it.' Yahya said, `Do you not read in Surat Al-An`am,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä ĞõÑøöíøóÊöåö ÏóÇæõæÏó æóÓõáóíúãóÜäó</div><br>  (and among his progeny Dawud, Sulayman...) until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÍúíóì æóÚöíÓóì</div><br>  (and Yahya and `Isa...) Al-Hajjaj said, `Yes.' Yahya said, `Is not `Isa from the offspring of Ibrahim, although he did not have a father' Al-Hajjaj said, `You have said the truth.''' For example, when a man leaves behind a legacy, a trust, or gift to his "offspring'' then the children of his daughters are included. But if a man gives something to his "sons'', or he leaves a trust behind for them, then that would be particular to his male children and their male children. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäú ÁÇÈóÇÆöåöãú æóĞõÑøöíøóÜÊöåöãú æóÅöÎúæóäöåöãú</div><br>  (And also some of their fathers and their progeny and their brethren,) 6:87, mentions that some of these Prophets' ascendants and descendants were also guided and chosen. So Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÌúÊóÈóíúäóÜåõãú æóåóÏóíúäóÜåõãú Åöáóì ÕöÑóØò ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò</div><br>  (We chose them, and We guided them to a straight path.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Shirk Eradicates the Deeds, Even the Deeds of the Messengers</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó åõÏóì Çááøóåö íóåúÏöì Èöåö ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöåö</div><br>  (This is the guidance of Allah with which He guides whomsoever He wills of His servants.) meaning, this occurred to them by Allah's leave and because He directed them to guidance.

This magnifies the serious danger of Shirk and the gravity of committing it.

This Ayah means, if the Quraysh and the rest of the people of the earth - Arabs and non-Arabs, illiterate and the People of the Scripture - disbelieve in these bounties, then We have entrusted them to another people, the Muhajirun and Ansar, and those who follow their lead until the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíúÓõæÇú ÈöåóÇ ÈößóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (who are not disbelievers therein.) They will not deny any of these favors, not even one letter. Rather, they will believe in them totally, even the parts that are not so clear to some of them. We ask Allah to make us among them by His favor, generosity and kindness. Addressing His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó</div><br>  (They are...) the Prophets mentioned here, along with their righteous fathers, offspring and bretheren,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó åóÏóì Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (those whom Allah had guided.) meaning, they alone are the people of guidance,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöåõÏóÇåõãõ ÇŞúÊóÏöåú</div><br>  (So follow their guidance.) Imitate them. This command to the Messenger certainly applies to his Ummah, according to what he legislates and commands them. While mentioning this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Mujahid asked Ibn `Abbas, "Is there an instance where prostration is warranted in Surah Sad'' Ibn `Abbas said, "Yes.'' He then recited,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóåóÈúäóÇ áóåõ ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóíóÚúŞõæÈó</div><br>  (...And We bestowed upon him Ishaq and Ya`qub...) until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöåõÏóÇåõãõ ÇŞúÊóÏöåú</div><br>  (...So follow their guidance.) He commented, "He (our Prophet, Muhammad ) was among them.'' In another narration, Mujahid added that Ibn `Abbas said, "Your Prophet was among those whose guidance we were commanded to follow.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõá áÇøó ÃóÓúÃóáõßõãú Úóáóíúåö ÃóÌúÑÇğ</div><br>  (Say: "No reward I ask of you for this.'') means, I do not ask you for any reward for delivering the Qur'an to you, nor anything else,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäú åõæó ÅöáÇøó ĞößúÑóì áöáúÚóÜáóãöíäó</div><br>  ("It is only a reminder for the `Alamin (mankind and Jinns).'') so they are reminded by it and guided from blindness to clarity, from misguidance to guidance, and from disbelief to faith.  </div></body></html>
