And whosoever of them turned aside from Our command, We shall cause him to taste of the torment of the blazing Fire.) (13. They worked for him as he desired on Maharib, Tamathil, large basins like Jawab and Qudur Rasiyat. "Work you, O family of Dawud, with thanks!''

He subjugated the wind to him, so that it would carry his carpet one way for a month, then back again the next month. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "He set out from Damascus in the morning, landed in Istakhar where he ate a meal, then flew on from Istakhar and spent the night in Kabil.'' Between Damascus and Istakhar is an entire month's travel for a swift rider, and between Istakhar and Kabul is an entire month's travel for a swift rider.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÓóáúäóÇ áóåõ Úóíúäó ÇáúŞöØúÑö</div><br>  (And We caused a fount Qitr to flow for him,) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be plased with him, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Malik from Zayd bin Aslam, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others said, "Qitr means copper.'' Qatadah said, "It was in Yemen.'' Allah brought forth all the things that people make for Sulayman, peace be upon him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáúÌöäøö ãóä íóÚúãóáõ Èóíúäó íóÏóíúåö ÈöÅöĞúäö ÑóÈøöåö</div><br>  (and there were Jinn that worked in front of him, by the leave of his Lord.) means, `We subjugated the Jinn to work in front of him,' by the permission of his Lord, i.e., by Allah's decree and subjugation, they built whatever constructions he wanted, and did other work as well.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÒöÛú ãöäúåõãú Úóäú ÃóãúÑöäóÇ</div><br>  (And whosoever of them turned aside from Our command,) means, whoever among them tried to rebel and disobey,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äõĞöŞúåõ ãöäú ÚóĞóÇÈö ÇáÓøóÚöíÑö</div><br>  (We shall cause him to taste of the torment of the blazing Fire.) which means, burning.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚúãóáõæäó áóåõ ãóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ ãöä ãøóÍóÜÑöíÈó æóÊóãóÜËöíáó</div><br>  (They worked for him as he desired on Maharib, Tamathil,) Maharib refers to beautiful structures, the best and innermost part of a dwelling. Ibn Zayd said, "This means dwellings.'' With regard to "Tamathil,'' `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said that Tamathil means pictures.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌöİóÇäò ßóÇáúÌóæóÇÈö æóŞõÏõæÑò ÑóÓöíóÜÊò</div><br>  (large basins like Jawab and Qudur Rasiyat.) Jawab, the plural form of Jabiyah, refers to cisterns or tanks in which water is held, and Qudur Rasiyat are cauldrons that stay in one place and are not moved around because of their great size. This was the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÚúãóáõæÇú ÁóÇáó ÏóÇæõæÏó ÔõßúÑÇğ</div><br>  (Work you, O family of Dawud, with thanks!) means, `We said to them: Work with thanks for the blessings that We have bestowed upon you in this world and the Hereafter.' This indicates that thanks may be expressed by actions as much as by words and intentions. Abu `Abdur-Rahman Al-Hubuli said, "Prayer is thanks, fasting is thanks, every good deed that you do for the sake of Allah is thanks, and the best of thanks is praise.'' This was recorded by Ibn Jarir. In the Two Sahihs, it is reported that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÃóÍóÈøó ÇáÕøóáóÇÉö Åöáóì Çááåö ÊóÚóÇáóì ÕóáóÇÉõ ÏóÇæõÏó¡ ßóÇäó íóäóÇãõ äöÕúİó Çááøóíúáö¡ æóíóŞõæãõ ËõáõËóåõ¡ æóíóäóÇãõ ÓõÏõÓóåõ¡ æóÃóÍóÈøó ÇáÕøöíóÇãö Åöáóì Çááåö ÊóÚóÇáóì ÕöíóÇãõ ÏóÇæõÏó¡ ßóÇäó íóÕõæãõ íóæúãğÇ æóíõİúØöÑõ íóæúãğÇ¡ æóáóÇ íóİöÑøõ ÅöĞóÇ áóÇŞóì»</div><br>  (The most beloved of prayer to Allah is the prayer of Dawud. He used to sleep for half the night, stand in prayer for a third of it and sleep for a sixth of it. The most beloved of fasting to Allah is the fasting of Dawud. He used to fast for a day then not fast for a day, and he never fled the battlefield.) Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Fudayl said concerning the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÚúãóáõæÇú ÁóÇáó ÏóÇæõæÏó ÔõßúÑÇğ</div><br>  (Work you, O family of Dawud, with thanks!) Dawud said, "O Lord! How can I thank you when thanks itself is a blessing from You'' He said: "Now you have truly given thanks to Me, for you have realized that it is a blessing from Me.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóáöíáñ ãøöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöìó ÇáÔøóßõæÑõ</div><br>  But few of My servants are grateful. This is a reflection of reality.  </div></body></html>
