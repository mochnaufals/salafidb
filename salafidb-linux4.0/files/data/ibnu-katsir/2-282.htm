O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down. Let a scribe write it down in justice between you. Let not the scribe refuse to write, as Allah has taught him, so let him write. Let him (the debtor) who incurs the liability dictate, and he must have Taqwa of Allah, his Lord, and diminish not anything of what he owes. But if the debtor is of poor understanding, or weak, or is unable to dictate for himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her. And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called (for evidence). You should not become weary to write it (your contract), whether it be small or big, for its fixed term, that is more just with Allah; more solid as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves, save when it is a present trade which you carry out on the spot among yourselves, then there is no sin on you if you do not write it down.

Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir recorded that Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib said that he was told that the Ayah most recently revealed from above the Throne -- the last Ayah to be revealed in the Qur'an -- was the Ayah about debts.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÅöĞóÇ ÊóÏóÇíóäÊõã ÈöÏóíúäò Åöáóì ÃóÌóáò ãøõÓóãøğì İóÇßúÊõÈõæåõ</div><br>  (O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down) directs Allah's believing servants to record their business transactions when their term is delayed, to preserve the terms and timing of these transactions, and the memory of witnesses, as mentioned at the end of the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößõãú ÃóŞúÓóØõ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö æóÃóŞúæóãõ áöáÔøóåóÜÏóÉö æóÃóÏúäóì ÃóáÇøó ÊóÑúÊóÇÈõæÇú</div><br>  (that is more just with Allah; more solid as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves.)  The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "Allah's Messenger came to Al-Madinah, while the people were in the habit of paying in advance for fruits to be delivered within one or two years. The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóÓúáóİó¡ İóáúíõÓúáöİú İöí ßóíúáò ãóÚúáõæãò¡ æóæóÒúäò ãóÚúáõæãò¡ Åöáóì ÃóÌóáò ãóÚúáõæã»</div><br>  (Whoever pays money in advance (for dates to be delivered later) should pay it for known specified measure and weight (of the dates) for a specified date. )  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇßúÊõÈõæåõ</div><br>  (write it down) is a command from Him to record such transactions to endorse and preserve their terms. Ibn Jurayj said, "Whoever borrowed should write the terms, and whoever bought should have witnesses.'' Abu Sa`id, Ash-Sha`bi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Al-Hasan, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Zayd said that recording such transactions was necessary before, but was then abrogated by Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäú Ãóãöäó ÈóÚúÖõßõã ÈóÚúÖğÇ İóáúíõÄóÏøö ÇáøóĞöì ÇÄúÊõãöäó ÃóãóÜäóÊóåõ</div><br>  (Then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully).)

Therefore, the scribe is not allowed to cheat any party of the contract and is to only record what the parties of the contract agreed to, without addition or deletion. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÃúÈó ßóÇÊöÈñ Ãóä íóßúÊõÈó ßóãóÇ Úóáøóãóåõ Çááøóåõ İóáúíóßúÊõÈú</div><br>  (Let not the scribe refuse to write, as Allah has taught him, so let him write) means, "Those who know how to write should not refrain from writing transaction contracts when asked to do so.'' Further, let writing such contracts be a type of charity from the scribe for those who are not lettered, just as Allah taught him what he knew not. Therefore, let him write, just as the Hadith stated,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ãöäó ÇáÕøóÏóŞóÉö Ãóäú ÊõÚöíäó ÕóÇäöÚğÇ¡ Ãóæú ÊóÕúäóÚó áöÃóÎúÑóŞ»</div><br>  (It is a type of charity to help a worker and to do something for a feeble person.)  In another Hadith, the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ßóÊóãó ÚöáúãğÇ íóÚúáóãõåõ¡ ÃõáúÌöãó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÈöáöÌóÇãò ãöäú äóÇÑ»</div><br>  (Whoever kept knowledge to himself will be restrained by a bridle made of fire on the Day of Resurrection.) Mujahid and `Ata' said that if asked to do so, "The scribe is required to record.''  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáúíõãúáöáö ÇáøóĞöì Úóáóíúåö ÇáúÍóŞøõ æóáúíóÊøóŞö Çááøóåó ÑóÈøóåõ</div><br>  (Let him (the debtor) who incurs the liability dictate, and he must have Taqwa of Allah, his Lord) indicates that the debtor should dictate to the scribe what he owes, so let him fear Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÈúÎóÓú ãöäúåõ ÔóíúÆÇğ</div><br>  (And diminish not anything of what he owes,) meaning, not hide any portion of what he owes.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅä ßóÇäó ÇáøóĞöì Úóáóíúåö ÇáúÍóŞøõ ÓóİöíåğÇ</div><br>  (But if the debtor is of poor understanding) and is not allowed to decide on such matters, because he used to waste money, for instance,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÖóÚöíİğÇ</div><br>  (Or weak), such as being too young or insane,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú áÇó íóÓúÊóØöíÚõ Ãóä íõãöáøó åõæó</div><br>  (Or is unable to dictate for himself) because of a disease, or ignorance about such matters,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáúíõãúáöáú æóáöíøõåõ ÈöÇáúÚóÏúáö</div><br>  (then let his guardian dictate in justice.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Witnesses Should Attend the Dictation of Contracts</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÓúÊóÔúåöÏõæÇú ÔóåöíÏóíúäö ãøöä ÑøöÌóÇáößõãú</div><br>  (And get two witnesses out of your own men) requiring witnesses to attend the dictation of contracts to further preserve the contents,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä áøóãú íóßõæäóÇ ÑóÌõáóíúäö İóÑóÌõáñ æóÇãúÑóÃóÊóÇäö</div><br>  (And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women) this requirement is only for contracts that directly or indirectly involve money. Allah requires that two women take the place of one man as witness, because of the woman's shortcomings, as the Prophet described. Muslim recorded in his Sahih that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ãóÚúÔóÑó ÇáäøöÓóÇÁö ÊóÕóÏøóŞúäó æóÃóßúËöÑúäó ÇáúÇÓúÊöÛúİóÇÑó¡ İóÅöäøöí ÑóÃóíúÊõßõäøó ÃóßúËóÑó Ãóåúáö ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (O women!

Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÃúÈó ßóÇÊöÈñ Ãóä íóßúÊõÈó ßóãóÇ Úóáøóãóåõ Çááøóåõ İóáúíóßúÊõÈú</div><br>  (Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so let him write.)  Some say that this Ayah indicates that agreeing to become a witness is Fard Kifayah (required on at least a part of the Muslim Ummah). However, the majority of the scholars say that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÃúÈó ÇáÔøõåóÏóÂÁõ ÅöĞóÇ ãóÇ ÏõÚõæÇú</div><br>  (And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called) is referring to testifying to what the witnesses actually witnessed, thus befitting their description of being `witnesses'. Therefore, when the witness is called to testify to what he witnessed, he is required to give testimony, unless this obligation was already fulfilled, in which case such testimony becomes Fard Kifayah. Mujahid and Abu Mijlaz said, "If you are called to be a witness, then you have the choice to agree. If you witnessed and were called to testify, then come forward.'' It was reported that Ibn `Abbas and Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that the obligation includes both cases, agreeing to be a witness and testifying to what one witnessed.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÓúÜóãõæÇú Ãóä ÊóßúÊõÈõæåõ ÕóÛöíÑğÇ Ãóæú ßóÈöíÑğÇ Åöáóì ÃóÌóáöåö</div><br>  (You should not become weary to write it (your contract), whether it be small or large, for its fixed term) perfects this direction from Allah by commanding that the debt be written, whether the amount is large or small. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÓúÜóãõæÇú</div><br>  (You should not become weary) meaning, do not be discouraged against writing transactions and their terms, whether the amount involved is large or small.

Therefore, recording such agreements helps the witnesses, when they see their handwriting - or signatures - later on and thus remember what they witnessed, for it is possible that the witnesses might forget what they witnessed.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÏúäóì ÃóáÇøó ÊóÑúÊóÇÈõæÇú</div><br>  (And more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves) meaning, this helps repel any doubt.

Or, it could be that having witnesses in such cases is only recommended and not obligatory, as evident from the Hadith that Khuzaymah bin Thabit Al-Ansari narrated which Imam Ahmad collected. `Umarah bin Khuzaymah Al-Ansari said that his uncle, who was among the Prophet's Companions, told him that the Prophet was making a deal for a horse with a bedouin man. The Prophet asked the bedouin to follow him so that he could pay him the price of the horse. The Prophet went ahead of the bedouin. The bedouin met several men who tried to buy his horse, not knowing if the Prophet was actually determined to buy it. Some people offered more money for the horse than the Prophet had. The bedouin man said to the Prophet , "If you want to buy this horse, then buy it or I will sell it to someone else.'' When he heard the bedouin man's words, the Prophet stood up and said, "Have I not bought that horse from you'' The bedouin said, "By Allah! I have not sold it to you.'' The Prophet said, "Rather, I did buy it from you.'' The people gathered around the Prophet and the Bedouin while they were disputing, and the bedouin said, "Bring forth a witness who testifies that I sold you the horse.'' Meanwhile, the Muslims who came said to the bedouin, "Woe to you! The Prophet only says the truth.'' When Khuzaymah bin Thabit came and heard the dispute between the Prophet and the bedouin who was saying, "Bring forth a witness who testifies that I sold you the horse, '' Khuzaymah said, "I bear witness that you sold him the horse.'' The Prophet said to Khuzaymah, "What is the basis of your testimony'' Khuzaymah said, "That I entrusted you, O Messenger of Allah!'' Therefore, the Messenger made Khuzaymah's testimony equal to the testimony of two men. This was also recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa ®299º. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íõÖóÂÑøó ßóÇÊöÈñ æóáÇó ÔóåöíÏñ</div><br>  (Let neither scribe nor witness suffer (or cause) any harm) also indicates that the scribe and the witness must not cause any harm, such as, when the scribe writes other than what he is being dictated, or the witness testifies to other than what he heard or conceals his testimony.
