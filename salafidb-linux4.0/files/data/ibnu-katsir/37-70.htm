This is like the Ayah:</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÔóÌóÑóÉğ ÊóÎúÑõÌõ ãöä ØõæÑö ÓóíúäóÂÁó ÊóäÈõÊõ ÈöÇáÏøõåúäö æóÕöÈúÛò áøöáÃóßöáöíöäó </div><br>  (And a tree that springs forth from Mount Sinai, that grows (produces) oil, and (it is a) relish for the eaters.) (23:20) -- which is the olive tree. This is supported by the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó Åöäøóßõãú ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáÖøóÂáøõæäó ÇáúãõßóĞøöÈõæäó - áÇøßöáõæäó ãöä ÔóÌóÑò ãøöä ÒóŞøõæãò </div><br>  (Then moreover, verily, -- you the erring-ones, the deniers! You, verily, will eat of the trees of Zaqqum.) (56:51-52).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÜåóÇ İöÊúäóÉğ áøöáÙøóÜáöãöíäó </div><br>  (Truly, We have made it (as) a trial for the wrongdoers.) Qatadah said, "The tree of Zaqqum is mentioned as a test for those who are misguided. They said, `Your companion tells you that in the Fire there is a tree, but fire consumes trees.' Then Allah revealed the words:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóåóÇ ÔóÌóÑóÉñ ÊóÎúÑõÌõ İöì ÃóÕúáö ÇáúÌóÍöíãö </div><br>  (Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire.) meaning, it is nourished by the fire, for it was created from fire.'' Mujahid said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÜåóÇ İöÊúäóÉğ áøöáÙøóÜáöãöíäó </div><br>  (Truly, We have made it (as) a trial for the wrongdoers.) Abu Jahl, may Allah curse him, said, "Zaqqum means dates and butter which I eat Atazaqqamuhu.''  I say that the meaning of the Ayah is, "We have told you, O Muhammad, of the tree of Zaqqum as a trial with which We test the people to see who will believe and who will disbelieve.'' This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ ÇáÑøõÁúíóÇ ÇáøóÊöì ÃóÑóíúäóÜßó ÅöáÇøó İöÊúäóÉğ áøöáäøóÇÓö æóÇáÔøóÌóÑóÉó ÇáúãóáúÚõæäóÉó İöì ÇáŞõÑúÁóÇäö æóäõÎóæøöİõåõãú İóãóÇ íóÒöíÏõåõãú ÅöáÇøó ØõÛúíóÇäğÇ ßóÈöíÑğÇ</div><br>  (And We made not the vision which we showed you but a trial for mankind, and the accursed tree in the Qur'an. We warn and make them afraid but it only increases them in naught save great disbelief, oppression and disobedience to Allah) (17:60).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóåóÇ ÔóÌóÑóÉñ ÊóÎúÑõÌõ İöì ÃóÕúáö ÇáúÌóÍöíãö </div><br>  (Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire.) means, its roots grow at the bottom of Hell.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ØóáúÚõåóÇ ßóÃóäøóåõ ÑõÁõæÓõ ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäö </div><br>  (The shoots of its fruit stalks are like the heads of Shayatin. ) this is a description of how ugly and repulsive it is. It is likened to   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑõÁõæÓõ ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäö</div><br>  (the heads of Shayatin ), even though they have never seen them, because it is a well-established idea in people's minds that devils are ugly in appearance.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóåõãú áÇøßöáõæäó ãöäúåóÇ İóãóÇáöÆõæäó ãöäúåóÇ ÇáúÈõØõæäó </div><br>  (Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.) Allah mentions that they will eat of this extremely ugly tree even though its fruit tastes and smells so bad; they will be forced to eat from it because they will not find anything else to eat except this tree and similar things, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíúÓó áóåõãú ØóÚóÇãñ ÅöáÇøó ãöä ÖóÑöíÚò - áÇøó íõÓúãöäõ æóáÇó íõÛúäöì ãöä ÌõæÚò </div><br>  (No food will there be for them but a poisonous thorny plant, Which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger.) (88:6 -7).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó Åöäøó áóåõãú ÚóáóíúåóÇ áóÔóæúÈÇğ ãöäú Íóãöíãò </div><br>  (Then on the top of that they will be boiling Hamim) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "This means they will be given boiling Hamim to drink after they have eaten from Zaqqum.'' According to another report, he said that this means a mixture made from boiling water. Someone else said that it means boiling water will be mixed with pus and offensive discharges that leak from their private parts and eyes. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "When the people of Hell get hungry, they will ask for food from the tree of Zaqqum. They will eat from it, then the skin of their faces will fall off, If someone were to pass by, he would recognize them from their faces. Then thirst will be sent upon them, so they will ask to be given something to drink, and they will be given water like boiling oil that has been heated to the ultimate degree. When it is brought near to their mouths, the flesh of their faces from which the skin has fallen off will be baked by its heat, and whatever is in their stomachs will melt. They will walk with their guts falling out and with their skin falling off, then they will be beaten with hooked rods of iron. Then every part of their bodies will burst into loud lamentations.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó Åöäøó ãóÑúÌöÚóåõãú áÅöáóì ÇáúÌóÍöíãö </div><br>  (Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.) means, after that interval, they will be sent back to the burning fire, searing heat and scorching flames, and they will rotate between the one and the other. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóØõæİõæäó ÈóíúäóåóÇ æóÈóíúäó Íóãöíãò ÁóÇäò </div><br>  (They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling water!) (55:44). Qatadah recited this Ayah when discussing this Ayah. This is a good interpretation. `Abdullah bin Mas`ud recited it differently, with the meaning "Their return in the afternoon.'' `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, used to say: "By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, midday on the Day of Resurrection will not come until the people of Paradise will be in Paradise and the people of Hell will be in Hell.'' Then he recited:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö íóæúãóÆöĞò ÎóíúÑñ ãøõÓúÊóŞóÑøÇğ æóÃóÍúÓóäõ ãóŞöíáÇğ </div><br>  (The dwellers of Paradise will, on that Day, have the best abode, and have the fairest of places for repose) (25:24). Allah's saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõãú ÃóáúİóæúÇú ÁóÇÈóÂÁóåõãú ÖóÂáøöíäó </div><br>  (Verily, they found their fathers on the wrong path;) means, `We will punish them for that because they found their fathers following misguidance and they followed them with no evidence or proof.' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåõãú Úóáóì ÁóÇËóÇÑöåöãú íõåúÑóÚõæäó </div><br>  (So they (too) hastened in their footsteps!) Mujahid said, "This is like running.'' Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "They followed ignorance and foolishness.''  </div></body></html>
