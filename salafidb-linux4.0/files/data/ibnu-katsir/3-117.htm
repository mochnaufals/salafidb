For instance, there is `Abdullah bin Salam, Asad bin `Ubayd, Tha`labah bin Sa`yah, Usayd bin Sa`yah, and so forth. This Ayah means that those among the People of the Book whom Allah rebuked earlier are not at all the same as those among them who embraced Islam. Hence Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓõæÇú ÓóæóÂÁğ</div><br>  (Not all of them are alike) 3:113.''  Therefore, these two types of people are not equal, and indeed, there are believers and also criminals among the People of the Book, just as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö ÃõãøóÉñ ŞóÂÆöãóÉñ</div><br>  (a party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right) for they implement the Book of Allah, adhere to His Law and follow His Prophet Muhammad . Therefore, this type is on the straight path,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÊúáõæäó ÁóÇíóÜÊö Çááøóåö ÁóÇäóÂÁó Çáøóíúáö æóåõãú íóÓúÌõÏõæäó</div><br>  (they recite the verses of Allah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer.)  They often stand in prayer at night for Tahajjud, and recite the Qur'an in their prayer,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóÇáúíóæúãö ÇáÇøñÎöÑö æóíóÃúãõÑõæäó ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİö æóíóäúåóæúäó Úóäö ÇáúãõäúßóÑö æóíõÓóÜÑöÚõæäó İöì ÇáúÎóíúÑóÊö æóÃõæúáóÜÆößó ãöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó </div><br>  (They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin Al-Ma`ruf and forbid Al-Munkar; and they hasten in (all) good works; and they are among the righteous) 3: 114.  This is the same type of people mentioned at the end of the Surah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ãöäú Ãóåúáö ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö áóãóä íõÄúãöäõ ÈöÇááøóåö æóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúßõãú æóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúåöãú ÎóÜÔöÚöíäó ááøóåö</div><br>  (And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), those who believe in Allah and in that which has been revealed to you, and in that which has been revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allah.) 3:199.  Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóİúÚóáõæÇú ãöäú ÎóíúÑò İóáóäú íõßúİóÑæåõ</div><br>  (And whatever good they do, nothing will be rejected of them;) 3:115 meaning, their good deeds will not be lost with Allah. Rather, He will award them the best rewards,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ Úóáöíãñ ÈöÇáúãõÊøóŞöíäó</div><br>  (for Allah knows well the Muttaqin (the pious).) for no deed performed by any person ever escapes His knowledge, nor is any reward for those who do good deeds ever lost with Him. Allah mentions the disbelieving polytheists:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóä ÊõÛúäöìó Úóäúåõãú Ãóãúæóáõåõãú æóáÇó ÃóæúáÜÏõåõã ãøöäó Çááøóåö ÔóíúÆğÇ</div><br>  (neither their properties nor their offspring will avail them against Allah) 3:116. meaning, nothing can avert Allah's torment and punishment from striking them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõæúáÜÆößó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáäøóÇÑö åõãú İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó</div><br>  (They are the dwellers of the Fire, therein they will abide.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Parable of What the Disbelievers Spend in This Life</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah gave a parable for what the disbelievers spend in this life, as Mujahid, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi said.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóËóáõ ãóÇ íõäúİöŞõæäó İöì åöÜĞöåö ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ßóãóËóáö ÑöíÍò İöíåóÇ ÕöÑøñ</div><br>  (The likeness of what they spend in this world is the likeness of a wind of Sir;) a frigid wind, as Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and others have said. `Ata' said that Sir, means, `cold and snow.' Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid are also reported to have said that Sir means, `fire'. This latter meaning does not contradict the meanings we mentioned above, because extreme cold weather, especially when accompanied by snow, burns plants and produce, and has the same effect fire has on such growth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÕóÇÈóÊú ÍóÑúËó Şóæúãò ÙóáóãõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóåõãú İóÃóåúáóßóÊúåõ</div><br>  (It struck the harvest of a people who did wrong against themselves and destroyed it) 3:117, by burning. This Ayah mentions a calamity that strikes produce that is ready to harvest, destroying it by burning and depriving its owner of it when he needs it the most. Such is the case with the disbelievers, for Allah destroys the rewards for their good deeds in this life, just as He destroyed the produce of the sinner because of his sins. Both types did not build their work on firm foundations,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ Ùóáóãóåõãõ Çááøóåõ æóáóÜßöäú ÃóäİõÓóåõãú íóÙúáöãõæäó</div><br>  (And Allah wronged them not, but they wronged themselves.)  </div></body></html>
