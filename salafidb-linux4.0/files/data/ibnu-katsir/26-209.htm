Thus have We caused it to enter the hearts of the criminals.) (201. They will not believe in it until they see the painful torment.) (202. It shall come to them of a sudden, while they perceive it not.) (203. Then they will say: "Can we be respited'') (204. Would they then wish for Our torment to be hastened on) (205.

And never did We destroy a township but it had its warners) (209. By way of reminder, and We have never been unjust.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Deniers will never believe until They see the Torment</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says: `thus We caused denial, disbelief, rejection and stubbornness to enter the hearts of the sinners.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó Èöåö</div><br>  (They will not believe in it), i.e., the truth,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì íóÑóæõÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó ÇáÇøñáöíãó</div><br>  (until they see the painful torment.) means, when their excuses will be of no avail, and the curse will be upon them, and theirs will be an evil abode.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíóÃúÊöíóåõã ÈóÛúÊóÉğ</div><br>  (It shall come to them of a sudden,) means, the punishment of Allah will come upon them suddenly,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú áÇó íóÔúÚõÑõæäóİóíóŞõæáõæÇú åóáú äóÍúäõ ãõäÙóÑõæäó </div><br>  (while they perceive it not. Then they will say: "Can we be respited'') means, when they see the punishment, then they will wish they had a little more time so that they can obey Allah -- or so they claim. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäĞöÑö ÇáäøóÇÓó íóæúãó íóÃúÊöíåöãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ</div><br>  (And warn mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them) until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ áóßõãú ãøöä ÒóæóÇáò</div><br>  (that you would not leave) (14: 44). When every sinner and evildoer sees his punishment, he will feel intense regret. Such was the case of Fir`awn, when Musa prayed against him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÂ Åöäøóßó ÁÇÊóíúÊó İöÑúÚóæúäó æóãóáÇøåõ ÒöíäóÉğ æóÃóãúæóÇáÇğ İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ</div><br>  (Our Lord!

(10:88-89). This supplication had an effect on Fir`awn: he did not believe until he saw the painful torment:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÂ ÃóÏúÑóßóåõ ÇáúÛóÑóŞõ ŞóÇáó ÁóÇãóäÊõ Ãóäøóåõ áÇ ÅöáöÜåó ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöì ÁóÇãóäóÊú Èöåö ÈóäæÇú ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó</div><br>  (till when drowning overtook him, he said: "I believe that none has the right to be worshipped but He in Whom the Children of Israel believe.'') until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõäÊó ãöäó ÇáúãõİúÓöÏöíäó</div><br>  (and you were one of the mischief-makers) (10:90-91). And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÃóæúÇú ÈóÃúÓóäóÇ ŞóÇáõæÇú ÁóÇãóäøóÇ ÈöÇááøóåö æóÍúÏóåõ</div><br>  (so when they saw Our punishment, they said: "We believe in Allah Alone...'') (40:84-85).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÈöÚóĞóÇÈöäóÇ íóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõæäó </div><br>  (Would they then wish for Our torment to be hastened on) This is a denunciation and a threat, because they used to say to the Messenger, by way of denial, thinking it unlikely ever to happen:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÆúÊöäóÇ ÈöÚóĞóÇÈö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Bring Allah's torment upon us) (29:29). This is as Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõæäóßó ÈöÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö</div><br>  (And they ask you to hasten on the torment...) (29:53-55).

Then Allah tells us of His justice towards His creation, in that He does not destroy any nation until after He has left them with no excuse, by warning them, sending Messengers to them and establishing proof against them. He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóåúáóßúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÑúíóÉò ÅöáÇøó áóåóÇ ãõäĞöÑõæäó </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ĞößúÑóì æóãóÇ ßõäøóÇ ÙóÜáöãöíäó </div><br>  (And never did We destroy a township but it had its warners by way of reminder, and We have never been unjust.)
