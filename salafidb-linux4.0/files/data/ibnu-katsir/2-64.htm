Allah stated that when He took their pledge from them, He raised the mountain above their heads, so that they affirm the pledge that they gave Allah and abide by it with sincerity and seriousness. Hence, Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞ äóÊóŞúäóÇ ÇáúÌóÈóáó İóæúŞóåõãú ßóÃóäøóåõ ÙõáøóÉñ æóÙóäøõæÇú Ãóäøóåõ æóÇŞöÚñ Èöåöãú ÎõĞõæÇú ãóÂ ÁóÇÊóíúäóÇßõã ÈöŞõæøóÉò æóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú ãóÇ İöíåö áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÊøóŞõæäó </div><br>  (And (remember) when We raised the mountain over them as if it had been a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall on them. (We said): "Hold firmly to what We have given you (Tawrah), and remember that which is therein (act on its commandments), so that you may fear Allah and obey Him.'') (7:171).  The mount mentioned here is At-Tur, just as it was explained in Surat Al-A`raf, according to the Tafsir of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ata', `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and others. This is more obvious. There is another report from Ibn `Abbas saying; `The Tur is a type of mountain that vegetation grows on, if no vegetation grows on it, it is not called Tur.' And in the Hadith about the trials, Ibn `Abbas said; "When they (the Jews) refused to obey, Allah raised the mountain above their heads so that they would listen.''  Al-Hasan said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎõĞõæÇú ãóÂ ÁóÇÊóíúäóÜßõã ÈöŞõæøóÉò</div><br>  (Hold fast to that which We have given you) means, the Tawrah. Mujahid said that the Ayah commanded, "Strictly adhere to it.'' Abu Al-`Aliyah and Ar-Rabi` said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇĞúßõÑõæÇú ãóÇ İöíåö</div><br>  (and remember that which is therein) means, "Read the Tawrah and implement it.''
