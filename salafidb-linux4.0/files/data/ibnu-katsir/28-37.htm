Fir`awn and his chiefs saw that with their own eyes and realized that it was certainly from Allah, but because of their disbelief and sin they resorted to stubbornness and false arguments. This was because they were too evil and arrogant to follow the truth. They said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ åóÜĞóÂ ÅöáÇøó ÓöÍúÑñ ãøõİúÊóÑğì</div><br>  (This is nothing but invented magic.) meaning, fabricated and made up.

They were referring worshipping Allah Alone, with no partner or associate. They said: "We have never seen anyone among our forefathers following this religion; we have only ever seen people associating other gods in worship with Allah.
