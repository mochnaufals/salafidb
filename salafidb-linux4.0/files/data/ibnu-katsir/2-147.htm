Those to whom We gave the Scripture (Jews and Christians) recognise him (Muhammad or the Ka`bah at Makkah) as they recognize their sons. But verily, a party of them conceal the truth while they know it Ü i.e., the qualities of Muhammad which are written in the Tawrah and the Injil ). (147. This is) the truth from your Lord.

Similarly, in a Hadith, Allah's Messenger said to a man who had a youngster with him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÈúäõßó åóĞóÇ»</div><br>  ¿ ŞóÇáó: äóÚóãú íóÇ ÑóÓõæáó Çááåö ÃóÔúåóÏõ Èöåö  (Is this your son) He said, "Yes, O Messenger of Allah! I testify to this fact.'' Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãóÇ Åöäøóåõ áóÇ íóÌúäöí Úóáóíúßó æóáóÇ ÊóÌúäöí Úóáóíúå»</div><br>  (Well, you would not transgress against him nor would he transgress against you.)  According to Al-Qurtubi, it was narrated that `Umar said to `Abdullah bin Salam (an Israelite scholar who became a Muslim), "Do you recognize Muhammad as you recognize your own son'' He replied, "Yes, and even more. The Honest One descended from heaven on the Honest One on the earth with his (i.e., Muhammad's) description and I recognized him, although I do not know anything about his mother's story.''  Allah states next that although they had knowledge and certainty in the Prophet , they still:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíóßúÊõãõæäó ÇáúÍóŞøó</div><br>  (conceal the truth.)  The Ayah indicates that they hide the truth from the people, about the Prophet , that they find in their Books,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (while they know it. ) Allah then strengthens the resolve of His Prophet and the believers and affirms that what the Prophet came with is the truth without doubt, saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúÍóŞøõ ãöä ÑøóÈøößó İóáÇó Êóßõæäóäøó ãöäó ÇáúãõãúÊóÑöíäó </div><br>  ((This is) the truth from your Lord.
