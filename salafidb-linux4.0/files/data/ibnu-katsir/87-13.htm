Ibn Jarir recorded from Ibn Ishaq Al-Hamdani that whenever Ibn `Abbas would recite   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÈøöÍö ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøößó ÇáÇøÚúáóì </div><br>  (Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.) he would say, "Glory to my Lord, the Most High,'' and whenever he would recite   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÃõŞúÓöãõ Èöíóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö </div><br>  (I swear by the Day of Resurrection.)

Qatadah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóÈøöÍö ÇÓúãó ÑóÈøößó ÇáÇøÚúáóì </div><br>  (Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.) "It has been mentioned to us that whenever the Prophet of Allah used to recite it he would say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓõÈúÍóÇäó ÑóÈøöíó ÇáúÃóÚúáóì»</div><br>  (Glory to my Lord, the Most High.)'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Creation, the Decree, and the bringing forth of Vegetation</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó İóÓóæøóì </div><br>  (Who has created, and then proportioned it.) meaning, He created that which has been created, and He fashioned every creation in the best of forms. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöì ŞóÏøóÑó İóåóÏóì </div><br>  (And Who has measured; and then guided.) Mujahid said, "He guided man to distress and happiness, and he guided the cattle to their pastures.'' This Ayah is similar to what Allah has said about Musa's statement to Fir`awn,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøõäóÇ ÇáøóĞöì ÃóÚúØóì ßõáøó ÔóìÁò ÎóáúŞóåõ Ëõãøó åóÏóì</div><br>  (Our Lord is He Who gave to each thing its form and nature, then guided it aright.) (20:50) meaning, He decreed a set measure and guided the creation to it. This is just as is confirmed in Sahih Muslim on the authority of `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ŞóÏøóÑó ãóŞóÇÏöíÑó ÇáúÎóáóÇÆöŞö ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú íóÎúáõŞó ÇáÓøóãóæÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖó ÈöÎóãúÓöíäó Ãóáúİó ÓóäóÉò æóßóÇäó ÚóÑúÔõåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÇÁ»</div><br>  (Verily, Allah ordained the measure of all creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and His Throne was over the water.) Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöì ÃóÎúÑóÌó ÇáúãóÑúÚóì </div><br>  (And Who brings out the pasturage,) meaning, all types of vegetation and crops.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÌóÚóáóåõ ÛõËóÂÁğ ÃóÍúæóì </div><br>  (And then makes it dark stubble.) Ibn `Abbas said, "Dried up and altered.'' It has been narrated that Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd, all made similar statements. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Prophet does not forget the Revelation</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóäõŞúÑöÆõßó</div><br>  (We shall make you to recite,) meaning, `O Muhammad.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóäÓóì</div><br>  (so you shall not forget (it),) This is Allah informing and promising him (the Prophet ) that He will teach him a recitation that he will not forget.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ÔóÂÁó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (Except what Allah may will.) Qatadah said, "The Prophet did not forget anything except what Allah willed.'' It has been said that the meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÊóäÓóì</div><br>  (so you shall not forget,) is, "do not forget'' and that which would be abrogated, is merely an exception to this. Meaning, `do not forget what We teach you to recite, except what Allah wills, which He removes and there is no sin on your leaving it off (not retaining it).' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ íóÚúáóãõ ÇáúÌóåúÑó æóãóÇ íóÎúİóì</div><br>  (He knows what is apparent and what is hidden.) meaning, He knows what the creatures do openly and what they hide, whether it be statements or deeds. None of that is hidden from Him. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäõíóÓøöÑõßó áöáúíõÓúÑóì </div><br>  (And We shall make easy for you the easy.) meaning, `We will make good deeds and statements easy for you, and We will legislate such Law for you that is easy, tolerant, straight and just, with no crookedness, difficulty or hardship in it.' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to remind</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞóßøöÑú Åöä äøóİóÚóÊö ÇáĞøößúÑóì </div><br>  (Therefore remind in case the reminder profits.) meaning, remind where reminding is beneficial. From here we get the etiquette of spreading knowledge, that it should not be wasted upon those who are not suitable or worthy of it. The Commander of the believers, `Ali said, "You do not tell people any statement that their intellects do not grasp except that it will be a Fitnah (trial) for some of them.'' He also said, "Tell people that which they know. Would you like for Allah and His Messenger to be rejected'' Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóíóĞøóßøóÑõ ãóä íóÎúÔóì </div><br>  (The reminder will be received by him who fears,) meaning, `he whose heart fears Allah and who knows that he is going to meet Him, will receive admonition from what you convey to him, O Muhammad.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÊóÌóäøóÈõåóÇ ÇáÇøñÔúŞóì - ÇáøóĞöì íóÕúáóì ÇáäøóÇÑó ÇáúßõÈúÑóì - Ëõãøó áÇó íóãõæÊõ İöíåóÇ æóáÇó íóÍúíóÇ </div><br>  (But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die nor live.) meaning, he will not die and thus be allowed to rest, nor will he live a life that is beneficial to him. Instead, his life will be harmful to him, because it will be the cause of his feeling of the pain of torment and various types of punishments what he is being punished with.  Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãøóÇ Ãóåúáõ ÇáäøóÇÑö ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú ÃóåúáõåóÇ áóÇ íóãõæÊõæäó æóáóÇ íóÍúíóæúäó¡ æóÃóãøóÇ ÃõäóÇÓñ íõÑöíÏõ Çááåõ Èöåöãõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÉó İóíõãöíÊõåõãú İöí ÇáäøóÇÑö İóíóÏúÎõáõ Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáÔøõİóÚóÇÁõ İóíóÃúÎõĞõ ÇáÑøóÌõáõ ÇáÖøöÈóÇÑóÉó İóíõäúÈöÊõåõãú Ãæ ŞÇá: íóäúÈõÊõæäó İöí äóåúÑö ÇáúÍóíóÇ¡ Ãæ ŞÇá: ÇáúÍóíóÇÉö¡ Ãæ ŞÇá: ÇáúÍóíóæóÇäö Ãæ ŞÇá: äóåúÑö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö İóíóäúÈõÊõæäó äóÈóÇÊó ÇáúÍöÈøóÉö İöí Íóãöíáö ÇáÓøóíúá»</div><br>  (Concerning the people of the Fire who are deserving of it, they will not die nor will they live. Regarding the people that Allah wants mercy for, He will cause them to die in the Fire. Then He will allow the intercessors to come to them, and a man will take his groups of supporters and plant them (or he said (they will be planted) in the River of Al-Haya (or he said (Al-Hayah, or Al-Hayawan, or Nahr Al-Jannah). Then they will sprout up like the sprouting of the seed on the moist bank of a flowing stream.) Then the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãóÇ ÊóÑóæúäó ÇáÔøóÌóÑóÉó Êóßõæäõ ÎóÖúÑóÇÁó¡ Ëõãøó Êóßõæäõ ÕóİúÑóÇÁó¡ Ëõãøó Êóßõæäõ ÎóÖúÑóÇÁó¿»</div><br>  (Haven't you all seen the tree that is green, then it turns yellow, then it turns green (again)) Abu Sa`id then said that some of those present said, "It is as if the Prophet used to live in the desert wilderness (i.e., due to his parables of nature).'' Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa`id that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãøóÇ Ãóåúáõ ÇáäøóÇÑö ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú ÃóåúáõåóÇ İóÅöäøóåõãú áóÇ íóãõæÊõæäó İöíåóÇ æóáóÇ íóÍúíóæúäó¡ æóáóÜÜßöäú ÃõäóÇÓñ Ãæ ßãÇ ŞÇá ÊõÕöíÈõåõãõ ÇáäøóÇÑõ ÈöĞõäõæÈöåöãú Ãæ ŞÇá: ÈöÎóØóÇíóÇåõãú İóíõãöíÊõåõãú ÅöãóÇÊóÉğ ÍóÊúì ÅöĞóÇ ÕóÇÑõæÇ İóÍúãğÇ ÃõĞöäó İöí ÇáÔøóİóÇÚóÉö¡ İóÌöíÁó Èöåöãú ÖóÈóÇÆöÑó ÖóÈóÇÆöÑó İóÈõËøõæÇ Úóáì ÃóäúåóÇÑö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö İóíõŞóÇáõ:íóÇ Ãóåúáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÃóİöíÖõæÇ Úóáóíúåöãú¡ İóíóäúÈõÊõæäó äóÈóÇÊó ÇáúÍöÈøóÉö Êóßõæäõ İöí Íóãöíáö ÇáÓøóíúá»</div><br>  (Concerning the people of the Fire who will be dwellers of it, they will not die in it nor will they live. However, there will be a group of people - or as he said -( whom the Fire will burn due to their sins - or he said - (their wrongdoings. So, He will cause them to die until they become burnt coal. Then the intercession will be allowed and they will be brought group after group, and they will be scattered over the rivers of Paradise. Then it will be said: "O people of Paradise! Pour down upon them.'' Then they will sprout like the growing of the seed that is upon the moist bank of the flowing stream.'' Then, a man from among the people present said, "It is as if the Messenger of Allah used to live in the desert wilderness.'' Muslim also recorded this Hadith.  </div></body></html>
