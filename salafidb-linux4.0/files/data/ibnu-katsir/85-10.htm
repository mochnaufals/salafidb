So, when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat there with him; and on visiting the sorcerer the latter would thrash him. So, the boy complained about this to the monk.

So the boy carried on like that (for some time). Then a huge terrible creature appeared on the road and the people were unable to pass by.

Then he said to the king, "You will not be able to kill me until you do as I order you. And if you do as I order you, you will be able to kill me.'' The king asked, "And what is that'' The boy said, "Gather the people in one elevated place and tie me to the trunk of a tree; then take an arrow from my quiver and say: `In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.' If you do this, you will be able to kill me.'' So he did this, and placing an arrow in the bow, he shot it, saying, "In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.'' The arrow hit the boy in the temple, and the boy placed his hand over the arrow wound and died. The people proclaimed, "We believe in the Lord of the boy!'' Then it was said to the king, "Do you see what has happened That which you feared has taken place. By Allah, all the people have believed (in the Lord of the boy).'' So he ordered that ditches be dug at the entrances to the roads and it was done, and fires were kindled in them. Then the king said, "Whoever abandons his religion, let him go, and whoever does not, throw him into the fire.'' They were struggling and scuffling in the fire, until a woman and her baby whom she was breast feeding came and it was as if she was being somewhat hesitant of falling into the fire, so her baby said to her, "Be patient mother! For verily, you are following the truth!'') Muslim also recorded this Hadith at the end of the Sahih. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar related this story in his book of Sirah in another way that has some differences from that which has just been related. Then, after Ibn Ishaq explained that the people of Najran began following the religion of the boy after his murder, which was the religion of Christianity, he said, "Then (the king) Dhu Nuwas came to them with his army and called them to Judaism. He gave them a choice to either accept Judaism or be killed, so they chose death. Thus, he had a ditch dug and burned (some of them) in the fire (in the ditch), while others he killed with the sword. He made an example of them (by slaughtering them) until he had killed almost twenty thousand of them. It was about Dhu Nuwas and his army that Allah revealed to His Messenger :   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞõÊöáó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáÇøòÎúÏõæÏö - ÇáäøóÇÑö ĞóÇÊö ÇáúæóŞõæÏö - ÅöĞú åõãú ÚóáóíúåóÇ ŞõÚõæÏñ - æóåõãú Úóáóì ãóÇ íóİúÚóáõæäó ÈöÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÔõåõæÏñ - æóãóÇ äóŞóãõæÇú ãöäúåõãú ÅöáÇøó Ãóä íõÄúãöäõæÇú ÈöÇááøóåö ÇáúÚóÒöíÒö ÇáúÍóãöíÏö - ÇáøóĞöì áóåõ ãõáúßõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÇááøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ÔóåöíÏñ </div><br>  (Cursed were the People of the Ditch. Of fire fed with fuel. When they sat by it. And they witnessed what they were doing against the believers. And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise! To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And Allah is Witness over everything.) (85:4-9)'' This is what Muhammad bin Ishaq said in his book of Sirah -- that the one who killed the People of the Ditch was Dhu Nuwas, and his name was Zur`ah. In the time of his kingdom he was called Yusuf. He was the son of Tuban As`ad Abi Karib, who was the Tubba` who invaded Al-Madinah and put the covering over the Ka`bah. He kept two rabbis with him from the Jews of Al-Madinah. After this some of the people of Yemen accepted Judaism at the hands of these two rabbis, as Ibn Ishaq mentions at length. So Dhu Nuwas killed twenty thousand people in one morning in the Ditch. Only one man among them escaped. He was known as Daws Dhu Tha`laban. He escaped on a horse and they set out after him, but they were unable to catch him. He went to Caesar, the emperor of Ash-Sham. So, Caesar wrote to An-Najashi, the King of Abyssinia. So, he sent with him an army of Abyssinian Christians, who were lead by Aryat and Abrahah. They rescued Yemen from the hands of the Jews. Dhu Nuwas tried to flee but eventually fell into the sea and drowned. After this, the kingdom of Abyssinia remained under Christian power for seventy years. Then the power was divested from the Christians by Sayf bin Dhi Yazin Al-Himyari when Kisra, the king of Persia sent an army there (to Yemen). He (the king) sent with him (Sayf Al-Himyari) those people who were in the prisons, and they were close to seven hundred in number. So, he (Sayf Al-Himyari) conquered Yemen with them and returned the kingdom back to the people of Himyar (Yemenis). We will mention a portion of this -- if Allah wills -- when we discuss the Tafsir of the Surah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑó ßóíúİó İóÚóáó ÑóÈøõßó ÈöÃóÕúÍóÜÈö Çáúİöíáö </div><br>  (Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the Owners of the Elephant) (105:1) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Punishment of the People of the Ditch</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó İóÊóäõæÇú ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó æóÇáúãõÄúãöäóÜÊö</div><br>  (Verily, those who put into trial the believing men and believing women,) meaning, they burned (them).

This is because the recompense is based upon the type of deed performed. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "Look at this generosity and kindness. These people killed Allah's Awliya' and He still invites them to make repentance and seek forgiveness.''  </div></body></html>
