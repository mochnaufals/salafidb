The Ayah means: remember that Day and its terrors, and the great honor and high position that Allah has bestowed upon you. This Ayah is like the Ayah with which `Abdullah bin Mas`ud ended when he recited to the Messenger of Allah from the beginning of Surat An-Nisa'. When he reached the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóßóíúİó ÅöĞóÇ ÌöÆúäóÇ ãöä ßõáøö ÃãøóÉò ÈöÔóåöíÏò æóÌöÆúäóÇ Èößó Úóáóì åóÜÄõáÇÁö ÔóåöíÏÇğ </div><br>  (How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these) 4:41 the Messenger of Allah said to him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÍóÓúÈõß»</div><br>  (Enough.)

The Qur'an contains all kinds of beneficial knowledge, such as reports of what happened in the past, information about what is yet to come, what is lawful and unlawful, and what people need to know about their worldly affairs, their religion, their livelihood in this world, and their destiny in the Hereafter.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóÏóì</div><br>  (a guidance) means, for their hearts.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑóÍúãóÉğ æóÈõÔúÑóì áöáúãõÓúáöãöíäó</div><br>  (a mercy, and good news for the Muslims.)

This is one of the opinions, and it presents a good understanding of it.  </div></body></html>
