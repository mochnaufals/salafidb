So Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÑóì ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ÈóÇÑöÒóÉğ</div><br>  (and you will see the earth as a levelled plain, ) meaning clear and open, with no features that anyone may recognize and nothing for anyone to hide behind.

He will overlook and forgive and have mercy, and He will punish whomever He wills by His power, wisdom and justice. He will fill Hell with the disbelievers and those who have been disobedient. Then He will rescue the disobedient, and leave the disbelievers there for eternity. He is the Judge Who never wrongs or oppresses.

Until His saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÜÓöÈöíäó</div><br>  (to take account) 21:47 And there are many similar Ayat.

I said to the doorkeeper, `Tell him that Jabir is at the door.' He said, `Jabir bin `Abdullah' I said, `Yes.' So he came out, still putting his garment on, and embraced me, and I embraced him, and said: `I heard a Hadith narrated by you, that you heard from the Messenger of Allah about reciprocal punishments. I was afraid that you or I would die before I could hear it.' He said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÍúÔõÑõ Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó ÇáäøóÇÓó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö Ãóæú ŞóÇáó: ÇáúÚöÈóÇÏó ÚõÑóÇÉğ ÛõÑúáğÇ ÈõåúãğÇ»</div><br>  (Allah will gather the people -- or His servants -- on the Day of Resurrection, naked, uncircumcised and Buhman.)
