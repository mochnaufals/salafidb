Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøõÈóãóÇ íóæóÏøõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (How much would those who disbelieved wish) Here Allah tells us that they will regret having lived in disbelief, and will wish that they had been Muslims in this world. Regarding Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøõÈóãóÇ íóæóÏøõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú áóæú ßóÇäõæÇú ãõÓúáöãöíäó </div><br>  (How much would those who disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Abi Az-Za`ra', from `Abdullah, who said: "This is about the Jahannamiyyun (the sinners among the believers who will stay in Hell for some time), when they the disbelievers see them being brought out of Hell.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøõÈóãóÇ íóæóÏøõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú áóæú ßóÇäõæÇú ãõÓúáöãöíäó </div><br>  (How much would those who disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims.) Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn `Abbas and Anas bin Malik explained that this Ayah refers to the Day when Allah will detain the sinful Muslims in Hell along with the idolators. He said: "The idolators will say to them, `What you used to worship on earth has not helped you.' Then by virtue of His mercy, Allah will be angry for their sake, and He will remove them from it. That is when   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøõÈóãóÇ íóæóÏøõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú áóæú ßóÇäõæÇú ãõÓúáöãöíäó </div><br>  (How much would those who disbelieved wish that they had been Muslims).''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ĞóÑúåõãú íóÃúßõáõæÇú æóíóÊóãóÊøóÚõæÇú</div><br>  (Leave them to eat and enjoy) this is a stern and definitive threat for them, like His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÊóãóÊøóÚõæÇú İóÅöäøó ãóÕöíÑóßõãú Åöáóì ÇáäøóÇÑö</div><br>  (Say: "Enjoy your brief life!

Eat and enjoy yourselves (in this worldly life) for a little while. Verily, you are the guilty.)77:46 Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõáúåöåöãõ ÇáÇøñãóáõ</div><br>  (let them be preoccupied with false hope.) i.e., distracted from repentance and turning to Allah, for   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓóæúİó íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (They will soon come to know!) that is, their punishment.  </div></body></html>
