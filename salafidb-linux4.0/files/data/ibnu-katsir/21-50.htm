He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÁóÇÊóíúäóÇ ãõæÓóì æóåóÜÑõæäó ÇáúİõÑúŞóÇäó</div><br>  (And indeed We granted to Musa and Harun the criterion) Mujahid said, "This means the Scripture.'' Abu Salih said: "The Tawrah.'' Qatadah said: "The Tawrah, what it permits and it forbids, and how Allah differentiated between truth and falsehood.'' In conclusion, we may say that the heavenly Books included the distinction between truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, transgression and the right way, lawful and unlawful, and that which will fill the heart with light, guidance, fear of Allah and repentance. So Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúİõÑúŞóÇäó æóÖöíóÂÁğ æóĞößúÑÇğ áøöáúãõÊøóŞöíäó</div><br>  (the criterion, and a shining light and a Reminder for those who have Taqwa.) meaning, a reminder and exhortation for them. Then He describes them as:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÎúÔóæúäó ÑóÈøóåõã ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö</div><br>  (Those who fear their Lord in the unseen.) This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóäú ÎóÔöìó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäó ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö æóÌóÂÁó ÈöŞóáúÈò ãøõäöíÈò </div><br>  (Who feared the Most Gracious in the unseen and came with a repenting heart. ) 50:33   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÎúÔóæúäó ÑóÈøóåõã ÈöÇáúÛóíúÈö áóåõã ãøóÛúİöÑóÉñ æóÃóÌúÑñ ßóÈöíÑñ </div><br>  (Verily, those who fear their Lord unseen, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.) 67:12 t   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú ãøöäó ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ãõÔúİöŞõæäó</div><br>  (and they are afraid of the Hour.) means, they fear it. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóÜĞóÇ ĞößúÑñ ãøõÈóÇÑóßñ ÃóäÒóáúäóÜåõ</div><br>  (And this is a blessed Reminder which We have sent down;) means, the Magnificent Qur'an, which falsehood cannot approach, from before it or behind it, revealed by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóÃóäúÊõãú áóåõ ãõäßöÑõæäó</div><br>  (will you then deny it) means, will you deny it when it is the utmost in clarity and truth  </div></body></html>
