Truly, the Record of the wicked is in Sijjin.) meaning, that their final destination and their abode will be in Sijjin, which is derived from the word prison (Sijn), and here it means straitened circumstances. Thus, Allah expresses the greatness of this matter, saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÏúÑóÇßó ãóÇ ÓöÌøöíäñ </div><br>  (And what will make you know what Sijjin is) meaning, it is a great matter, an eternal prison, and a painful torment. Some have said that it is beneath the seventh earth. It has been mentioned previously in the lengthy Hadith of Al-Bara' bin `Azib that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóŞõæá Çááåõ ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó İöí ÑõæÍö ÇáúßóÇİöÑö ÇßúÊõÈõæÇ ßöÊóÇÈóåõ İöí ÓöÌøöíäò. æóÓöÌøöíäñ åöíó ÊóÍúÊõ ÇáúÃóÑúÖö ÇáÓøóÇÈöÚóÉ»</div><br>  (Allah says concerning the soul of the disbeliever, `Record his book in Sijjin.' And Sijjin is beneath the seventh earth.)'' it is known that the destination of the wicked people will be Hell, and it is the lowest of the low. For Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÑóÏóÏúäóÜåõ ÃóÓúİóáó ÓóÜİöáöíäó ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö</div><br>  (Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low.

(25:13) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßöÊóÜÈñ ãøóÑúŞõæãñ </div><br>  (A Register inscribed.) This is not an explanation of His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÏúÑóÇßó ãóÇ ÓöÌøöíäñ </div><br>  (And what will make you know what Sijjin is) It is only an explanation of the destination that will be recorded for them, which is Sijjin. Meaning, it is inscribed, written, and completed. No one can add to it and no one can remove anything from it. This was said by Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. Then Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíúáñ íóæúãóÆöĞò áøöáúãõßóĞøöÈöíäó </div><br>  (Woe, that Day, to those who deny.) meaning, when they come to the imprisonment, Allah threatened them with, on the Day of Judgement, and the disgraceful torment. The statement, "Woe,'' has already been discussed previously and there is no need to repeat it here. Basically, it means destruction and devastation. This is like what is said, "Woe to so-and-so.'' This is similar to what has been recorded in the Musnad and the Sunan collections on the authority of Bahz bin Hakim bin Mu`awiyah bin Haydah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ó ãóÇ ÓöÌøöíäñ </div><br>  (Nay!

(25:13) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßöÊóÜÈñ ãøóÑúŞõæãñ </div><br>  (A Register inscribed.)

Then Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíúáñ íóæúãóÆöĞò áøöáúãõßóĞøöÈöíäó </div><br>  (Woe, that Day, to those who deny.) meaning, when they come to the imprisonment, Allah threatened them with, on the Day of Judgement, and the disgraceful torment. The statement, "Woe,'' has already been discussed previously and there is no need to repeat it here. Basically, it means destruction and devastation. This is like what is said, "Woe to so-and-so.'' This is similar to what has been recorded in the Musnad and the Sunan collections on the authority of Bahz bin Hakim bin Mu`awiyah bin Haydah, who reported from his father, who reported from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóíúáñ áöáøóĞöí íõÍóÏøöËõ İóíóßúĞöÈõ áöíõÖúÍößó ÇáäøóÇÓó¡ æóíúáñ áóåõ æóíúáñ áóå»</div><br>  (Woe unto whoever speaks, and lies in order to make the people laugh. Woe unto him, woe unto him.) Then Allah says, in explaining who are the wicked, disbelieving deniers,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íõßóĞøöÈõæäó Èöíóæúãö ÇáÏøöíäö </div><br>  (Those who deny the Day of Recompense.) meaning, they do not believe it will happen, and they do not believe in its existence. Thus, they consider it a matter that is farfetched. Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íõßóĞøöÈõ Èöåö ÅöáÇøó ßõáøõ ãõÚúÊóÏò ÃóËöíãò </div><br>  (And none can deny it except every transgressor, sinner.) meaning, transgressive in his actions by doing that which is forbidden and exceeding the limits when acquiring the permissible. He is a sinner in his statements, because he lies whenever he speaks, he breaks his promises whenever he makes them, and he behaves in an abusive and wicked manner whenever he argues. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞóÇ ÊõÊúáóì Úóáóíúåö ÁóÇíóÜÊõäóÇ ŞóÇáó ÃóÓóÜØöíÑõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó </div><br>  (When Our Ayat are recited to him, he says: "Tales of the ancients!'') meaning, whenever he hears the Words of Allah from the Messenger , he denies it and has ill thoughts about it. Thus, he believes that it is a collection gathered from the books of the ancients. This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ Şöíáó áóåõãú ãøóÇĞóÂ ÃóäÒóáó ÑóÈøõßõãú ŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóÓóÜØöíÑõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó </div><br>  (And when it is said to them: "What is it that your Lord has sent down'' They say: "Tales of the men of old!'') (16:24) Similarly Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóÓóÜØöíÑõ ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó ÇßúÊóÊóÈóåóÇ İóåöìó Êõãúáóì Úóáóíúåö ÈõßúÑóÉğ æóÃóÕöíáÇğ </div><br>  (And they say: "Tales of the ancients, which he has written down: and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.'')

But on their hearts is the Ran (covering) which they used to earn.) meaning, the matter is not as they claim, nor as they say: "Verily, this Qur'an is tales of the ancients.'' Rather, it is the Word of Allah, His inspiration and His revelation to His Messenger . The only thing that blocked their hearts from believing in it is the dark covering cast over it from the many sins and wrong they committed that has covered up their hearts. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó Èóáú ÑóÇäó Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú ãøóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóßúÓöÈõæäó </div><br>  (Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (covering) which they used to earn.) This dark covering known as Rayn overcomes the hearts of the disbelievers, the covering of Ghaym is for the righteous, and the covering of Ghayn is for those who are near to Allah. Ibn Jarir, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nisa'i, and Ibn Majah all recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáúÚóÈúÏó ÅöĞóÇ ÃóĞúäóÈó ĞóäúÈğÇ ßóÇäóÊú äõßúÊóÉñ ÓóæúÏóÇÁõ İöí ŞóáúÈöåö¡ İóÅöäú ÊóÇÈó ãöäúåóÇ ÕõŞöáó ŞóáúÈõåõ¡ Şu</div><br>  uA ay!

Rather, it is the Word of Allah, His inspiration and His revelation to His Messenger . The only thing that blocked their hearts from believing in it is the dark covering cast over it from the many sins and wrong they committed that has covered up their hearts. Thus, Allah says, uuA ? "What is it that your Lord has sent down'' They say: "Tales of the men of old!'')
