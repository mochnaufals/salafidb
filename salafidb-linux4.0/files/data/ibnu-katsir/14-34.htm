He also sends down rain from the sky and, in its aftermath brings forth a variety of vegetation, fruits and plants of different colors, shapes, tastes, scents and uses. Allah also made the ships sail on the surface of the water by His command and He made the sea able to carry these ships in order that travelers can transfer from one area to another to transport goods. Allah also created the rivers that flow through the earth from one area to another as provision for the servants which they use to drink and irrigate, and for other benefits,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÎøóÑ áóßõãõ ÇáÔøóãúÓó æóÇáúŞóãóÑó ÏóÂÆöÈóíäó</div><br>  (And He has made the sun and the moon, both constantly pursuing their courses), rotating by night and by day,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÇáÔøóãúÓõ íóäÈóÛöì áóåóÂ Ãóä ÊÏúÑößó ÇáŞóãóÑó æóáÇó Çáøóíúáõ ÓóÇÈöŞõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑö æóßõáøñ İöì İóáóßò íóÓúÈóÍõæäó </div><br>  (It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day.

Allah states that the servants are never able to count His blessings, let alone thank Him duly for them.

All praise is due to You, without being able to sufficiently thank You, nor ever wish to be cutoff from You, nor ever feeling rich from relying on You; our Lord!) It was reported that Prophet Dawud, peace be upon him, used to say in his supplication, "O Lord! How can I ever duly thank You, when my thanking You is also a favor from You to me'' Allah the Exalted answered him, "Now, you have thanked Me sufficiently, O Dawud,'' meaning, `when you admitted that you will never be able to duly thank Me.'  </div></body></html>
