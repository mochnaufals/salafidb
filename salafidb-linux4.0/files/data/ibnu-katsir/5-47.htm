Allah states in another Ayah that `Isa said to the Children of Israel,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇøñÍöáøó áóßõã ÈóÚúÖó ÇáøóĞöí ÍõÑøöãó Úóáóíúßõãú</div><br>  (. ..and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you.) So the scholars say that the Injil abrogated some of the rulings of the Tawrah. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõÏğì æóãóæúÚöÙóÉñ áøöáúãõÊøóŞöíäó</div><br>  (a guidance and an admonition for those who have Taqwa.) means, We made the Injil guidance and an admonition that prohibits committing sins and errors, for those who have Taqwa of Allah and fear His warning and torment. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáúíóÍúßõãú Ãóåúáõ ÇáÅöäÌöíáö ÈöãóÂ ÃóäÒóáó Çááøóåõ İöíåö</div><br>  (Let the people of the Injil judge by what Allah has revealed therein.) meaning, so that He judges the people of the Injil by it in their time. Or, the Ayah means, so that they believe in all that is in it and adhere to all its commands, including the good news about the coming of Muhammad and the command to believe in and follow him when he is sent. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íóÜÃóåúáó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö áóÓúÊõãú Úóáóì ÔóìúÁò ÍóÊøóì ÊõŞöíãõæÇú ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉó æóÇáÅöäÌöíáó æóãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúßõãú ãøöä ÑøóÈøößõãú</div><br>  (Say "O People of the Scripture!

We mentioned before that this Ayah was revealed about the Christians, and this is evident from the context of the Ayah.  </div></body></html>
