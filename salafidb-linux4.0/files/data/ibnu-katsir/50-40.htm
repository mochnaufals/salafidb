The statement of Allah the Exalted,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóäóŞøóÈõæÇú İöì ÇáúÈöáóÜÏö åóáú ãöä ãøóÍöíÕò</div><br>  (And they went about the land! Could they find any place of refuge) Ibn `Abbas commented, "They left the traces throughout the land,'' Qatadah said, "They traveled throughout the land seeking provisions through trade and business, more than you have.'' Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú ãöä ãøóÍöíÕò</div><br>  (Could they find any place of refuge) means, `could they find a shelter from Allah's decision and appointed destiny Have what they collected benefited them or averted Allah's torment when it came to them on account of their denial of the Messengers Likewise, you will never be able to avert, avoid, or find refuge or shelter (from His torment).' Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áóĞößúÑóì</div><br>  (Verily, therein is indeed a reminder) and a lesson,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöãóä ßóÇäó áóåõ ŞóáúÈñ</div><br>  (for him who has a heart) meaning, a sound understanding with which he comprehends, or, a good mind, according to Mujahid,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÃóáúŞóì ÇáÓøóãúÚó æóåõæó ÔóåöíÏñ</div><br>  (or gives ear while he is heedful.) meaning, he hears the speech, comprehends and understands it in his mind and grasps its indications with his intellect. Mujahid said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÃóáúŞóì ÇáÓøóãúÚó</div><br>  (or gives ear), means, he does not talk to himself but listens with an attentive heart. Ad-Dahhak commented, "The Arabs would say that someone has given ear when he hears with his ears, while his heart is present and not absent.'' Ath-Thawri and several others said similarly. The statement of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÎóáóŞúäóÇ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó æóãóÇ ÈóíúäóåõãóÇ İöì ÓöÊøóÉö ÃóíøóÇãò æóãóÇ ãóÓøóäóÇ ãöä áøõÛõæÈò </div><br>  (And indeed We created the heavens and the earth and all that between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched Us.) is emphasis on the Resurrection because He Who is able to create the heavens and earth without fatigue, then surely He is able to resurrect the dead. Qatadah said, "The Jews, may Allah's curses descend on them, said that Allah created the heavens and earth in six days and then rested on the seventh day, which was the Sabbath. This is why they call it a holiday. Allah the Exalted then sent down denial of their statement and false opinion.'' Allah said, m   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ãóÓøóäóÇ ãöä áøõÛõæÈò</div><br>  (and nothing of fatigue touched Us.) indicating that no sleep, exhaustion or weariness affects Him. Allah the Exalted the Blessed said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæóáóãú íóÑóæúÇú Ãóäøó Çááøóåó ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóáóãú íóÚúìó ÈöÎóáúŞöåöäøó ÈöŞóÇÏöÑò Úóáóì Ãóä íõÍúìö ÇáúãóæúÊóì Èóáóì Åöäøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ </div><br>  (Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, is able to give life to the dead Yes, He surely is Able to do all things.)(46:33),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÎóáúŞõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÃóßúÜÈóÑõ ãöäú ÎóáúŞö ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind.)(40:57) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÁóäÊõãú ÃóÔóÏøõ ÎóáúŞÇğ Ãóãö ÇáÓøóãóÂÁõ ÈóäóÜåóÇ </div><br>  (Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed)(79:27)  Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÕúÈöÑú Úóáóì ãóÇ íóŞõæáõæäó</div><br>  (So bear with patience all that they say, ) in reference to those who deny the Prophet , ordering him to be patient with them and turn away from them in a good way,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÍóãúÏö ÑóÈøößó ŞóÈúáó ØõáõæÚö ÇáÔøóãúÓö æóŞóÈúáó ÇáúÛõÑõæÈö</div><br>  (and glorify the praises of your Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting.) There were two ordained prayers prior to the Isra' journey. One before the rising of the sun at dawn and the other before sunset in the evening. Qiyam Al-Layl, prayer at night, was a command for the Prophet and his followers for sometime but it was later abrogated for the Ummah. Later, during the Isra' journey, Allah abrogated all of the previous orders for prayer by ordaining five daily prayers, including the prayers of Fajr before sunrise, and `Asr in the late afternoon. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jarir bin `Abdullah said, "When we were sitting with the Prophet , he looked at the full moon and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóãóÇ Åöäøóßõãú ÓóÊõÚúÑóÖõæäó Úóáóì ÑóÈøößõãú İóÊóÑóæúäóåõ ßóãóÇ ÊóÑóæúäó åĞóÇ ÇáúŞóãóÑó áóÇ ÊõÖóÇãøõæäó İöíåö¡ İóÅöäö ÇÓúÊóØóÚúÊõãú Ãóäú áóÇ ÊõÛúáóÈõæÇ Úóáóì ÕóáóÇÉò ŞóÈúáó ØõáõæÚö ÇáÔøóãúÓö æóŞóÈúáó ÛõÑõæÈöåóÇ İóÇİúÚóáõæÇ»</div><br>  (Certainly you will be brought before your Lord and will see Him as you see this moon, and you will have no trouble in seeing Him. So, if you can avoid missing the prayer before the sunrise and the prayer before sunset, you must do so.) He then recited Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÍóãúÏö ÑóÈøößó ŞóÈúáó ØõáõæÚö ÇáÔøóãúÓö æóŞóÈúáó ÇáúÛõÑõæÈö</div><br>  (and glorify the praises of your Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting.)''' The Two Sahihs and the rest of the Group collected this Hadith through the chain of Isma`il. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó Çáøóíúáö İóÓóÈøöÍúåõ</div><br>  (And during a part of the night glorify His praises), meaning pray to Him. Allah said Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó Çáøóíúáö İóÊóåóÌøóÏú Èöåö äóÇİöáóÉğ áøóßó ÚóÓóì Ãóä íóÈúÚóËóßó ÑóÈøõßó ãóŞóÇãÇğ ãøóÍúãõæÏğÇ </div><br>  (And in some parts of the night offer the Salah with it, as an additional prayer for you. It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud.) (17:79) Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÏúÈóÜÑó ÇáÓøõÌõæÏö</div><br>  (and after the prostrations.) refers to Tasbih, i.e. glorifying Allah's praises, after the prayers. There is a Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs that supports this meaning. Abu Hurayrah said, "Some poor migrants came and said, `O Allah's Messenger! The wealthy people will get higher grades and will have permanent enjoyment. ' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóãóÇ ĞóÇßó¿»</div><br>  (Why is that) They said, `They pray as we do, fast as we do, yet they give charity, but we can not. They free slaves, but we can not.' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóİóáóÇ ÃõÚóáøöãõßõãú ÔóíúÆğÇ ÅöĞóÇ İóÚóáúÊõãõæåõ ÓóÈóŞúÊõãú ãóäú ÈóÚúÏóßõãú æóáóÇ íóßõæäõ ÃóÍóÏñ ÃóİúÖóáó ãöäúßõãú ÅöáøóÇ ãóäú İóÚóáó ãöËúáó ãóÇ İóÚóáúÊõãú¿ ÊõÓóÈøöÍõæäó æóÊóÍúãóÏõæäó æóÊõßóÈøöÑõæäó ÏõÈõÑó ßõáøö ÕóáóÇÉò ËóáóÇËğÇ æóËóáóÇËöíä»</div><br>  (Shall I tell you about something that, if you did it, you would catch up with those who have surpassed you and nobody would be better than you except those who would do the same Say, `Subhan Allah, Alhamdulillah and Allahu Akbar,' thirty-three times each after every prayer.) Later, they came back and said, `O Allah's Messenger! Our brethren, the wealthy Muslims, heard of what we did and they also did the same.' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ğáößó İóÖúáõ Çááåö íõÄúÊöíåö ãóäú íóÔóÇÁ»</div><br>  (This is a favor and grace of Allah, and He grants it to whom He wills.)''  There is another way of explaining the Ayah. It is that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÏúÈóÜÑó ÇáÓøõÌõæÏö</div><br>  (and after the prostrations.) refers to the two Rak`ahs after the Maghrib prayer. This was reported from `Umar bin Al-Khattab, `Ali bin Abi Talib and his son Al-Hasan, `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Abu Hurayrah and Abu Umamah, may Allah be pleased with them. This is also the saying of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Ash-Sha`bi, An-Nakha`i, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, and others.  </div></body></html>
