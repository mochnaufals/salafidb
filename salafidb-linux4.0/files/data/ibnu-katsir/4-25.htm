And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess, and Allah has full knowledge about your faith, you are one from another. Wed them with the permission of their own folk (guardians) and give them their due in a good manner; they should be chaste, not fornicators, nor promiscuous. And after they have been taken in wedlock, if they commit Fahishah, their punishment is half that for free (unmarried) women. This is for him among you who is afraid of being harmed in his religion or in his body; but it is better for you that you practice self-restraint, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Marrying a Female Slave, if One Cannot Marry a Free Woman</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said, those who do not have,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöäßõãú ØóæúáÇğ</div><br>  (the means), financial capability,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä íóäßöÍó ÇáúãõÍúÕóäóÜÊö ÇáúãõÄúãöäóÜÊö</div><br>  (Wherewith to wed free believing women) meaning, free faithful, chaste women.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãöäú ãøóÇ ãóáóßóÊú ÃóíúãóÜäõßõã ãøöä İóÊóíóÜÊößõãõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäóÜÊö</div><br>  (They may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess,) meaning, they are allowed to wed believing slave girls owned by the believers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöÅöíãóÜäößõãú ÈóÚúÖõßõãú ãøöä ÈóÚúÖò</div><br>  (and Allah has full knowledge about your faith; you are one from another.)  Allah knows the true reality and secrets of all things, but you people know only the apparent things. Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇäßöÍõæåõäøó ÈöÅöĞúäö Ãóåúáöåöäøó</div><br>  (Wed them with the permission of their own folk) indicating that the owner is responsible for the slave girl, and consequently, she cannot marry without his permission. The owner is also responsible for his male slave and they cannot wed without his permission. A Hadith states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóíøõãóÇ ÚóÈúÏòÊóÒóæøóÌó ÈöÛóíúÑö ÅöĞúäö ãóæóÇáöíåö¡İóåõæó ÚóÇåöÑ»</div><br>  (Any male slave who marries without permission from his master, is a fornicator.)  When the owner of the female slave is a female, those who are allowed to give away the free woman in marriage, with her permission, become responsible for giving away her female slave in marriage, as well. A Hadith states that   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊõÒóæøöÌö ÇáúãóÑúÃóÉõ ÇáúãóÑúÃóÉó¡ æóáóÇ ÇáúãóÑúÃóÉõ äóİúÓóåóÇ¡ İóÅöäøó ÇáÒøóÇäöíóÉó åöíó ÇáøóÊöí ÊõÒóæøöÌõ äóİúÓóåóÇ»</div><br>  (The woman does not give away another woman, or herself in marriage, for only the adulteress gives herself away in marriage.)

Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÍúÕóäóÜÊ</div><br>  (they should be chaste) means, they are honorable women who do not commit adultery, and this is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÛóíúÑó ãõÓóÜİöÍóÜÊò</div><br>  (not fornicators) referring to dishonorable women, who do not refrain from illicit sexual relations with those who ask. Ibn `Abbas said that the fornicating women are the whores, who do not object to having relations with whomever seeks it, while,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ãõÊøóÎöĞóÇÊö ÃóÎúÏóÇäò</div><br>  (nor promiscuous. ) refers to taking boyfriends. Similar was said by Abu Hurayrah, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Yahya bin Abi Kathir, Muqatil bin Hayyan and As-Suddi. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Slave Girl's Punishment for Adultery is Half that of a Free Unmarried Woman</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÂ ÃõÍúÕöäøó İóÅöäú ÃóÊóíúäó ÈöİóÜÍöÔóÉò İóÚóáóíúåöäøó äöÕúİõ ãóÇ Úóáóì ÇáúãõÍúÕóäóÜÊö ãöäó ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö</div><br>  (And after they have been taken in wedlock, if they commit Fahishah, their punishment is half of that for free (unmarried) women.) this is about the slave women who got married, as indicated by the Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä áøóãú íóÓúÊóØöÚú ãöäßõãú ØóæúáÇğ Ãóä íóäßöÍó ÇáúãõÍúÕóäóÜÊö ÇáúãõÄúãöäóÜÊö İóãöäú ãøóÇ ãóáóßóÊú ÃóíúãóÜäõßõã ãøöä İóÊóíóÜÊößõãõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäóÜÊö</div><br>  (And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess,)  Therefore, since the honorable Ayah is about believing slave girls, then,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÂ ÃõÍúÕöäøó</div><br>  (And after they have been taken in wedlock,) refers to when they (believing slave girls) get married, as Ibn `Abbas and others have said. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äöÕúİõ ãóÇ Úóáóì ÇáúãõÍúÕóäóÜÊö ãöäó ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö</div><br>  (their punishment is half of that for free (unmarried) women.) indicates that the type of punishment prescribed here is the one that can be reduced to half, lashes in this case, not stoning to death, and Allah knows best. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó áöãóäú ÎóÔöìó ÇáúÚóäóÊó ãöäúßõãú</div><br>  (This is for him among you who is afraid of being harmed in his religion or in his body;) indicates that marrying slave girls, providing one satisfies the required conditions, is for those who fear for their chastity and find it hard to be patient and refrain from sex. In this difficult circumstance, one is allowed to marry a slave girl. However, it is better to refrain from marrying slave girls and to observe patience, for otherwise, the offspring will become slaves to the girl's master. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóä ÊóÕúÈöÑõæÇú ÎóíúÑñ áøóßõãú æóÇááøóåõ ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (but it is better for you that you practice self-restraint, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)  </div></body></html>
