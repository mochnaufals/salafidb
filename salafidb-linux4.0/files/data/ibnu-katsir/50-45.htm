Allah the Exalted and Most Honored will send down rain from the sky. From that rain the bodies of the creations will grow while they are in their graves, just as the seed grows in soil in the aftermath of rain. When the bodies grow to their full strength, Allah the Exalted will command angel Israfil and he will blow in the Trumpet (for a second time). The souls will be enclosed in a hole in the Trumpet. When Israfil blows in the Trumpet, the souls will depart from it and will fly between the heavens and earth. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored, will declare, "By My grace and power, each soul shall return to the body that it used to inhabit,'' and indeed, every soul will return to its body. The soul will enter its body just as poison enters the body, then the earth will be uncovered from above them, and they will all stand and head towards the Reckoning place hastening to obey the command of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõåúØöÚöíäó Åöáóì ÇáÏøóÇÚö íóŞõæáõ ÇáúßóÜİöÑõæäó åóÜĞóÇ íóæúãñ ÚóÓöÑñ </div><br>  (Hastening towards the caller.
