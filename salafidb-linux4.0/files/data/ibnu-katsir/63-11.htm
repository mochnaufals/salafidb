Allah informs them that those who engage in this life, its delights and attributes and were busied from the obedience and remembrance of Allah, for which they were created, will be among the losers. They will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Allah encourages the believers to spend in His cause,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäİöŞõæÇú ãöä ãøóÇ ÑóÒóŞúäóÜßõãú ãøöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä íóÃúÊöìó ÃóÍóÏóßõãõ ÇáúãóæúÊõ İóíóŞõæáõ ÑóÈøö áóæúáÇ ÃóÎøóÑúÊóäöì Åöáóì ÃóÌóáò ŞóÑöíÈò İóÃóÕøóÏøóŞó æóÃóßõä ãøöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó </div><br>  (And spend of that with which We have provided you before death comes to one of you, and he says: "My Lord!

Surely, every person who fell into shortcomings will regret it by the time of his death and will ask for respite, even a short period, so that he does better and attains what he missed. No, rather what occurred, has occurred and what is coming, shall indeed come. Each will be held accountable for his mistakes. As for the disbelievers, they will be as Allah said about them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäĞöÑö ÇáäøóÇÓó íóæúãó íóÃúÊöíåöãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ İóíóŞõæáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÎøöÑúäóÂ Åöáóì ÃóÌóáò ŞóÑöíÈò äøõÌöÈú ÏóÚúæóÊóßó æóäóÊøóÈöÚö ÇáÑøõÓõáó Ãóæóáóãú ÊóßõæäõæÇú ÃóŞúÓóãúÊõãú ãøöä ŞóÈúáõ ãóÇ áóßõãú ãøöä ÒóæóÇáò </div><br>  (And warn mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them; then the wrongdoers will say:"Our Lord!
