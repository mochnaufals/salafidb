If this is the case, then why do they deny the resurrection, when they see things that are greater than that which they deny As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÎóáúŞõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÃóßúÜÈóÑõ ãöäú ÎóáúŞö ÇáäøóÇÓö æóáóÜßöäøó ÃóßúÜËóÑó ÇáäøóÇÓö áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not) (40:57) Then Allah explains that they were created from something weak, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÎóáóŞúäóÜåõã ãøöä Øöíäò áÇøóÒöÈò</div><br>  (Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.) Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak said, "This is the useful kind of mud which sticks to itself.'' Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and `Ikrimah said, "It is sticky and useful.'' Qatadah said, "It is that which sticks to the hand.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ÚóÌöÈúÊó æóíóÓúÎõÑõæäó </div><br>  (Nay, you wondered while they mock.) means, `you were astounded, O Muhammad, at these people who denied the resurrection whilst you were certain that it is true, when they disbelieved in what Allah told you of this wondrous matter, which is the re-creation of their bodies after they have disintegrated. They oppose what you say because of their intense disbelief and they make fun of what you tell them about that.' Qatadah said, "Muhammad was astounded by the mockery of the misguided ones among the sons of Adam.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÑóÃóæúÇú ÁóÇíóÉğ</div><br>  (And when they see an Ayah) means, clear evidence and proof,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÊóÓúÎöÑõæäó</div><br>  (they mock at it.)

This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßõáøñ ÃóÊóæúåõ ÏóÎöÑöíäó</div><br>  (And all shall come to Him, humbled) (27:87), and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÓúÊóßúÈöÑõæäó Úóäú ÚöÈóÇÏóÊöì ÓóíóÏúÎõáõæäó Ìóåóäøóãó ÏóÎöÑöíäó</div><br>  (Verily, those who scorn My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!)

And Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
