Verily, those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and humble themselves before their Lord, they will be the dwellers of Paradise to dwell therein forever.) (24. The likeness of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seer and the hearer. Are they equal when compared Will you not then take heed)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Rewarding the People of Faith</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  When Allah, the Exalted, mentioned the condition of the wretched, He also commended the people of delight (the believers). They are those who believe and work righteous deeds. Thus, their hearts believed and their limbs worked righteous deeds, both in statements and actions. This includes their performance of deeds of obedience and their abandonment of evils. In this way they are the inheritors of Gardens (of Paradise), which contain lofty rooms and seats arranged in rows. Therein they will find bunches of fruit near to them, elevated couches, fair and beautiful wives, various types of fruit, desired kinds of food and delicious drinks. They also will be allowed to see the Creator of the heavens and the earth and they will be in this state of pleasure forever. They will not die, nor will they grow old. They will not experience sickness, nor will they sleep. They will not have excrement, nor will they spit or snot. Their sweat will be the perfume of musk. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Parable of the Believers and the Disbelievers</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then, Allah, the Exalted, makes a parable of the disbelievers and the believers. He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóËóáõ ÇáúİóÑöíŞóíúäö</div><br>  (The likeness of the two parties) This refers to those disbelievers whom Allah first described as wretched, and then those believers whom He described with delightfulness. The first group is like one who is blind and deaf, while the second group is like he who sees and hears. Thus, the disbeliever is blind from the truth in this life and in the Hereafter. He is not guided to goodness, nor does he recognize it. He is deaf from hearing the proofs, thus he does not hear that which would benefit him. As Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú Úóáöãó Çááøóåõ İöíåöãú ÎóíúÑğÇ áÃóÓúãóÚóåõãú</div><br>  (Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen.)8:23 The believer is smart, bright and clever. He sees the truth and distinguishes between the truth and falsehood. Thus, he follows the good and abandons the evil. He hears and distinguishes between the proof and scepticism. Therefore, falsehood does not overcome him. Are these two types of people alike   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó ÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó </div><br>  (Will you not then take heed) This statement means, "Will you not consider, so that you may distinguish between these two categories of people.'' This is as Allah mentions in another verse,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÓúÊóæöì ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáäøóÇÑö æóÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö åõãõ ÇáúİóÂÆöÒõæäó </div><br>  (Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.)59:20 Allah also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÓúÊóæöì ÇáÇøñÚúãóì æóÇáúÈóÕöíÑõ - æóáÇó ÇáÙøõáõãóÇÊõ æóáÇó ÇáäøõæÑõ - æóáÇó ÇáÙøöáøõ æóáÇó ÇáúÍóÑõæÑõ - æóãóÇ íóÓúÊóæöì ÇáÇøñÍúíóÂÁõ æóáÇó ÇáÇøñãúæóÇÊõ Åöäøó Çááøóåó íõÓúãöÚõ ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ æóãóÂ ÃóäÊó ÈöãõÓúãöÚò ãøóä İöì ÇáúŞõÈõæÑö - Åöäú ÃóäÊó ÅöáÇøó äóĞöíÑñ - ÅöäøóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÜßó ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö ÈóÔöíÑÇğ æóäóĞöíÑÇğ æóÅöä ãøöäú ÃõãøóÉò ÅöáÇøó ÎóáÇó İöíåóÇ äóĞöíÑñ </div><br>  (Not alike are the blind and the seeing. Nor are (alike) darkness and light. Nor are (alike) the shade and the sun's heat. Nor are (alike) the living and the dead. Verily, Allah makes whom He wills to hear, but you cannot make hear those who are in graves. You are only a warner. Verily, We have sent you with the truth, a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. And there never was a nation but a warner had passed among them.)35:19-24  </div></body></html>
