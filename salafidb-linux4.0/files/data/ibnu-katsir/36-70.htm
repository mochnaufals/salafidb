He creates what He wills. And it is He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.) (30:54). And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäßõãú ãøóä íõÑóÏøõ Åöáóì ÃóÑúĞóáö ÇáúÚõãõÑö áößóíúáÇó íóÚúáóãó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö Úöáúãò ÔóíúÆÇğ</div><br>  (And among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age, so that he knows nothing after having known) (22:5). The meaning here -- and Allah knows best -- is that Allah is telling us that this world is transient and will come to an end, it is not eternal and lasting. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóİóáÇó íóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (Will they not then understand) meaning, will they not think about how they were created, then they become gray-haired, then they become old and senile, so that they may know that they were created for another world that is not transient and will not pass away, and from which there is no way out, which is the Hereafter. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah does not teach His Messenger Poetry</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÚóáøóãúäóÜåõ ÇáÔøöÚúÑó æóãóÇ íóäÈóÛöì áóåõ</div><br>  (And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it suitable for him.) Allah tells us that He has not taught His Prophet Muhammad poetry.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóäÈóÛöì áóåõ</div><br>  (nor is it suitable for him.) means, he did not know how to compose it, he did not like it and he had no natural inclination towards it. It was narrated that he never memorized a stanza of poetry with the correct meter or rhyme -- he would transpose words or memorize it incompletely. In Ad-Dala'il, Al-Bayhaqi recorded that the Messenger of Allah said to Al-`Abbas bin Mirdas As-Sulami, may Allah be pleased with him:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÊó ÇáúŞóÇÆöáõ: ÃóÊóÌúÚóáõ äóåúÈöí æóäóåúÈó ÇáúÚõÈóíÏö Èóíúäó ÇáúÃóŞúÑóÚö æóÚõíóíúäóÉ»</div><br>  (You are the one who said: "Do you distribute my booty and the booty of the servants between Al-Aqra` and `Uyainah.'') He said, "It is `Uyainah and Al-Aqra`.'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çáúßõáøõ ÓóæóÇÁ»</div><br>  (It is all the same.) i.e., it means the same thing. And Allah knows best. This is because Allah taught him the Qur'an, which   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóÃúÊöíåö ÇáúÈóÜØöáõ ãöä Èóíúäö íóÏóíúåö æóáÇó ãöäú Îóáúİöåö ÊóäÒöíáñ ãøöäú Íóßöíãò ÍóãöíÏò </div><br>  (Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it; sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise.) (41:42). This is not poetry, as some of the ignorant disbelievers of the Quraysh claimed; neither is it sorcery, a fabrication or a magic spell, as the misguided and ignorant people variously suggested. The Prophet was naturally disinclined to compose verse, and was forbidden to do so by Divine Law.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäú åõæó ÅöáÇøó ĞößúÑñ æóŞõÑúÁóÇäñ ãøõÈöíäñ</div><br>  (This is only a Reminder and a plain Qur'an.) means, it is clear and self-explanatory to the one who ponders and comprehends its meanings, Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöíõäĞöÑó ãóä ßóÇäó ÍóíøÇğ</div><br>  (That he or it may give warning to him who is living,) meaning, so that this plain Qur'an might warn every living person on the face of the earth. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøñäĞöÑóßõãú Èöåö æóãóä ÈóáóÛó</div><br>  (that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach) (6:19).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóßúİõÑú Èöåö ãöäó ÇáÇøñÍúÒóÇÈö İóÇáäøóÇÑõ ãóæúÚöÏõåõ</div><br>  (but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place) (11:17). Those who will benefit from his warning will be those whose hearts are alive and who have enlightened insight, as Qatadah said, "Alive of heart and alive of insight.'' Ad-Dahhak said, "This means wise.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÍöŞøó ÇáúŞóæúáõ Úóáóì ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (and that Word may be justified against the disbelievers.) means, it is a mercy to the believers and evidence against the disbelievers.  </div></body></html>
