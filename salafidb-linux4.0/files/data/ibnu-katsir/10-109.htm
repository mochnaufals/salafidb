Say: "O people! Now the truth has come to you from your Lord. So whoever receives guidance, he does so for the good of himself. And whoever goes astray, he does so at his own loss. And I am not set over you as a guardian.) (109. And follow what is revealed to you, and be patient until Allah gives judgment. And He is the best of the judges.) Allah, the Exalted, commands His Messenger to inform the people that that which he has brought them from Allah is the truth. It is a message concerning which there is no doubt or suspicion. Therefore, whoever is guided by it and follows it, then he only benefits himself by doing so. Likewise, whoever is misguided away from this message, then he will suffer the consequences against his own self.</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóäóÇú Úóáóíúßõãú Èöæóßöíáò</div><br>  (And I am not set over you as a guardian) This means, `I am not a guardian over you in order for you to become believers.
