Allah is far removed from what they ascribe to Him. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáõæÇú ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉó ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú ÚöÈóÇÏõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ÅöäóÜËÇğ ÃóÔóåöÏõæÇú ÎóáúŞóåõãú ÓóÊõßúÊóÈõ ÔóåóÜÏóÊõåõãú æóíõÓúÜóáõæäó </div><br>  (And they make females the angels, who themselves are servants of the Most Gracious. Did they witness their creation Their testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned!)(43:19) Allah's statement here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ áóåõã Èöåö ãöäú Úöáúãò</div><br>  (But they have no knowledge thereof.) meaning, they have no correct knowledge testifying to their statements. What they say is all lies, falsehood, fake and utter atheism,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä íóÊøóÈöÚõæäó ÅöáÇøó ÇáÙøóäøó æóÅöäøó ÇáÙøóäøó áÇó íõÛúäöì ãöäó ÇáúÍóŞøö ÔóíúÆÇğ</div><br>  (They follow but conjecture, and verily, conjecture is no substitute for the truth.) meaning, conjecture is of no benefit and never takes the place of truth. In a Hadith recorded in the Sahih, the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöíøóÇßõãú æóÇáÙøóäøó¡ İóÅöäøó ÇáÙøóäøó ÃóßúĞóÈõ ÇáúÍóÏöíË»</div><br>  (Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the most lying speech.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Necessity of turning away from the People of Misguidance</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÚúÑöÖú Úóä ãøóä Êóæóáøóì Úóä ĞößúÑöäóÇ</div><br>  (Therefore withdraw from him who turns away from Our Reminder), means, stay away from those who turn away from the Truth and shun them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóãú íõÑöÏú ÅöáÇøó ÇáúÍóíóæÉó ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ</div><br>  (and desires nothing but the life of this world.) meaning, whose aim and knowledge are concentrated on this life; this is the goal of those who have no goodness in them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ãóÈúáóÛõåõãú ãøöäó ÇáúÚöáúãö</div><br>  (That is what they could reach of knowledge.) meaning, seeking this life and striving hard in its affairs is the best knowledge they have acquired. There is also the reported supplication:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááúåõãøó áóÇ ÊóÌúÚóáö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÃóßúÈóÑó åóãøöäóÇ¡ æóáóÇ ãóÈúáóÛó ÚöáúãöäóÇ»</div><br>  (O Allah! Make not this life the greatest of our concerns nor the best knowledge that we can attain.) Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó åõæó ÃóÚúáóãõ Èöãóä Öóáøó Úóä ÓóÈöíáöåö æóåõæó ÃóÚúáóãõ Èöãóäö ÇåúÊóÏóì</div><br>  (Verily, your Lord is He, Who knows best him who goes astray from His path, and He knows best him who receives guidance.) meaning, He is the Creator of all creatures and He knows whatever benefits His servants. Allah is the One Who guides whom He wills and misguides whom He wills, and all of this indicates His power, knowledge and wisdom. Certainly, He is Just and never legislates or decrees unjustly.  </div></body></html>
