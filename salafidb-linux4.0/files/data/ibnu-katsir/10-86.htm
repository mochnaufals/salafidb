If you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims.) Allah is sufficient for those who put their trust in Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáóíúÓó Çááøóåõ ÈößóÇİò ÚóÈúÏóåõ</div><br>  (Is not Allah sufficient for His servant)(39:36)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÊóæóßøóáú Úóáóì Çááøóåö İóåõæó ÍóÓúÈõåõ</div><br>  (And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.)(65:3) Allah combines worship and reliance in many places. He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúÈõÏúåõ æóÊóæóßøóáú Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (So worship Him and put your trust in Him.)(11:123)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Èöåö æóÚóáóíúåö ÊóæóßøóáúäóÇ</div><br>  (Say: "He is the Most Gracious (Allah), in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust..)(67:29) and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøóÈøõ ÇáúãóÔúÑöŞö æóÇáúãóÛúÑöÈö áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó İóÇÊøóÎöĞúåõ æóßöíáÇğ </div><br>  ((He alone is) the Lord of the east and the west; none has the right to be worshipped but He. So take Him (alone) as a protector.)(73:9) And Allah commanded the believers to say many times in their Salah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöíøóÇßó äóÚúÈõÏõ æóÅöíøóÇßó äóÓúÊóÚöíäõ </div><br>  (You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything).)(1:5)  The Children of Israel complied with this command and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÊóæóßøóáúäóÇ ÑóÈøóäóÇ áÇó ÊóÌúÚóáúäóÇ İöÊúäóÉğ áøöáúŞóæúãö ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk who are wrongdoers.) This means don't give them victory over us so that they rule us. So they might not think that they have authority over us because they were following the truth and we were falsehood. This might be a deceiving trial for them. This meaning was reported from Abu Mijliz and Abu Ad-Duha, `Abdur-Razzaq, in a narration from Mujahid, said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøóäóÇ áÇó ÊóÌúÚóáúäóÇ İöÊúäóÉğ áøöáúŞóæúãö ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk who are wrongdoers) meaning, "Do not give them authority over us so they might make us fall into Fitnah.'' Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÌøöäóÇ ÈöÑóÍúãóÊößó</div><br>  (And save us by Your mercy) means save us through Your mercy and beneficence   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöäó ÇáúŞóæúãö ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (from the disbelieving folk. ) meaning, from those who denied the truth and covered it. We truly have believed in You and put our trust in You.  </div></body></html>
