Therefore, the sky, with its height, intricate design, vastness, the heavenly objects in orbit, and this earth, with its density, its lowlands, mountains, seas, deserts, valleys, and other structures, and beneficial things that it has. Allah continues:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÎúÊöáóÜİö Çáøóíúáö æóÇáäøóåóÇÑö</div><br>  (...and in the alternation of night and day.)  This (the night) comes and then goes followed by the other (the day) which does not delay for even an instant, just as Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÇáÔøóãúÓõ íóäÈóÛöì áóåóÂ Ãóä ÊÏúÑößó ÇáŞóãóÑó æóáÇó Çáøóíúáõ ÓóÇÈöŞõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑö æóßõáøñ İöì İóáóßò íóÓúÈóÍõæäó </div><br>  (It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit.) (36:40)  Sometimes, the day grows shorter and the night longer, and sometimes vice versa, one takes from the length of the other. Similarly Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõæáöÌõ Çáøóíúáó İöì ÇáäøóåóÇÑö æóíõæáöÌõ ÇáäøóåóÇÑó İöì Çáøóíúáö</div><br>  (Allah merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night) (57:6) meaning, He extends the length of one from the other and vice versa. Allah then continues:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúİõáúßö ÇáøóÊöì ÊóÌúÑöì İöì ÇáúÈóÍúÑö ÈöãóÇ íóäİóÚõ ÇáäøóÇÓó</div><br>  (. ..and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind,)  Shaping the sea in this manner, so that it is able to carry ships from one shore to another, so people benefit from what the other region has, and export what they have to them and vice versa.

And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus or grave). All is in a Clear Book (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz Ü the Book of Decrees with Allah).) (11:6)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóÕúÑöíİö ÇáÑøöíóÜÍö</div><br>  (...and in the veering of winds...)  Sometimes, the wind brings mercy and sometimes torment. Sometimes it brings the good news of the clouds that follow it, sometimes it leads the clouds, herding them, scattering them or directing them. Sometimes, the wind comes from the north (the northern wind), and sometimes from the south, sometimes from the east, and striking the front of the Ka`bah, sometimes from the west, striking its back. There are many books about the wind rain, stars and the regulations related to them, but here is not the place to elaborate on that, and Allah knows best.  Allah continues:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÓøóÍóÇÈö ÇáúãõÓóÎøóÑö Èóíúäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö æóÇáÃóÑúÖö</div><br>  (...and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth,)  The clouds run between the sky and the earth to wherever Allah wills of lands and areas.  Allah said next:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÂíóÜÊò áøöŞóæúãò íóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (...are indeed Ayat for people of understanding,) meaning, all these things are clear signs that testify to Allah's Oneness.

Those who remember Allah (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): "Our Lord!
