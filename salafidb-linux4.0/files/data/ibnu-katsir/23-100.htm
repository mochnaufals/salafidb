Abu Salih and others said that:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöä æóÑóÂÆöåöãú</div><br>  (and in front of them) means before them. Mujahid said, Al-Barzakh is a barrier between this world and the Hereafter. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, "Al-Barzakh is what is between this world and the Hereafter, neither they are the people of this world, eating and drinking, nor are they with the people of the Hereafter, being rewarded or punished for their deeds.'' Abu Sakhr said, "Al-Barzakh refers to the graves.
