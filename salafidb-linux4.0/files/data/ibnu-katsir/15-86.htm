Then Allah informed His Prophet about the Hour, and that it will be the faults of the idolators when they insult him and reject the Message that he brings to them. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÕúİóÍú Úóäúåõãú æóŞõáú ÓóáóÜãñ İóÓóæúİó íóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (So turn away from them, and say: "Salam (Peace!).'' But they will come to know) (43:89). Mujahid, Qatadah and others said: "This was before fighting was prescribed''. It is as they said, because this Surah was revealed in Makkah and fighting was prescribed after the Hijrah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó åõæó ÇáúÎóáøóÜŞõ ÇáúÚóáöíãõ </div><br>  (Verily, your Lord is the Knowing Creator)(15:86). This is a confirmation of the Day of Resurrection and that Allah, may He be exalted, is able to bring the Hour to pass. He is the Creator and nothing is beyond Him. He is the Knowing, Who knows what has been dispersed from people's bodies and scattered throughout the regions of the earth, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóæóáóÜíúÓó ÇáóĞöì ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãóÜæÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó ÈöŞóÜÏöÑò Úóáóì Ãóä íóÎúáõŞó ãöËúáóåõã Èóáóì æóåõæó ÇáúÎóáøóÜŞõ ÇáúÚóáöíãõ - ÅöäøóãóÂ ÃóãúÑõåõ ÅöĞóÂ ÃóÑóÇÏó ÔóíúÆÇğ Ãóä íóŞõæáó áóåõ ßõä İóíóßõæäõ - İóÓõÈúÍóÜäó ÇáøóĞöì ÈöíóÏöåö ãóáóßõæÊõ ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò æóÅöáóíúåö ÊõÑúÌóÚõæäó </div><br>  (Is not He, Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them Yes, indeed!

So glorified and exalted is He above all that they associate with Him, and in whose Hands is the dominion of all things, and to Him you shall return.)(36:81-83).  </div></body></html>
