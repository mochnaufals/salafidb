However, the good end was theirs, and the ultimate defeat was for the disbelievers. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÓöíÑõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö İóÇäúÙõÑõæÇú ßóíúİó ßóÇäó ÚóÜŞöÈóÉõ ÇáúãõßóĞøöÈöíäó</div><br>  (so travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who denied). Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ ÈóíóÇäñ áøöáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (This is a plain statement for mankind), meaning, the Qur'an explains the true reality of things and narrates how the previous nations suffered by the hands of their enemies.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõÏğì æóãóæúÚöÙóÉñ</div><br>  (And a guidance and instruction) for the Qur'an contains the news of the past, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõÏğì</div><br>  (guidance) for your hearts,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóæúÚöÙóÉğ áøöáúãõÊøóŞöíäó</div><br>  (and instruction for the Muttaqin) to discourage committing the prohibited and forbidden matters.

And that Allah may test those who believe) 3:140,141, by forgiving them their sins if they have any. Otherwise, Allah will raise their grades according to the losses they suffered. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóãúÍóŞó ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (and destroy the disbelievers), for it is their conduct that if they gain the upper hand, they transgress and commit aggression. However, this conduct only leads to ultimate destruction, extermination, perishing and dying out.  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÍóÓöÈúÊõãú Ãóä ÊóÏúÎõáõæÇú ÇáúÌóäøóÉó æóáóãøóÇ íóÚúáóãö Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÌóÜåóÏõæÇú ãöäßõãú æóíóÚúáóãó ÇáÕøóÜÈöÑöíäó </div><br>  (Do you think that you will enter Paradise before Allah knows (tests) those of you who will perform Jihad and (also) knows (tests) those who are the patient) 3:142.  The Ayah asks, do you think that you will enter Paradise without being tested with warfare and hardships Allah said in Surat Al-Baqarah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÍóÓöÈúÊõãú Ãóä ÊóÏúÎõáõæÇú ÇáúÌóäøóÉó æóáóãøóÇ íóÃúÊößõã ãøóËóáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÎóáóæúÇú ãöä ŞóÈúáößõã ãøóÓøóÊúåõãõ ÇáúÈóÃúÓóÂÁõ æóÇáÖøóÑøóÂÁõ æóÒõáúÒöáõæÇú</div><br>  (Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken. ..) 2:214.

Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: "We believe,'' and will not be tested) 29:1,2, This is why He said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÍóÓöÈúÊõãú Ãóä ÊóÏúÎõáõæÇú ÇáúÌóäøóÉó æóáóãøóÇ íóÚúáóãö Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÌóÜåóÏõæÇú ãöäßõãú æóíóÚúáóãó ÇáÕøóÜÈöÑöíäó </div><br>  (Do you think that you will enter Paradise before Allah knows (tests) those of you who will perform Jihad and (also) knows (tests) those who are the patient) 3:142 meaning, you will not earn Paradise until you are tested and thus Allah knows who among you are the ones who struggle and fight in His cause and are patient in the face of the enemy. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ßõäÊõãú Êóãóäøóæúäó ÇáúãóæúÊó ãöä ŞóÈúáö Ãóä ÊóáúŞóæúåõ İóŞóÏú ÑóÃóíúÊõãõæåõ æóÃóäÊõãú ÊóäÙõÑõæäó </div><br>  (You did indeed wish for death (martyrdom) before you met it. Now you have seen it openly with your own eyes) 3:143.  The Ayah proclaims, O believers! Before today, you wished that you could meet the enemy and were eager to fight them. What you wished has occurred, so fight them and be patient.  In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÊóãóäøóæúÇ áöŞóÇÁó ÇáúÚóÏõæøö¡ æóÓóáõæÇ Çááåó ÇáúÚóÇİöíóÉó¡ İóÅöĞóÇ áóŞöíÊõãõæåõãú İóÇÕúÈöÑõæÇ¡ æóÇÚúáóãõæÇ Ãóäøó ÇáúÌóäøóÜÉó ÊóÍúÊó ÙöáóÇáö ÇáÓøõíõæİ»</div><br>  (Do not wish to encounter the enemy, and ask Allah for your well-being. However, if you do encounter them, then observe patience and know that Paradise is under the shade of swords.)  This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóÏú ÑóÃóíúÊõãõæåõ</div><br>  (Now you have seen it): death, you saw it when the swords appeared, the blades were sharpened, the spears crisscrossed and men stood in lines for battle. This part of the Ayah contains a figure of speech that mentions imagining what can be felt but not seen.  </div></body></html>
