Then He mentions those who came in between them who were the Messengers of strong will, namely Ibrahim, Musa and `Isa bin Maryam. This Ayah mentions all five, just as they are also mentioned in the Ayah in Surat Al-Ahzab, where Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ÃóÎóĞúäóÇ ãöäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíúäó ãöíËóÇŞóåõãú æóãöäúßó æóãöä äøõæÍò æóÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóãõæÓóì æóÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäö ãóÑúíóãó</div><br>  (And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you, and from Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, and `Isa son of Maryam.) (33:7). The Message which all the Messengers brought was to worship Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáößó ãöä ÑøóÓõæáò ÅöáÇøó äõæÍöì Åöáóíúåö Ãóäøóåõ áÇ ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó ÃóäóÇú İóÇÚúÈõÏõæäö </div><br>  (And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying): None has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me.) (21:25). And according to a Hadith (the Prophet said):   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«äóÍúäõ ãóÚúÔóÑó ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁö ÃóæúáóÇÏõ ÚóáøóÇÊò¡ ÏöíäõäóÇ æóÇÍöÏ»</div><br>  (We Prophets are brothers and our religion is one.) In other words, the common bond between them is that Allah Alone is to be worshipped, with no partner or associate, even though their laws and ways may differ, as Allah says.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áößõáøò ÌóÚóáúäóÇ ãöäßõãú ÔöÑúÚóÉğ æóãöäúåóÜÌÇğ</div><br>  (To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way) (5:48).

Allah says here;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÊóİóÑøóŞõæÇúÇááøóåö ÅöáÇøó ãóäÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõãõ ÇáúÚöáúãõ</div><br>  (And they divided not till after knowledge had come to them,) means, their opposition to the truth arose after it had come to them and proof had been established against them. Nothing made them resist in this manner except their transgression and stubbornness.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæúáÇó ßóáöãóÉñ ÓóÈóŞóÊú ãöä ÑøóÈøößó Åöáóì ÃóÌóáò ãøõÓóãøğì</div><br>  (And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord for an appointed term,) means, were it not for the fact that Allah had already decreed that He would delay the reckoning of His servants until the Day of Resurrection, the punishment would have been hastened for them in this world.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÑöËõæÇú ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåöãú</div><br>  (And verily, those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them,) means, the later generation which came after the earlier generation which had rejected the truth.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóİöì Ôóßøò ãøöäúåõ ãõÑöíÈò</div><br>  (are in grave doubt concerning it. ) means, they do not have any firm conviction in matters of religion; they merely imitate their forefathers, without any evidence or proof. So they are very confused and doubtful.  </div></body></html>
