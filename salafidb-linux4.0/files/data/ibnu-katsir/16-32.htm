But the blessed, on the other hand, will say, "That which is good,'' meaning - He revealed something good, meaning mercy and blessings for those who followed it and believed in it. Then we are told about Allah's promise to His servants which He revealed to His Messengers. He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöáøóĞöíäó ÃóÍúÓóäõæÇú İöì åĞöåö ÇáúÏøõäúíóÇ ÍóÓóäóÉñ</div><br>  (For those who do good in this world, there is good) This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóäú Úóãöáó ÕóÜáöÍÇğ ãøöä ĞóßóÑò Ãóæú ÃõäúËóì æóåõæó ãõÄúãöäñ İóáóäõÍúíöíóäøóåõ ÍóíóæÉğ ØóíøöÈóÉğ æóáóäóÌúÒöíóäøóåõãú ÃóÌúÑóåõã ÈöÃóÍúÓóäö ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (Whoever works righteousness - whether male or female - while being a true believer verily, to him We will give a good life, and We shall certainly reward them in proportion to the best of what they used to do.) (16:97), which means that whoever does good in this world, Allah will reward him for his good deeds in this world and in the next. Then we are told that the home of the Hereafter will be better, i.e., better than the life of this world, and that the reward in the Hereafter will be more complete than the reward in this life, as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúÚöáúãó æóíúáóßõãú ËóæóÇÈõ Çááøóåö ÎóíúÑñ</div><br>  (But those who were given (religious) knowledge said: "Woe to you!

Then Allah tells us about their condition when death approaches them in a good state, i.e., free from Shirk, impurity and all evil. The angels greet them and give them the good news of Paradise, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ŞóÇáõæÇú ÑóÈøõäóÇ Çááøóåõ Ëõãøó ÇÓúÊóŞóÜãõæÇú ÊóÊóäóÒøóáõ Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉõ ÃóáÇøó ÊóÎóÇİõæÇú æóáÇó ÊóÍúÒóäõæÇú æóÃóÈúÔöÑõæÇú ÈöÇáúÌóäøóÉö ÇáøóÊöì ßõäÊõãú ÊõæÚóÏõæäó - äóÍúäõ ÃóæúáöíóÂÄõßõãú İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóİöì ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö æóáóßõãú İöíåóÇ ãóÇ ÊóÔúÊóåöì ÃóäİõÓõßõãú æóáóßõãú İöíåóÇ ãóÇ ÊóÏøóÚõæäó - äõÒõáÇğ ãøöäú ÛóİõæÑò ÑøóÍöíãò </div><br>  (Verily, those who say: "Our Lord is Allah (alone),'' and then behave righteously, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): "Fear not, nor grieve!

In it you shall have (all) that your souls desire, and in it you shall have (all) that you ask for. An entertainment from (Allah), the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'')(41:30:32) We have already referred to the Hadiths that have been reported on the taking of the soul of the believer and the soul of the disbeliever, when we discussed the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõËóÈøöÊõ Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÈöÇáúŞóæúáö ÇáËøóÇÈöÊö İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóİöì ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö æóíõÖöáøõ Çááøóåõ ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó æóíóİúÚóáõ Çááøóåõ ãóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ </div><br>  (Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allah Alone and none else), and in the Hereafter.
