We have already discussed the Hadith:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÏúÚõæÇ Úóáóì ÃóäúİõÓößõãú¡ æóáóÇ Úóáóì ÃóãúæóÇáößõãú Ãóäú ÊõæóÇİöŞõæÇ ãöäó Çááåö ÓóÇÚóÉó ÅöÌóÇÈóÉò íóÓúÊóÌöíÈõ İöíåóÇ»</div><br>  (Do not pray against yourselves or your wealth, for that might coincide with a time when Allah answers prayers.) What makes the son of Adam do that is his anxiety and haste. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÇáÅöäúÓóÜäõ ÚóÌõæáÇğ</div><br>  (And man is ever hasty.) Salman Al-Farisi and Ibn `Abbas mentioned the story of Adam, when he wanted to get up before his soul reached his feet. When his soul was breathed into him, it entered his body from his head downwards. When it reached his brain he sneezed, and said, "Al-Hamdu Lillah'' (praise be to Allah), and Allah said, "May your Lord have mercy on you, O Adam.'' When it reached his eyes, he opened them, and when it reached his body and limbs he started to stare at them in wonder. He wanted to get up before it reached his feet, but he could not. He said, "O Lord, make it happen before night comes.''  </div></body></html>
