It is apparent that Sulayman, peace be upon him, did not even look at what they brought at all and did not pay any attention to it, but he turned away and said, rebuking them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊõãöÏøõæäóäö ÈöãóÇáò</div><br>  ("Will you help me in wealth'') meaning, `are you trying to flatter me with wealth so that I will leave you alone with your Shirk and your kingdom'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÂ ÁóÇÊóÜäöì Çááøóåõ ÎóíúÑñ ãøöãøóÂ ÁóÇÊóÜßõãú</div><br>  (What Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you!) means, `what Allah has given to me of power, wealth and troops, is better than that which you have.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ÃóäÊõãú ÈöåóÏöíøóÊößõãú ÊóİúÑóÍõæäó</div><br>  (Nay, you rejoice in your gift!) means, `you are the ones who are influenced by gifts and presents; we will accept nothing from you except Islam or the sword.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇÑúÌöÚú Åöáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (Go back to them) means, with their gift,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóäóÃúÊöíóäøóåõã ÈöÌõäõæÏò áÇøó ŞöÈóáó áóåõãú ÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (We verily, shall come to them with armies that they cannot resist,) they have no power to match them or resist them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóäõÎúÑöÌóäøóåõã ãøöäúåóÂ ÃóĞöáøóÉğ</div><br>  (and we shall drive them out from there in disgrace,) `we shall drive them out in disgrace from their land.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú ÕóÜÛöÑõæäó</div><br>  (and they will be abased.) means, humiliated and expelled. When her messengers came back to her with her undelivered gift, and told her what Sulayman said, she and her people paid heed and obeyed him. She came to him with her troops in submission and humility, honoring Sulayman and intending to follow him in Islam. When Sulayman, peace be upon him, realized that they were coming to him, he rejoiced greatly.  </div></body></html>
