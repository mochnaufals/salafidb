There was a good horse which belonged to a rich man who was also righteous. The horse just stood there, so its owner said, `What is the matter with you Woe to you! I was only preparing you for a day such as this.' The horse said to him: `How can you expect me not to perform badly, when you delegated my feeding to the grooms, and they mistreated me and only fed me a little' The man said, `I make you a promise before Allah that from this day on, only I will feed you from my own lap.' So the horse began to run, and his owner was saved, and after that he only ever fed the horse from his own lap. This story became well known among the people, and they started to come to him to hear the story from his own lips. News of this reached the king of Byzantium, and he said: `A city where this man is, will be kept safe from harm.' He wanted to bring the man to his own city, so he sent an apostate (a man who had left Islam) who was living in his city to go to him, and when he reached him, he pretended that his intentions towards Islam and its followers were good, so the Mujahid trusted him. One day they went out walking along the shore, but the apostate made a pact with another person, a follower of the Byzantine king, to come and help him take the Mujahid prisoner. When they made their move, he lifted his gaze to the sky and said, `O Allah! He has deceived me by swearing in Your Name, so protect me in whatever way You will.' Then two wild animals came out and seized them, and the Mujahid came back safe and sound. '' The Inheritance of the Earth   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÌúÚóáõßõãú ÍõáóİóÂÁó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (and makes you inheritors of the earth,) means, each generation inherits from the generation that came before them, one after the other, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä íóÔóÃú íõĞúåöÈúßõãú æóíóÓúÊóÎúáöİú ãöä ÈóÚúÏößõã ãøóÇ íóÔóÂÁõ ßóãóÂ ÃóäÔóÃóßõãú ãøöä ĞõÑøöíøóÉö Şóæúãò ÁóÇÎóÑöíäó</div><br>  (if He wills, He can destroy you, and in your place make whom He wills as your successors, as He raised you from the seed of other people) (6:133),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóáóßõãú ÎóáóÜÆöİó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÑóİóÚó ÈóÚúÖóßõãú İóæúŞó ÈóÚúÖò ÏóÑóÌóÜÊò</div><br>  (And it is He Who has made you generations coming after generations, replacing each other on the earth.

(2:30) meaning, people who will come after one another, as we have already stated. Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÌúÚóáõßõãú ÍõáóİóÂÁó ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (and makes you inheritors of the earth,) means, nation after nation, generation after generation, people after people. If He had willed, He could have created them all at one time, and not made some of them the offspring of others. If He had willed, He could have created them all together, as He created Adam from dust. If He had willed, He could have made some of them the offspring of others, but not caused any of them to die until they all died at one time; in this case the earth would have become constricted for them and it would be too difficult for them to live and earn a living, and they would have caused inconvenience and harm to one another. But His wisdom and decree ruled that they should be created from one soul, then their numbers should be greatly increased, so He created them on the earth and made them generation after generation, nation after nation, until their time will come to an end and there will be no one left on earth, as Allah has decreed and as He has completely counted out their numbers. Then the Resurrection will come to pass, and each person will be rewarded or punished according to his deeds.
