Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "(Allah said) I have prohibited for you seven types of relatives by blood and seven by marriage.'' Ibn `Abbas then recited the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍõÑøöãóÊú Úóáóíúßõãú ÃõãøóåóÜÊõßõãú æóÈóäóÜÊõßõãú æóÃóÎóæóÊõßõãú</div><br>  (Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters...)  At-Tabari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, "Seven degrees of blood relation and seven degrees of marriage relation are prohibited (for marriage).''

Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded that `A'ishah, the Mother of the Faithful, said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÑøóÖóÇÚóÉó ÊõÍóÑøöãõ ãóÇ ÊõÍóÑøöãõ ÇáúæöáóÇÏóÉ»</div><br>  (Suckling prohibits what birth prohibits.)

In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that `A'ishah said, "Among the parts of the Qur'an that were revealed, is the statement, `Ten incidents of suckling establishes the prohibition (concerning marriage).' It was later abrogated with five, and the Messenger of Allah died while this statement was still recited as part of the Qur'an.''' A Hadith that Sahlah bint Suhayl narrated states that the Messenger of Allah ordered her to suckle Salim the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah with five.'' We should assert that the suckling mentioned here must occur before the age of two, as we stated when we explained the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÑúÖöÚúäó ÃóæúáóÜÏóåõäøó Íóæúáóíúäö ßóÇãöáóíúäö áöãóäú ÃóÑóÇÏó Ãóä íõÊöãøó ÇáÑøóÖóÇÚóÉó</div><br>  ((The mothers) should suckle their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling) 2:233.

As for the wife's daughter, she becomes prohibited for her stepfather when he has sexual relations with her mother, after the marriage contract is ratified. If the man divorces the mother before having sexual relations with her, he is allowed to marry her daughter.

Therefore, no one is allowed to take or keep two sisters as rival wives, according to the consensus of the scholars of the Companions, their followers, and the Imams of old and present. They all stated that taking two sisters as rival wives is prohibited, and that whoever embraces Islam while married to two sisters at the same time is given the choice to keep one of them and divorce the other. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ad-Dahhak bin Fayruz said that his father said, "I embraced Islam while married to two sisters at the same time and the Prophet commanded me to divorce one of them.''  </div></body></html>
