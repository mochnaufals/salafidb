He tells us that everything that has a shadow leaning to the right and the left, i.e., in the morning and the evening, is by its shadow, prostrating to Allah. Mujahid said, "When the sun passes its zenith, everything prostrates to Allah, may He be glorified.'' This was also said by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöáøóåö æóåõãú</div><br>  (while they are humble) means, they are in a state of humility. Mujahid also said: "The prostration of every thing is its shadow'', and he mentioned the mountains and said that their prostrations are their shadows. Abu Ghalib Ash-Shaybani said: "The waves of the sea are its prayers''. It is as if reason is attributed to these inanimate objects when they are described as prostrating, so Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáöáøóåö íóÓúÌõÏõ ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ãöä ÏóÂÈøóÉò</div><br>  (And to Allah prostrate all that are in the heavens and all that are in the earth, of the moving creatures) As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóááøóåö íóÓúÌõÏõ ãóä İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö ØóæúÚğÇ æóßóÑúåğÇ æóÙöáóÜáõåõã ÈöÇáúÛõÏõæøö æóÇáÇøñÕóÇáö </div><br>  (And to Allah (alone) all who are in the heavens and the earth fall in prostration, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons.)
