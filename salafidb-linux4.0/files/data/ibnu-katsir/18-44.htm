What is meant is that what this disbeliever was afraid of and what the believer had terrified him actually had happened. A storm struck his garden, a garden which he had erroneously thought would last forever, distracting him from thoughts of Allah, may He be glorified.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÕúÈóÍó íõŞóáøöÈõ ßóİøóíúåö Úóáóì ãóÂ ÃóäúİóŞó İöíåóÇ</div><br>  (And he began Yuqallibu his hands over what he had spent upon it,) Qatadah said: "He was clasping his hands together in a gesture of regret and grief for the wealth he had lost.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõ íáóíúÊóäöì áóãú ÃõÔúÑößú ÈöÑóÈøöì ÃóÍóÏğÇæóáóãú Êóßõä áøóåõ İöÆóÉñ</div><br>  (and he could only say: "Would that I had ascribed no partners to my Lord!"

There, Al-Walayah will be for Allah, the True God.) Here there are differences in recitation. Some of the reciters pause at the word there,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó ãõäúÊóÕöÑÇğåõäóÇáößó</div><br>  (nor could he defend himself there. ), i.e., at that time, when Allah sends the punishment upon him, there will be no one to save him. Then they start the next phrase with Al-Walayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúæóáóÜíóÉõ áöáøóåö ÇáúÍóŞøö</div><br>  (Al-Walayah will be for Allah, the True God.)

There is a further difference in the recitation of the word Al-Walayah. Some read it as Al-Walayah, which gives the meaning that all allegiance will be to Allah, i.e., on that Day everyone, believer or disbeliever, will return to Allah, for allegiance and submission to Him when the punishment comes to pass. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÑóÃóæúÇú ÈóÃúÓóäóÇ ŞóÇáõæÇú ÁóÇãóäøóÇ ÈöÇááøóåö æóÍúÏóåõ æóßóÜİóÑúäóÇ ÈöãóÇ ßõäøóÇ Èöåö ãõÔúÑößöíäó </div><br>  (So when they saw Our punishment, they said: "We believe in Allah Alone and reject (all) that we used to associate with Him as partners.'') 40:84 and Allah says concerning the Fir`awn;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÇæóÒúäóÇ ÈöÈóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó ÇáúÈóÍúÑó İóÃóÊúÈóÚóåõãú İöÑúÚóæúäõ æóÌõäõæÏõåõ ÈóÛúíğÇ æóÚóÏúæğÇ ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÂ ÃóÏúÑóßóåõ ÇáúÛóÑóŞõ ŞóÇáó ÁóÇãóäÊõ Ãóäøóåõ áÇ ÅöáöÜåó ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöì ÁóÇãóäóÊú Èöåö ÈóäæÇú ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó æóÃóäóÇú ãöäó ÇáúãõÓúáöãöíäó - ÁóÇáóäó æóŞóÏú ÚóÕóíúÊó ŞóÈúáõ æóßõäÊó ãöäó ÇáúãõİúÓöÏöíäó </div><br>  (Till when drowning overtook him, he said: "I believe that none has the right to be worshipped but He in Whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am one of the Muslims.'' Now! While you refused to believe before and you were one of the mischief-makers.) 10:90-91 Some others read it as Al-Wilayah, meaning that on that Day the rule will belong to Allah, the True God. Some read Haqqu (True) refering to Al-Wilayah, as in the Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çáúãõáúßõ íóæúãóÆöĞò ÇáúÍóŞøõ áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö æóßóÇäó íóæúãÇğ Úóáóì ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ÚóÓöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty), belonging to the Most Gracious (Allah), and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers) 25:26.
