"Everything is from Allah, and that is a Name from His Names. So it all comes from Him without rivals to dispute His authority; surely, this fact is completely certain.''

In the beginning of Islam, Muslims were ordered to observe patience in the face of the oppression of the idolators and the People of the Scriptures so that their hearts may incline towards Islam. However, when the disbelievers persisted in stubbornness, Allah legislated for the believers to fight in Jihad. Statements of this meaning were collected from `Abdullah bin `Abbas and Qatadah. Mujahid said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íóÑúÌõæäó ÃóíøóÇãó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (those who hope not for the Days of Allah,) "They do not appreciate Allah's favors.''

Then, He will recompense you for your deeds, good for good and evil for evil.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú ÁóÇÊóíúäóÇ Èóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó æóÇáúÍõßúãó æóÇáäøõÈõæøóÉó æóÑóÒóŞúäóÜåõãú ãøöäó ÇáØøóíøöÈóÜÊö æóİóÖøóáúäóÜåõãú Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÜáóãíäó - æóÁÇÊóíúäóÜåõã ÈóíøöäóÜÊò ãøöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö İóãóÇ ÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇú ÅöáÇøó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö ãóÇ ÌóÂÁóåõãõ ÇáúÚöáúãõ ÈóÛúíÇğ Èóíúäóåõãú Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó íóŞúÖöì Èöíúäóåõãú íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö İöíãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú İöíåö íóÎúÊóáöİõæäó - Ëõãøó ÌóÚóáúäóÜßó Úóáóì ÔóÑöíÚóÉò ãøöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö İóÇÊøóÈöÚúåóÇ æóáÇó ÊóÊøóÈöÚú ÃóåúæóÂÁó ÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  </div></body></html>
