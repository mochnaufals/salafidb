Verily, they are a host to be drowned.) When Musa and the Children of Israel has crossed the sea, Musa wanted to strike it with his staff so that it would go back as it had been, and it would form a barrier between then and Fir`awn and prevent him from reaching them. But Allah commanded him to leave it as it was, quiet and divided, and gave him the glad tidings that they were a host to be drowned, and that he should not fear either being overtaken by Fir`awn or drowning in the sea.

Mujahid said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóåúæÇğ</div><br>  (as it is) means, a dry path, as it is. `Do not command it to go back; leave it until the last of them have entered it.' This was also the view of `Ikrimah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ibn Zayd, Ka`b Al-Ahbar, Simak bin Harb and others.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóãú ÊóÑóßõæÇú ãöä ÌóäøóÜÊò æóÚõíõæäò æóÒõÑõæÚò</div><br>  (How many of gardens and springs that they left behind.

Muja0hid and Sa 0d bin Jubayr said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóŞóÇãò ßóÑöíãò</div><br>  (and goodly places,) means elevated places.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÚúãóÉò ßóÇäõæÇú İöíåóÇ İóÜßöåöíäó </div><br>  (And comforts of life wherein they used to take delight!) means, a life which they were enjoying, where they could eat whatever they wanted and wear what they liked, with wealth and glory and power in the land. Then all of that was taken away in a single morning, they departed from this world and went to Hell, what a terrible abode!   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞóáößó æóÃóæúÑóËúäóÜåóÇ ŞóæúãÇğ ÁóÇÎóÑöíäó </div><br>  (Thus (it was)!

So they did not deserve to be given a respite, because of their disbelief, sin, transgression and stubbornness. Ibn Jarir recorded that Sa`id bin Jubayr said, "A man came to Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and said to him: `O Abu Al-`Abbas, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ÈóßóÊú Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáÓøóãóÂÁõ æóÇáÇøñÑúÖõ æóãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú ãõäÙóÑöíäó </div><br>  (And the heavens and the earth wept not for them, nor were they given respite) -- do the heavens and the earth weep for anybody' He, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `Yes, there is no one who does not have a gate in the heavens through which his provision comes down and his good deeds ascend. When the believer dies, that gate is closed; it misses him and weeps for him, and the place of prayer on earth where he used to pray and remember Allah also weeps for him. But the people of Fir`awn left no trace of righteousness on the earth and they had no good deeds that ascended to Allah, so the heavens and the earth did not weep for them.''' Al-`Awfi reported something similar from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú äóÌøóíúäóÇ Èóäöì ÅöÓúÑóÁöíáó ãöäó ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö Çáúãõåöíäö - ãöä İöÑúÚóæúäó Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÚóÇáöíÇğ ãøöäó ÇáúãõÓúÑöİöíäó </div><br>  (And indeed We saved the Children of Israel from the humiliating torment from Fir`awn; verily, he was arrogant and was of the excessive. ) Here Allah reminds them of how He saved them from their humiliation and subjugation at the hands of Fir`awn, when they were forced to do menial tasks.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä İöÑúÚóæúäó Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó ÚóÇáöíÇğ</div><br>  (From Fir`awn; verily, he was arrogant) means, he was proud and stubborn.

(3:42), i.e., Maryam was chosen above the women of her time. For Khadijah, may Allah be pleased with her, is higher than her in status or is equal to her, as was Asiyah bint Muzahim, the wife of Fir`awn. And the superiority of `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, over all other women is like the superiority of Tharid over all other dishes.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóíúäóÜåõã ãøöäó ÇáÇøñíóÜÊö</div><br>  (And granted them signs) means clear proofs and extraordinary evidence.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ İöíåö ÈóáóÄñÇú ãøõÈöíäñ</div><br>  (in which there was a plain trial.) means, an obvious test to show who would be guided by it.  </div></body></html>
