Allah explains that when any hardship befalls man, after he has experienced blessings, he is disheartened and he despairs of any good in the future. He denies and rejects (the bounties of) his previous condition. Thus, he behaves as if he has never seen any good and he loses all hope for relief (from his situation). Likewise, if any blessing befalls him after displeasure,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíóŞõæáóäøó ĞóåóÈó ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÇÊõ Úóäøöí</div><br>  (he is sure to say, "Ills have departed from me.'') This means that he will claim that no harm or calamity will afflict him after this (blessing).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ áóİóÑöÍñ İóÎõæÑñ</div><br>  (Surely, he is exultant and boastful (ungrateful to Allah).) This means that he is pleased with what he has in his hand and ungrateful (to Allah). At the same time he is boastful towards others. Allah, the Exalted, then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÕóÈóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (Except those who show patience) meaning, those who show patience during times of hardship and adversity. In reference to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÇÊö</div><br>  (and do righteous good deeds) This means that they perform the good deeds in times of ease and good health. Concerning the statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó áóåõãú ãøóÛúİöÑóÉñ</div><br>  (those, theirs will be forgiveness) meaning, that they will be forgiven due to the calamities that afflicted them. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÌúÑñ ßóÈöíÑñ</div><br>  (and a great reward.) This great reward is due to them because of what they sent forth (of good deeds) in their times of ease. This is similar to what is mentioned in the Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö áóÇ íõÕöíÈõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäó åóãøñ æóáóÇ Ûóãøñ æóáóÇ äóÕóÈñ æóáóÇ æóÕóÈñ æóáóÇ ÍóÒóäñ¡ ÍóÊøóì ÇáÔøóæúßóÉõ íõÔóÇßõåóÇ ÅöáøóÇ ßóİøóÑó Çááåõ Úóäúåõ ÈöåóÇ ãöäú ÎóØóÇíóÇå»</div><br>  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! No worry, calamity, distress, illness, or grief strikes a believer, even the prick of a thorn, except that Allah will expiate his sins for him because of it.) In the Sahih it is recorded that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö áóÇ íóŞúÖöí Çááåõ áöáúãõÄúãöäö ŞóÖóÇÁğ ÅöáøóÇ ßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóåõ¡ Åöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóÊúåõ ÓóÑøóÇÁõ İóÔóßóÑó ßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóåõ¡ æóÅöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóÊúåõ ÖóÑøóÇÁõ İóÕóÈóÑó ßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóåõ¡ æóáóíúÓó Ğóáößó áöÃóÍóÏò ÛóíúÑö ÇáúãõÄúãöä»</div><br>  (By He in Whose Hand is my soul! Allah does not decree any matter for the believer except that it is good for him. If any blessing befalls him, he is thankful (to Allah) and that is good for him. If any harm comes to him, he is patient and that is also good for him. This is (a bounty) exclusively for the believer.) For this reason, Allah, the Exalted, says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÚóÕúÑö - Åöäøó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó áóİöì ÎõÓúÑò - ÅöáÇøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÕøóÜáöÍóÜÊö æóÊóæóÇÕóæúÇú ÈöÇáúÍóŞøö æóÊóæóÇÕóæúÇú ÈöÇáÕøóÈúÑö </div><br>  (By Al-`Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss. Except those who believe and do righteous good deeds. And recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another to patience.) 103:1-3 Allah also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ÎõáöŞó åóáõæÚÇğ </div><br>  (Verily, man was created very impatient.) 70:19  </div></body></html>
