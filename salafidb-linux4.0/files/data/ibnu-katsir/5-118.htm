Al-Bukhari also recorded this Hadith in the explanation of this Ayah.  Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöä ÊõÚóĞøöÈúåõãú İóÅöäøóåõãú ÚöÈóÇÏõßó æóÅöä ÊóÛúİöÑú áóåõãú İóÅöäøóßó ÃóäÊó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÍóßöíãõ </div><br>  (If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, verily You, only You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.) All matters refer back to Allah, for He does what He Wills and none can question Him about what He does, while He will question them. This Ayah also shows the crime of the Christians who invented a lie against Allah and His Messenger, thus making a rival, wife and son for Allah. Allah is glorified in that He is far above what they attribute to Him. So this Ayah 5:118 has tremendous value and delivers unique news.  </div></body></html>
