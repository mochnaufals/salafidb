He knows their place of dwelling and their place of deposit. This means that He knows where their journeying will end in the earth and where they will seek shelter when they wish to nest. This place of nesting is also considered their place of deposit. `Ali bin Abi Talhah and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑöÒúŞõåóÇ æóíóÚúáóãõ</div><br>  (And He knows its dwelling place) that it means where it resides. In reference to the statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÓúÊóŞóÑøóåóÇ</div><br>  (and its deposit.) he (Ibn `Abbas) said it means where it will die. Allah informs us that all of this is written in a Book with Allah that explains it in detail.
