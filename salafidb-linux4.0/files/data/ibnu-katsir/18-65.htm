So he said to that boy-servant of his:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇ ÃóÈúÑóÍõ</div><br>  (I will not give up) meaning, I will keep on traveling,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÃóÈúáõÛó ãóÌúãóÚó ÇáúÈóÍúÑóíúäö</div><br>  (until I reach the junction of the two seas) meaning, the place where the two seas met.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú ÃóãúÖöìó ÍõŞõÈÇğ</div><br>  (or a Huqub passes.) meaning, even if I have to travel for a very long time. Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him) said, "Some of the scholars of the Arabic language said that Huqub means a year in the dialect of the tribe of Qays,'' then he narrated that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, "Huqub means eighty years.'' Mujahid said, "Seventy years.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said that it means a lifetime. Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said likewise.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÈóáóÛóÇ ãóÌúãóÚó ÈóíúäöåöãóÇ äóÓöíóÇ ÍõæÊóåõãóÇ</div><br>  (But when they reached the junction of the two seas, they forgot their fish,) He had been commanded to carry a salted fish with him, and it had been said to him, when you lose the fish, that will be a sign that you have reached the right place. So they set out and traveled until they reached the junction of the two seas, where there was a spring called `Ayn Al-Hayat (the Spring of Life). They went to sleep there, and the fish felt the drops of that water, so it came back to life. It was in a vessel with Yusha`, upon him be peace, and it jumped out of the vessel towards the sea. Yusha` woke up and the fish fell into the water and started to swim through the water, leaving a track or channel behind it. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÊøóÎóĞó ÓóÈöíáóåõ İöì ÇáúÈóÍúÑö ÓóÑóÈÇğ</div><br>  (and it took its way through the sea as in a tunnel.) meaning, like going through a tunnel on land.

Allah rebuked him because he did not refer the knowledge to Allah. So Allah revealed to him: "At the junction of the two seas there is a servant of Ours who is more learned than you.'' Musa asked, "O my Lord, how can I meet him'' Allah said, "Take a fish and put it in a vessel and then set out, and where you lose the fish, you will find him.'' So Musa took a fish, put it in a vessel and set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha` bin Nun, peace be upon him, till they reached a rock (on which) they both lay down their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the vessel and got out of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was like a tunnel. When Musa got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night.

When they reached the rock, they camped there, and Musa lay down his head and slept. At the base of the rock there was a spring called Al-Hayat; its water never touched a thing but it brought it to life. Some of its water touched the fish, so it began to move and jumped out of the vessel and into the sea. When he woke up, Musa said to his boy-servant: (Bring us our morning meal.)) Then he quoted the rest of the Hadith. Then a bird came and perched on the edge of the ship, and dipped its beak in the sea, and Al-Khidr said to Musa, "My knowledge and your knowledge and the knowledge of all of creation, in comparison to the knowledge of Allah, is like what this bird has taken from the sea.'' Then he mentioned the rest of the report.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó áóåõ ãõæÓóì åóáú ÃóÊøóÈöÚõßó Úóáóì Ãóä ÊõÚóáøöãóäö ãöãøóÇ ÚõáøöãúÊó ÑõÔúÏÇğ - ŞóÇáó Åöäøóßó áóä ÊóÓúÊóØöíÚó ãóÚöìó ÕóÈúÑÇğ - æóßóíúİó ÊóÕúÈöÑõ Úóáóì ãóÇ áóãú ÊõÍöØú Èöåö ÎõÈúÑÇğ </div><br>  </div></body></html>
