Yet, they contradicted these orders, so Allah reminded them of this fact.'' As-Suddi said similarly. Ibn Jurayj said that the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊóÃúãõÑõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓó ÈöÇáúÈöÑøö</div><br>  (Enjoin you Al-Birr on the people) "Is about the People of the Book and the hypocrites. They used to command people to pray and fast. However, they did not practice what they commanded others. Allah reminded them of this behavior. So whoever commands people to do righteousness, let him be among the first of them to implement that command.'' Also, Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóäÓóæúäó ÃóäİõÓóßõãú</div><br>  (And you forget yourselves,) means, "You forget to practice it yourselves,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÊõãú ÊóÊúáõæäó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó ÃóİóáÇó ÊóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (While you recite the Scripture (Tawrah)! Have you then no sense) You forbid the people from rejecting the prophethood and the covenant that you have mentioned with you in the Tawrah, while you yourselves have forgoten it, meaning that `you have forgotten the covenant that I made with you that you will accept My Messenger. You have breeched My covenant, and rejected what you know is in My Book.' ''  Therefore, Allah admonished the Jews for this behavior and alerted them to the wrongs that they were perpetrating against themselves by ordering righteousness, yet refraining themselves from righteousness. We should state that Allah is not criticizing the People of the Book for ordering righteousness, because enjoining good is a part of righteousness and is an obligation for the scholars. However, the scholar is himself required to heed, and adhere to, what he invites others to. For instance, Prophet Shu`ayb said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃõÑöíÏõ Ãóäú ÃõÎóÇáöİóßõãú Åöáóì ãóÂ ÃóäúåóÜßõãú Úóäúåõ Åöäú ÃõÑöíÏõ ÅöáÇøó ÇáÅöÕúáóÜÍó ãóÇ ÇÓúÊóØóÚúÊõ æóãóÇ ÊóæúİöíŞöì ÅöáÇøó ÈöÇááøóåö Úóáóíúåö ÊóæóßøóáúÊõ æóÅöáóíúåö ÃõäöíÈõ</div><br>  (I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you. I only desire reform to the best of my power. And my guidance cannot come except from Allah, in Him I trust and unto Him I repent) (11:88).  Therefore, enjoining righteousness and performing righteousness are both required. Neither category is rendered not necessary by the practice of the other, according to the most correct view of the scholars among the Salaf (predecessors) and the Khalaf.  Imam Ahmad reported that Abu Wa'il said, "While I was riding behind Usamah, he was asked, `Why not advise `Uthman' He said, `Do you think that if I advise him I should allow you to hear it I advise him in secret, and I will not start something that I would hate to be the first to start. I will not say to a man, `You are the best man,' even if he was my leader, after what I heard from the Messenger of Allah .' They said, `What did he say' He said, `I heard him say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÌóÇÁõ ÈöÇáÑøóÌõáö íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãÉö İóíõáúŞóì İöí ÇáäøóÇÑ İóÊóäúÏóáöŞõ Èöå ÃóŞúÊóÇÈõåõ İíóÏõæÑõ ÈöåóÇ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑ ßóãóÇ íóÏõæÑõ ÇáúÍöãóÇÑõ ÈöÑóÍóÇåõ İíõØöíİõ Èöåö Ãóåúáõ ÇáäøóÇÑ İóíóŞõæáõæä: íóÇ İõáóÇäõ ãÇ ÃóÕóÇÈóßó¿ Ãóáóãú Êóßõäú ÊóÃúãõÑõäóÇ ÈöÇáúãóÚúÑõæİ æóÊóäúåóÇäóÇ Úóäö ÇáúãõäúßóÑö¿ İóíóŞõæáõ: ßõäúÊõ ÂãÑõßõãú ÈÇöáúãóÚúÑõæİö æóáóÇ ÂÊöíåö æóÃóäúåóÇßõãú Úóäö ÇáúãõäúßóÑö æóÂÊöíå»</div><br>  (A man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and thrown in the Fire. His intestines will fall out and he will continue circling pulling them behind him, just as the donkey goes around the pole. The people of the Fire will go to that man and ask him, `What happened to you Did you not used to command us to do righteous acts and forbid us from committing evil' He will say, `Yes. I used to enjoin righteousness, but refrained from performing righteousness, and I used to forbid you to perform from evil while I myself did it.').'''  This Hadith was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. eAlso, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, "I hesitate in advising people because of three Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊóÃúãõÑõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓó ÈöÇáúÈöÑøö æóÊóäÓóæúäó ÃóäİõÓóßõãú</div><br>  (Enjoin you Al-Birr on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áöãó ÊóŞõæáõæäó ãóÇ áÇó ÊóİúÚóáõæäó - ßóÈõÑó ãóŞúÊÇğ ÚöäÏó Çááøóåö Ãóä ÊóŞõæáõæÇú ãóÇ áÇó ÊóİúÚóáõæäó </div><br>  (O you who believe!
