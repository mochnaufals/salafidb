Ever since it was revealed, Allah's Messenger used to fight only those who fought him and avoid non-combatants. Later, Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9 in the Qur'an) was revealed.'' `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said similarly, then he said that this was later abrogated by the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇŞúÊõáõæÇú ÇáúãõÔúÑößöíäó ÍóíúËõ æóÌóÏÊøõãõæåõãú</div><br>  (then kill them wherever you find them) (9:5).  However, this statement is not plausible, because Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íõŞóÜÊöáõæäóßõãú</div><br>  (...those who fight you) applies only to fighting the enemies who are engaged in fighting Islam and its people. So the Ayah means, `Fight those who fight you', just as Allah said (in another Ayah):   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇÊöáõæÇú ÇáúãõÔúÑößöíäó ßóÂİøóÉğ ßóãóÇ íõŞóÜÊöáõæäóßõãú ßóÂİøóÉğ</div><br>  (...and fight against the Mushrikin collectively as they fight against you collectively.) (9:36)  This is why Allah said later in the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇŞúÊõáõæåõãú ÍóíúËõ ËóŞöİúÊõãõæåõãú æóÃóÎúÑöÌõæåõãú ãøöäú ÍóíúËõ ÃóÎúÑóÌõæßõãú</div><br>  (And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out.) meaning, `Your energy should be spent on fighting them, just as their energy is spent on fighting you, and on expelling them from the areas from which they have expelled you, as a law of equality in punishment.' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Prohibition of mutilating the Dead and stealing from the captured Goods</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÚúÊóÏõæÇú Åöäøó Çááøóåó áÇó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúãõÚúÊóÏöíäó</div><br>  (but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors.)  This Ayah means, `Fight for the sake of Allah and do not be transgressors,' such as, by committing prohibitions. Al-Hasan Al-Basri stated that transgression (indicated by the Ayah), "includes mutilating the dead, theft (from the captured goods), killing women, children and old people who do not participate in warfare, killing priests and residents of houses of worship, burning down trees and killing animals without real benefit.'' This is also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz, Muqatil bin Hayyan and others. Muslim recorded in his Sahih that Buraydah narrated that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÛúÒõæÇ İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááåö¡ ŞóÇÊöáõæÇ ãóäú ßóİóÑó ÈöÇááåö¡ ÇÛúÒõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÛõáøõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÛúÏöÑõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóãúËõáõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóŞúÊõáõæÇ æóáöíÏğÇ æóáóÇ ÃóÕúÍóÇÈó ÇáÕøóæóÇãöÚ»</div><br>  (Fight for the sake of Allah and fight those who disbelieve in Allah. Fight, but do not steal (from the captured goods), commit treachery, mutilate (the dead), or kill a child, or those who reside in houses of worship.)  It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Ibn `Umar said, "A woman was found dead during one of the Prophet's battles and the Prophet then forbade killing women and children. '' There are many other Hadiths on this subject. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Shirk is worse than Killing</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Since Jihad involves killing and shedding the blood of men, Allah indicated that these men are committing disbelief in Allah, associating with Him (in the worship) and hindering from His path, and this is a much greater evil and more disastrous than killing. Abu Malik commented about what Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúİöÊúäóÉõ ÃóÔóÏøõ ãöäó ÇáúŞóÊúáö</div><br>  (And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.) Meaning what you (disbelievers) are committing is much worse than killing.'' Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that what Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúİöÊúäóÉõ ÃóÔóÏøõ ãöäó ÇáúŞóÊúáö</div><br>  (And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.) "Shirk (polytheism) is worse than killing.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Fighting in the Sacred Area is prohibited, except in Self-Defense</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊõŞóÜÊöáõæåõãú ÚöäÏó ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏö ÇáúÍóÑóÇãö</div><br>  (And fight not with them at Al-Masjid Al-Haram (the sanctuary at Makkah))  It is reported in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åäøó åóĞóÇ ÇáúÈóáóÏó ÍóÑøóãóåõ Çááåõ íóæúãó ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãæóÇÊö æóÇáúÃóÑúÖó¡ İóåõæó ÍóÑóÇãñ ÈöÍõÑúãóÉö Çááåö Åöáì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö¡ æóáóãú íóÍöáøó áöí ÅöáøóÇ ÓóÇÚóÉğ ãöäú äóåóÇÑò¡ æóÅöäøóåóÇ ÓóÇÚóÊöí åĞöåö ÍóÑÇãñ ÈÍõÑúãóÉö Çááåö Åöáì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíÇãóÉö¡ áÇ íõÚúÖóÏõ ÔóÌóÑõåõ¡ æóáóÇ íõÎúÊóáìó ÎóáóÇåõ¡ İóÅöäú ÃóÍóÏñ ÊóÑóÎøóÕó ÈöŞöÊóÇáö ÑóÓõæáö ÇááåöÕáì Çááå Úáíå æÓáøã¡ İóŞõæáõæÇ: Åäøó Çááåó ÃóĞöäó áöÑóÓõæáöåö æóáóãú íóÃúĞóäú áóßõã»</div><br>  (Allah has made this city a sanctuary since the day He created the heavens and the earth. So, it is a sanctuary by Allah's decree till the Day of Resurrection. Fighting in it was made legal for me only for an hour in the daytime. So, it (i.e., Makkah) is a sanctuary, by Allah's decree, from now on until the Day of Resurrection. Its trees should not be cut, and its grass should not be uprooted. If anyone mentions the fighting in it that occurred by Allah's Messenger, then say that Allah allowed His Messenger, but did not allow you.)  In this Hadith, Allah's Messenger mentions fighting the people of Makkah when he conquered it by force, leading to some deaths among the polytheists in the area of the Khandamah. This occurred after the Prophet proclaimed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ÃóÛúáóŞó ÈóÇÈóåõ İåõæó Âãöäñ¡æóãóäú ÏóÎóáó ÇáúãóÓúÌöÏó İóåõæ Âãöäñ¡ æãóäú ÏóÎóáó ÏóÇÑó ÃóÈöí ÓõİúíóÇäó İóåõæó Âãöä»</div><br>  (Whoever closed his door is safe.

But if they attack you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.)  Allah states: `Do not fight them in the area of the Sacred Mosque unless they start fighting you in it. In this case, you are allowed to fight them and kill them to stop their aggression.' Hence, Allah's Messenger took the pledge from his Companions under the tree (in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah) to fight (the polytheists), after the tribes of Quraysh and their allies, Thaqif and other groups, collaborated against the Muslims (to stop them from entering Makkah to visit the Sacred House). Then, Allah stopped the fighting before it started between them and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì ßóİøó ÃóíúÏöíóåõãú Úóäßõãú æóÃóíúÏöíóßõãú Úóäúåõã ÈöÈóØúäö ãóßøóÉó ãöä ÈóÚúÏö Ãóäú ÃóÙúİóÑóßõãú Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (And He it is Who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makkah, after He had made you victors over them.)

(48:25)  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäö ÇäÊóåóæúÇú İóÅöäøó Çááøóåó ÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (But if they cease, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) which means, `If they (polytheists) cease fighting you in the Sacred Area, and come to Islam and repent, then Allah will forgive them their sins, even if they had before killed Muslims in Allah's Sacred Area.' Indeed, Allah's forgiveness encompasses every sin, whatever its enormity, when the sinner repents it. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Order to fight until there is no more Fitnah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah then commanded fighting the disbelievers when He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì áÇó Êóßõæäó İöÊúäóÉñ</div><br>  (...until there is no more Fitnah) meaning, Shirk. This is the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi`, Muqatil bin Hayyan, As-Suddi and Zayd bin Aslam.  Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóßõæäó ÇáÏøöíäõ ááøóåö</div><br>  (...and the religion (all and every kind of worship) is for Allah (Alone).) means, `So that the religion of Allah becomes dominant above all other religions.' It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said: "The Prophet was asked, `O Allah's Messenger! A man fights out of bravery, and another fights to show off, which of them fights in the cause of Allah' The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóäú ŞóÇÊóáó áöÊóßõæäó ßóáöãóÉõ Çááåö åöíó ÇáúÚõáúíÇ İóåõæó İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááå»</div><br>  (He who fights so that Allah's Word is superior, then he fights in Allah's cause.)

Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäö ÇäÊóåóæÇú İóáÇó ÚõÏúæóäó ÅöáÇøó Úóáóì ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against the wrongdoers.) indicates that, `If they stop their Shirk and fighting the believers, then cease warfare against them. Whoever fights them afterwards will be committing an injustice. Verily aggression can only be started against the unjust.' This is the meaning of Mujahid's statement that only combatants should be fought. Or, the meaning of the Ayah indicates that, `If they abandon their injustice, which is Shirk in this case, then do not start aggression against them afterwards.' The aggression here means retaliating and fighting them, just as Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóäö ÇÚúÊóÏóì Úóáóíúßõãú İóÇÚúÊóÏõæÇú Úóáóíúåö ÈöãöËúáö ãóÇ ÇÚúÊóÏóì Úóáóíúßõãú</div><br>  (Then whoever transgresses against you, you transgress likewise against him.)

Hence, what prevents you from going out'' He said, "What prevents me is that Allah has for bidden shedding the blood of my (Muslim) brother.'' They said, "Did not Allah say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÜÊöáõæåõãú ÍóÊøóì áÇó Êóßõæäó İöÊúäóÉñ</div><br>  (And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah))'' He said, "We did fight until there was no more Fitnah and the religion became for Allah Alone. You want to fight until there is Fitnah and the religion becomes for other than Allah!''  `Uthman bin Salih added that a man came to Ibn `Umar and asked him, "O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! What made you perform Hajj one year and `Umrah another year and abandon Jihad in the cause of Allah, although you know how much He has encouraged performing it'' He said, "O my nephew! Islam is built on five (pillars): believing in Allah and His Messenger, the five daily prayers, fasting Ramadan, paying the Zakah and performing Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House.'' They said, "O Abu `Abdur-Rahman!

However, you hated the fact that Allah had forgiven him! As for `Ali, he is the cousin of Allah's Messenger and his son-in-law.'' He then pointed with his hand, saying, "This is where his house is located (meaning, `so close to the Prophet's house just as `Ali was so close to the Prophet himself').''  </div></body></html>
