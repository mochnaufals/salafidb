The vivid flash of its (clouds) lightning nearly blinds the sight.) (44. Allah causes the night and the day to succeed each other.

This is the "Gentle driving.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó íõÄóáøöİõ Èóíúäóåõ</div><br>  (then joins them together,) means, He brings them together after they have been scattered.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó íóÌúÚóáõåõ ÑõßóÇãÇğ</div><br>  (then makes them into a heap of layers,) means, He piles them up on top of one another.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÊóÑóì ÇáúæóÏúŞó</div><br>  (and you see the Wadq) meaning the rain,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÎúÑõÌõ ãöäú ÎöáÇóáöåö</div><br>  (come forth from between them;) means, from the gaps between them. This is how it was understood by Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak. `Ubayd bin `Umayr Al-Laythi said: "Allah sends the scatterer wind, which stirs up that which is on the surface of the earth. Then he sends the generator wind, which forms the clouds. Then He sends the joiner wind which brings them together. Then He sends the fertilizer wind which fertilizes or `seeds' the clouds.'' This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõäóÒøöáõ ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ãöä ÌöÈóÇáò İöíåóÇ ãöä ÈóÑóÏò</div><br>  (and He sends down from Min the sky, from Min mountains in it of Min ice,) Some of the grammarians said that the first Min describes the place from which it is coming, the second specifies from which part of the sky it comes, and the third means some kind of mountains. This is based on the view of those scholars of Tafsir who say that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãöä ÌöÈóÇáò İöíåóÇ ãöä ÈóÑóÏò</div><br>  (from Min mountains in it of Min ice) means that there are mountains of hail in the sky from which Allah sends down ice. As for those who say that "mountains'' here is used as a metaphor for clouds, they think that the second Min is also used to describe the place from which the ice is coming, and is thus interchangeable with the first. And Allah knows best.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíõÕöíÈõ Èöåö ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ æóíóÕúÑöİõåõ Úóä ãøóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (and strikes therewith whom He wills, and averts it from whom He wills.) It may be that the phrase   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíõÕöíÈõ Èöåö</div><br>  (and strikes therewith) means, with what He sends down from the sky of different kinds of rain and hail. So then the phrase   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíõÕöíÈõ Èöåö ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (and strikes therewith whom He wills) means, by His mercy towards them, and   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÕúÑöİõåõ Úóä ãøóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (and averts it from whom He wills. ) means, He withholds rain from them. Or it may be that   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóíõÕöíÈõ Èöåö</div><br>  (and strikes therewith) means, with hail, as a punishment towards whomever He wills, striking their fruits and destroying their crops and trees. And He averts it from whomever He wills as a mercy towards them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóßóÇÏõ ÓóäóÇ ÈóÑúŞöåö íóĞúåóÈõ ÈöÇáÇøñÈúÕóÜÑö</div><br>  (The vivid flash of its lightning nearly blinds the sight.) the brightness of its lightning almost takes away their sight if the eyes follow it and try to look at it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõŞóáøöÈõ Çááøóåõ Çáøóíúáó æóÇáäøóåóÇÑó</div><br>  (Allah causes the night and the day to succeed each other.) He is controlling them, so that He takes something from the length of one and adds it to the other, which is short, until they become equal, then He does the opposite so that the one which was short becomes long and vice versa. Allah is the One Who is controlling that by His command, power, might and knowledge.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áóÚöÈúÑóÉğ áÇæúáöì ÇáÇøñÈúÕóÜÑö</div><br>  (Truly, in this is indeed a lesson for those who have insight.) means, this is an indication of His greatness, may He be exalted. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöì ÎóáúŞö ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóÇÎúÊöáóÜİö Çáøóíúáö æóÇáäøóåóÇÑö áÇøíóÜÊò áÇøñæúáöì ÇáÇøñáúÈóÜÈö </div><br>  (Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding.) 3:190 and thereafter.  </div></body></html>
