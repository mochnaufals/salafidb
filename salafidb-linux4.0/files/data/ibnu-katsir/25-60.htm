They do this with no evidence or proof; the only thing that led them to do this was their own whims and desires. So they take these idols as protectors and fight for their sake, and they oppose Allah and His Messenger and the believers for their sake. Similarly Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÇáúßóÜİöÑõ Úóáóì ÑóÈøöåö ÙóåöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (and the disbeliever is ever a helper against his Lord.) meaning, he is a supporter of Shaytan against the party of Allah, but the party of Allah are the ones who will prevail, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóÎóĞõæÇú ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö ÁóÇáöåóÉğ áøóÚóáøóåõãú íõäÕóÑõæäó - áÇó íóÓúÊóØöíÚõæäó äóÕúÑóåõãú æóåõãú áóåõãú ÌõäÏñ ãøñÍúÖóÑõæäó </div><br>  (And they have taken besides Allah gods, hoping that they might be helped. They cannot help them, but they will be brought forward as a troop against those who worshipped them.) (36:74-75) meaning, the gods which they worshipped instead of Allah cannot help them. These ignorant people are troops for the idols and are ready to fight for their sake and protect their sanctuaries, but in the end the victory will be for Allah and His Messenger and the believers, in this world and the Hereafter.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÇáúßóÜİöÑõ Úóáóì ÑóÈøöåö ÙóåöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (and the disbeliever is ever a helper against his Lord. ) Mujahid said: "He supports and helps the Shaytan in disobedience towards Allah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Messenger brings Glad Tidings and Warnings</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah tells His Messenger:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÂ ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÜßó ÅöáÇøó ãõÈóÔøöÑÇğ æóäóĞöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (And We have sent you only as a bearer of good news and a warner.) meaning, a bringer of good news to the believers, a warner to the disbelievers; bringing good news of Paradise to those who obey Allah, and bringing warnings of a dreadful punishment for those who go against the commandments of Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ãóÂ ÃóÓúÃóáõßõãú Úóáóíúåö ãöäú ÃóÌúÑò</div><br>  (Say: "No reward do I ask of you for this...'') `for conveying this message and this warning, I do not ask for any reward from your wealth; I am only doing this for the sake of Allah, may He be exalted.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöãóä ÔóÂÁó ãöäßõãú Ãóä íóÓúÊóŞöíãó </div><br>  (To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight) (81:28).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ãóä ÔóÂÁó Ãóä íóÊøóÎöĞó Åöáóì ÑóÈøöåö ÓóÈöíáÇğ</div><br>  (save that whosoever wills, may take a path to his Lord.) means, a way and a methodology to be followed. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to the Messenger to put his Trust in Allah, and some of His Qualities</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóæóßøóáú Úóáóì ÇáúÍóìøö ÇáøóĞöì áÇó íóãõæÊõ</div><br>  (And put your trust in the Ever Living One Who dies not,) meaning, in all your affairs, put your trust in Allah, the Ever-Living Who never dies, the One Who   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáÇøñæøóáõ æóÇáÇøñÎöÑõ æóÇáÙøóÜåöÑõ æóÇáúÈóÜØöäõ æóåõæó Èößõáøö ÔóìúÁò Úóáöíãñ</div><br>  (is the First and the Last, the Most High and the Most Near. And He is the All-Knower of everything) (57:3). The Eternal, Ever-Lasting, Ever-Living, Self-Sufficient One, the Lord and Sovereign of all things, the One to Whom you should always turn. Allah is the One in Whom you should put your trust and to Whom you should turn for refuge, He will be sufficient for you and will be your helper and supporter, and will cause you to prevail. As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáÑøóÓõæáõ ÈóáøöÛú ãóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúßó ãöä ÑøóÈøößó æóÅöä áøóãú ÊóİúÚóáú İóãóÇ ÈóáøóÛúÊó ÑöÓóÇáóÊóåõ æóÇááøóåõ íóÚúÕöãõßó ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (O Messenger! Proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind) (5:67).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÓóÈøöÍú ÈöÍóãúÏöåö</div><br>  (and glorify His praises,) means, combine praising Him with glorifying Him. Hence the Messenger of Allah used to say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÓõÈúÍóÇäóßó Çááøóåõãøó ÑóÈøóäóÇ æóÈöÍóãúÏöß»</div><br>  (Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise.) So the Ayah means: be sincere in worshipping Him and putting your trust in Him. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøóÈøõ ÇáúãóÔúÑöŞö æóÇáúãóÛúÑöÈö áÇó ÅöáóÜåó ÅöáÇøó åõæó İóÇÊøóÎöĞúåõ æóßöíáÇğ </div><br>  (The Lord of the east and the west; there is no God but He. So take Him as a Trustee.) (73:9)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúÈõÏúåõ æóÊóæóßøóáú Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (So worship Him and put your trust in Him) (11:123).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Èöåö æóÚóáóíúåö ÊóæóßøóáúäóÇ</div><br>  (Say: "He is the Most Gracious, in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust.'') (67:29)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóİóì Èöåö ÈöĞõäõæÈö ÚöÈóÇÏöåö ÎóÈöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (and sufficient is He as the All-Knower of the sins of His servants) means, by His perfect knowledge nothing is hidden from Him nor can anything be hidden from Him, not even a speck of dust's weight.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖó</div><br>  (Who created the heavens and the earth...) means, He is the Ever-Living Who never dies, He is the Creator, Sustainer and Sovereign of all things, Who by His might and power created the seven heavens with their vast height and width, and the seven earths with their great depths and density.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöí ÓöÊøóÉö ÃóíøóÇãò Ëõãøó ÇÓúÊóæóì Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÑúÔö</div><br>  (in six Days. Then He rose over the Throne.) means, He is running all affairs and He decrees according to the truth, and He is the best of those who decide.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÇÓúÊóæóì Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÑúÔö ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ İóÇÓúÃóáú Èöåö ÎóÈöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (Then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne. The Most Gracious! Ask Him, as He is the All-Knower.) meaning, find out about Him from one who knows most about Him, and follow him and take him as your example. It is known that there is no one who knows more about Allah than His servant and Messenger Muhammad , the absolute leader of the sons of Adam in this world and the Hereafter, who does not speak of his own desire, but conveys revelation revealed to him. What he says is true, and he is the leader whose decision counts; when there is a dispute, people are obliged to refer to him, and whatever is in accordance with his words and deeds is right, and whatever goes against them should be rejected no matter who says or does it. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöä ÊóäóÇÒóÚúÊõãú İöì ÔóìúÁò</div><br>  ((And) if you differ in anything among yourselves...) (4:59).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÇÎúÊóáóİúÊõãú İöíåö ãöä ÔóìúÁò İóÍõßúãõåõ Åöáóì Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allah) (42:10).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóãøóÊú ßóáöãóÉõ ÑóÈøößó ÕöÏúŞÇğ æóÚóÏúáÇğ</div><br>  (And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice) (6: 115). meaning, He has spoken the truth and is fair and just in His commands and prohibitions. Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÓúÃóáú Èöåö ÎóÈöíÑÇğ</div><br>  (Ask Him, as He is Al-Knower.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Condemnation of the Idolators</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah rebukes the idolators who prostrate to idols and rivals instead of Allah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ Şöíáó áóåõãõ ÇÓúÌõÏõæÇú áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ŞóÇáõæÇú æóãóÇ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ</div><br>  (And when it is said to them: "Prostrate yourselves to Ar-Rahman!'' They say: "And what is Ar-Rahman'') meaning: we do not know Ar-Rahman. They did not like to call Allah by His Name Ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), as they objected on the day of (the treaty of) Al-Hudaybiyyah, when the Prophet told the scribe:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇßúÊõÈú ÈöÓúãö Çááåö ÇáÑøóÍúãäö ÇáÑøóÍöíã»</div><br>  (Write: "In the Name of Allah, Ar-Rahman (the Most Gracious), Ar-Rahim (the Most Merciful).'') They said, "We do not know Ar-Rahman or Ar-Rahim. Write what you used to write: `Bismika Allahumma (in Your Name, O Allah).''' So Allah revealed the words:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáö ÇÏúÚõæÇú Çááøóåó Ãóæö ÇÏúÚõæÇú ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäó ÃóíøğÇ ãøóÇ ÊóÏúÚõæÇú İóáóåõ ÇáÇøñÓúãóÂÁó ÇáúÍõÓúäóì</div><br>  (Say: "Invoke Allah or invoke Ar-Rahman, by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), for to Him belong the Best Names) (17:110). meaning, He is Allah and He is the Most Gracious. And in this Ayah, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ Şöíáó áóåõãõ ÇÓúÌõÏõæÇú áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö ŞóÇáõæÇú æóãóÇ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ</div><br>  (And when it is said to them: "Prostrate yourselves to Ar-Rahman!'' They say: "And what is the Ar-Rahman'') meaning: we do not know or approve of this Name.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóäóÓúÌõÏõ áöãóÇ ÊóÃúãõÑõäóÇ</div><br>  (Shall we fall down in prostration to that which you command us) means, "Just because you tell us to''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÒóÇÏóåõãú äõİõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (And it increases in them only aversion.) As for the believers, they worship Allah Who is the Most Gracious, Most Merciful, and they attribute divinity to Him Alone and prostrate to Him. The scholars, agree that it is allowed and approved for the reader and the listener to prostrate when he reaches this mention of prostration in Surat Al-Furqan, and Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
