Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the Ayat of the Most Gracious were recited unto them, they fell down prostrate and weeping.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>These Prophets are the Chosen Ones</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah, the Exalted, says that these Prophets (were favored), but this does not mean only these Prophets who were mentioned in this Surah. Rather, it is referring to all of those who were Prophets. Allah merely changes the implication of the discussion from specific individuals to the entire group of Prophets.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃóäúÚóãó Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåöã ãøöäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíúäó ãöä ĞõÑøöíøóÉö ÁÇÏóãó</div><br>  (they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam.) As-Suddi and Ibn Jarir both said, "That which is meant by the offspring of Adam is Idris, and what is meant by the offspring of those `whom We carried with Nuh' is Ibrahim, and what is meant by the offspring of Ibrahim is Ishaq, Ya`qub and Isma`il, and what is meant by the offspring of Isra`il is Musa, Harun, Zakariyya, Yayha and `Isa bin Maryam.'' Ibn Jarir said, "And that is the distinction of their genealogies, even though Adam gathers all of them (as their original father). This is because among them is he who was not a descendant of those who were on the ship with Nuh, and he that is Idris. For verily, he was the grandfather of Nuh.'' I say that this is the most apparent meaning, which concludes that Idris is amongst the pillars of Nuh's ancestral lineage. The view that this Ayah refers to the ancestral lineage of the Prophets, is the fact that it is similar to Allah's statement in Surah Al-An`am,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊöáúßó ÍõÌøóÊõäóÂ ÁóÇÊóíúäóÜåóÂ ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó Úóáóì Şóæúãöåö äóÑúİóÚõ ÏóÑóÌóÜÊò ãøóä äøóÔóÂÁõ Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó Íóßöíãñ Úóáöíãñ - æóæóåóÈúäóÇ áóåõ ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóíóÚúŞõæÈó ßõáÇøğ åóÏóíúäóÇ æóäõæÍÇğ åóÏóíúäóÇ ãöä ŞóÈúáõ æóãöä ĞõÑøöíøóÊöåö ÏóÇæõæÏó æóÓõáóíúãóÜäó æóÃóíøõæÈó æóíõæÓõİó æóãõæÓóì æóåóÜÑõæäó æóßóĞóáößó äóÌúÒöì ÇáúãõÍúÓöäöíäó - æóÒóßóÑöíøóÇ æóíóÍúíóì æóÚöíÓóì æóÅöáúíóÇÓó ßõáøñ ãøöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó - æóÅöÓúãóÜÚöíáó æóÇáúíóÓóÚó æóíõæäõÓó æóáõæØÇğ æóßõáÇøğ İóÖøóáúäóÇ Úóáóì ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó - æóãöäú ÁÇÈóÇÆöåöãú æóĞõÑøöíøóÜÊöåöãú æóÅöÎúæóäöåöãú æóÇÌúÊóÈóíúäóÜåõãú æóåóÏóíúäóÜåõãú Åöáóì ÕöÑóØò ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò </div><br>  (And that was our proof which We gave Ibrahim against his people.

This means that when they heard the Words of Allah, mentioning His proofs and evidences, they prostrated to their Lord in humility, humbleness, praise and thanks for the great favors they were blessed with. The word Bukiyan at the end of the Ayah means those who are crying, and it is the plural of Baki. Due to this the scholars agree that it is legislated to prostrate upon reading this Ayah, in following them and adhering to their manner of worship.  </div></body></html>
