No doubt, whoever does that, Allah will have mercy on him, as Allah says in another Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÓóíóÑúÍóãõåõãõ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (Allah will have His mercy on them) 9:71   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó ÊóÍúÓóÈóäøó</div><br>  (Consider not) means, `do not think, O Muhammad,' that:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (the disbelievers) meaning, those who opposed and denied you,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÚúÌöÒöíäó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (can escape in the land.) means, that they can flee from Allah. No, Allah is able to deal with them and He will punish them most severely for that. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÃúæóÇåõãõ</div><br>  (Their abode) meaning, in the Hereafter,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáäøóÇÑõ æóáóÈöÆúÓó ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ</div><br>  (shall be the Fire -- and worst indeed is that destination.) means, how terrible the consequences will be for the disbelievers, how evil a place to stay in and how awful a place to rest!  </div></body></html>
