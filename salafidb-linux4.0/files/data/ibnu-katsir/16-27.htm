Others said that it refers to Bukhtanassar (Nebuchadnezzar). The correct view is that this is said by way of example, to refute what was done by those who disbelieved in Allah and associated others in worship with Him. As Nuh said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóßóÑõæÇú ãóßúÑÇğ ßõÈøóÇÑÇğ </div><br>  ("And they have hatched a mighty scheme.'') (71:22) meaning, they used all sorts of ploys to misguide their people, and tempted them to join them in their Shirk via all possible means. On the Day of Resurrection their followers will say to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ãóßúÑõ Çáøóíúáö æóÇáäøóåóÇÑö ÅöĞú ÊóÃúãõÑõæäóäóÂ Ãóä äøóßúİõÑó ÈöÇááøóåö æóäóÌúÚóáó áóåõ ÃóäÏóÇÏÇğ</div><br>  ("Nay, but it was your plotting by night and day, when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and set up rivals to Him!'')

Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them) 16:26-27 meaning, He will expose their scandalous deeds and what they used to hide in their hearts, and He will bring it out in the open. As He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊõÈúáóì ÇáÓøóÑóÂÆöÑõ </div><br>  (The Day when all the secrets will be (exposed and) examined. ) (86:9) They will be displayed and made known, as found in the Two Sahihs, where Ibn `Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõäúÕóÈõ áößõáøö ÛóÇÏöÑò áöæóÇÁñ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÚöäúÏó ÇÓúÊöåö ÈöŞóÏúÑö ÛóÏúÑóÊöåö¡ İóíõŞóÇáõ: åóĞöåö ÛóÏúÑóÉõ İõáóÇäö ÇÈúäö İõáóÇä»</div><br>  (On the Day of Resurrection a banner will be set up by his backside for every deceitful person, (whose size is) in accordance with the amount of his deceit. It be said, "This is the one who deceived so-and-so, the son of so-and-so.'') Thus, what they used to plot in secret will be made public. Allah will humiliate them before all of His creation, and the Lord will say to them, in rebuke and reprimand;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóíúäó ÔõÑóßóÂÆöìó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßõäÊõãú ÊõÔóÜŞøõæäó İöíåöãú</div><br>  (Where are My (so-called) partners, those over which you caused so much discord) meaning, you fought and made enemies for their sake, so where are they now to help and save you   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú íóäÕõÑõæäóßõãú Ãóæú íóäÊóÕöÑõæäó</div><br>  (Can they help you or (even) help themselves) 26:93   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ áóåõ ãöä ŞõæøóÉò æóáÇó äóÇÕöÑò </div><br>  (Then will (man) have no power, nor any helper.) 86:10 When evidence and proof is established against them, and the Word (of Allah) is justified against them, and they will be unable to give any excuse, realizing that escape is impossible, then   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõæÊõæÇú ÇáúÚöáúãó</div><br>  (Those who have been given the knowledge will say) who are the leaders in this world and the Hereafter and who know about the truth in this world and the Hereafter - will say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáúÎöÒúìó Çáúíóæúãó æóÇáúÓøõæÁó Úóáóì ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (Indeed it is a Day of disgrace and misery for the disbelievers.) meaning, today those who disbelieved in Allah and worshipped others who have no power either to benefit or to harm them are now surrounded by disgrace and punishment.  </div></body></html>
