Then, Allah brought life to him, by bringing life to his heart with faith, guiding him to it and guiding him to obeying His Messengers,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõ äõæÑğÇ íóãúÔöí Èöåö İöì ÇáäøóÇÓö ßóãóä</div><br>  (And set for him a light whereby he can walk amongst men.) for he became guided to where he should go and how to remain on the correct path. The light mentioned here is the Qur'an, according to Ibn `Abbas, as Al-`Awfi and Ibn Abi Talhah reported from him. As-Suddi said that the light mentioned here is Islam. Both meanings are correct.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóËóáõåõ İöí ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö áóíúÓó</div><br>  (Like him who is in the darkness) of ignorance, desires and various types of deviation,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÎóÇÑöÌò ãøöäúåóÇ ßóĞóáößó</div><br>  (From which he can never come out) for he is unable to find a way out from what he is in.

Whoever was struck by that light is guided, whoever it missed is astray.) Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ æóáöíøõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁÇãóäõæÇú íõÎúÑöÌõåõã ãøöäó ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö Åöáóì ÇáäøõæÑö æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÃóæúáöíóÂÄõåõãõ ÇáØøóÜÛõæÊõ íõÎúÑöÌõæäóåõã ãøöäó ÇáäøõæÑö Åöáóì ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáäøóÇÑö åõãú İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó </div><br>  (Allah is the Guardian of those who believe.

You are only a warner.) 35:19-23 There are many other Ayat on this subject. We explained before why Allah mentioned the light in the singular sense and the darkness in the plural sense when we explained the Ayah at the beginning of the Surah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáó ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö æóÇáäøõæÑó</div><br>  (And originated the darknesses and the light.) 6:1 Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Òõíøöäó áöáúßóÜİöÑöíäó ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (Thus it is made fair seeming to the disbelievers that which they used to do.) means, We made their ignorance and misguidance appear fair to them, as Allah decreed out of His wisdom, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him alone without partners.   </div></body></html>
