Then Allah says, warning and threatening them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÑúÊóŞöÈú íóæúãó ÊóÃúÊöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁõ ÈöÏõÎóÇäò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  (Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) It was narrated that Masruq said, "We entered the Masjid -- i.e., the Masjid of Kufah at the gates of Kindah -- and a man was reciting to his companions,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó ÊóÃúÊöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁõ ÈöÏõÎóÇäò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) He asked them; `Do you know what that is' That is the smoke that will come on the Day of Resurrection. It will take away the hearing and sight of the hypocrites, but for the believers it will be like having a cold.''' He said, "We came to Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, and told him about that. He was lying down, and he sat up with a start and said, `Allah said to your Prophet   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ãóÂ ÃóÓúÜóáõßõãú Úóáóíúåö ãöäú ÃóÌúÑò æóãóÂ ÃóäóÂ ãöäó ÇáúãõÊóßóáøöİöíäó </div><br>  (Say: "No wage do I ask of you for this, nor am I one of the pretenders.'') (38:86). And it is part of knowledge that when a man does not know something, he should say, `Allah knows best.' I will tell you a Hadith about that. When the Quraysh did not respond to Islam and they grew stubborn, the Messenger of Allah invoked Allah against them that they would have years like the years (of drought and famine) of Yusuf. They became so exhausted and hungry that they ate bones and dead meat. They looked at the sky, but they saw nothing but smoke.''' According to another report: "A man would look at the sky and he would see nothing between him and the sky except a smoky haze, because of his exhaustion.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÑúÊóŞöÈú íóæúãó ÊóÃúÊöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁõ ÈöÏõÎóÇäò ãøõÈöíäò - íóÛúÔóì ÇáäøóÇÓó åóÜĞóÇ ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ </div><br>  (Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people, this is a painful torment) A man came to the Messenger of Allah and said, "O Messenger of Allah! Pray to Allah to send rain to Mudar, for they are dying. So the Prophet prayed for rain for them, and they got rain. Then the Ayah was revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ßóÇÔöİõæÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö ŞóáöíáÇğ Åöäøóßõãú ÚóÂÆöÏõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.) Ibn Mas`ud said, "Do you think that the torment will be removed for them on the Day of Resurrection When they were granted ease, they reverted to their former state. Then Allah revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó äóÈúØöÔõ ÇáúÈóØúÔóÉó ÇáúßõÈúÑóì ÅöäøóÇ ãõäÊóŞöãõæäó </div><br>  (On the Day when We shall strike you with the Great Batshah. Verily, We will exact retribution.)'' He said, "This means the day of Badr.'' Ibn Mas`ud said, "Five things have come to pass: the smoke, the (defeat of the) Romans, the (splitting of the) moon, the Batshah, and the torment.''  This Hadith was narrated in the Two Sahihs. It was also recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, and by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in their (Books of) Tafsir, and by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim with a number of chains of narration. A number of the Salaf, such as Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak and `Atiyah Al-`Awfi concurred with Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation of this Ayah and his view that the smoke already happened. This was also the view of Ibn Jarir. According to the Hadith of Abu Sarihah, Hudhayfah bin Asid Al-Ghifari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "The Messenger of Allah looked out upon us from a room while we were discussing the Hour. He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóŞõæãõ ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉõ ÍóÊúì ÊóÑóæúÇ ÚóÔúÑó ÂíóÇÊò: ØõáõæÚó ÇáÔøóãúÓö ãöäú ãóÛúÑöÈöåóÇ¡ æóÇáÏøõÎóÇäó¡ æóÇáÏøóÇÈøóÉó¡ æóÎõÑõæÌó íóÃúÌõæÌó æóãóÃúÌõæÌó¡ æóÎõÑõæÌó ÚöíúÓóì ÇÈúäö ãóÑúíóãó æóÇáÏøóÌøóÇáó¡ æóËóáóÇËóÉó ÎõÓõæİò: ÎóÓúİñ ÈöÇáúãóÔúÑöŞö¡ æóÎóÓúİñ ÈöÇáúãóÛúÑöÈö¡ æóÎóÓúİñ ÈöÌóÒöíÑóÉö ÇáúÚóÑóÈö¡ æóäóÇÑğÇ ÊóÎúÑõÌõ ãöäú ŞóÚúÑö ÚóÏóäó ÊóÓõæŞõ ÇáäøóÇÓó Ãóæú ÊóÍúÔõÑõ ÇáäøóÇÓó ÊóÈöíÊõ ãóÚóåõãú ÍóíúËõ ÈóÇÊõæÇ¡ æóÊóŞöíáõ ãóÚóåõãú ÍóíúËõ ŞóÇáõæÇ»</div><br>  (The Hour will not come until you see ten signs. The rising of the sun from the west; the smoke; the beast; the emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj; the appearance of `Isa bin Maryam; the Dajjal; three cases of the earth collapsing -- one in the east, one in the west, and one in the Arabian Peninsula; and a fire which will emerge from the bottom of Aden and will drive the people -- or gather the people -- stopping with them when they stop to sleep at night or rest during the day.)'' This was recorded only by Muslim in his Sahih In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that the Messenger of Allah said to Ibn Sayyad:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí ÎóÈóÃúÊõ áóßó ÎóÈúÃ»</div><br>  (I am concealing something for you.) He said, It is Ad-Dukh. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÎúÓóÃú İóáóäú ÊóÚúÏõæó ŞóÏúÑóß»</div><br>  (Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) He said, "The Messenger of Allah was concealing from him the words,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÑúÊóŞöÈú íóæúãó ÊóÃúÊöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁõ ÈöÏõÎóÇäò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  (Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.)''This indicates that the smoke is yet to appear. Ibn Sayyad was a fortune-teller who heard things through the Jinn, whose speech is unclear, therefore he said, "It is Ad-Dukh,'' meaning Ad-Dukhan (the smoke). When the Messenger of Allah was sure what was happening, that the source of his information was the Shayatin, he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÎúÓóÃú İóáóäú ÊóÚúÏõæó ŞóÏúÑóß»</div><br>  (Be off with you! You cannot get further than your rank.) There are numerous Marfu` and Mawquf Hadiths, Sahih, Hasan and others, which indicate that the smoke is one of the awaited signs (of the Hour). This is also the apparent meaning of Ayat in the Qur'an. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÑúÊóŞöÈú íóæúãó ÊóÃúÊöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁõ ÈöÏõÎóÇäò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  (Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke.) meaning, clearly visible, such that all people will see it. According to Ibn Mas`ud's interpretation, this was a vision which they saw because of their intense hunger and exhaustion. He also interprets the Ayah   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÛúÔóì ÇáäøóÇÓó</div><br>  (Covering mankind,) meaning, it covered them and overwhelmed them. But if it was only an illusion which happened to the idolators of Makkah, Allah would not have said "covering mankind.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóÜĞóÇ ÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ</div><br>  (this is a painful torment.) means, this will be said to them by way of rebuke. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íõÏóÚøõæäó Åöáóì äóÇÑö Ìóåóäøóãó ÏóÚøğÇ - åóÜĞöåö ÇáäøóÇÑõ ÇáøóÊöì ßõäÊõã ÈöåóÇ ÊõßóĞøöÈõæäó </div><br>  (The Day when they will be pushed down by force to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing. This is the Fire which you used to deny.) (52:13-14). Or some of them will say that to others.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑøóÈøóäóÇ ÇßúÔöİú ÚóäøóÇ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈó ÅöäøóÇ ãúÄúãöäõæäó </div><br>  ((They will say): "Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we shall become believers!'') means, when the disbelievers witness the punishment of Allah, they will ask for it to be taken away from them. This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÊóÑóì ÅöĞú æõŞöİõæÇú Úóáóì ÇáäøóÇÑö İóŞóÇáõæÇú íáóíúÊóäóÇ äõÑóÏøõ æóáÇó äõßóĞøöÈó ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊö ÑóÈøöäóÇ æóäóßõæäó ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó </div><br>  (If you could but see when they will be held over the (Hell) Fire! They will say: "Would that we were but sent back (to the world)! Then we would not deny the Ayat of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!'') (6:27)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäĞöÑö ÇáäøóÇÓó íóæúãó íóÃúÊöíåöãõ ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈõ İóíóŞõæáõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÙóáóãõæÇú ÑóÈøóäóÂ ÃóÎøöÑúäóÂ Åöáóì ÃóÌóáò ŞóÑöíÈò äøõÌöÈú ÏóÚúæóÊóßó æóäóÊøóÈöÚö ÇáÑøõÓõáó Ãóæóáóãú ÊóßõæäõæÇú ÃóŞúÓóãúÊõãú ãøöä ŞóÈúáõ ãóÇ áóßõãú ãøöä ÒóæóÇáò </div><br>  (And warn mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them; then the wrongdoers will say: "Our Lord!

(14:44) Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøóì áóåõãõ ÇáĞøößúÑóì æóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóåõãú ÑóÓõæáñ ãøõÈöíäñ - Ëõãøó ÊóæóáøóæúÇú Úóäúåõ æóŞóÇáõæÇú ãõÚóáøóãñ ãøóÌúäõæäñ </div><br>  (How can there be for them an admonition, when a Messenger explaining things clearly has already come to them. Then they had turned away from him and said: "(He is) one taught, a madman!'') meaning, `what further admonition do they need when We have sent them a Messenger with a clear Message and warning Yet despite that, they turned away from him, opposed him and rejected him, and they said: (He is) one taught (by a human being), a madman.' This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãóÆöĞò íóÊóĞóßøóÑõ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ æóÃóäøóì áóåõ ÇáĞøößúÑóì</div><br>  (On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance (then) avail him) (89:23)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÊóÑóì ÅöĞú İóÒöÚõæÇú İóáÇó İóæúÊó æóÃõÎöĞõæÇú ãöä ãøóßóÇäò ŞóÑöíÈò - æóŞóÇáõæÇú ÁóÇãóäøóÇ Èöåö æóÃóäøóì áóåõãõ ÇáÊøóäóÇæõÔõ ãöä ãøóßóÇäö ÈóÚöíÏò </div><br>  (And if you could but see, when they will be terrified with no escape, and they will be seized from a near place.

(34:51-52)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ßóÇÔöİõæÇú ÇáúÚóĞóÇÈö ŞóáöíáÇğ Åöäøóßõãú ÚóÂÆöÏõæäó </div><br>  (Verily, We shall remove the torment for a while. Verily, you will revert.) means, `if We were to remove the torment from you for a while, and send you back to the world, you would go back to your former state of disbelief and denial.' This is like the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ÑóÍöãúäóÜåõãú æóßóÔóİúäóÇ ãóÇ Èöåöãú ãøöä ÖõÑøò áøóáóÌøõæÇú İöì ØõÛúíóÜäöåöãú íóÚúãóåõæäó </div><br>  (And though We had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them, still they would obstinately persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.)

And indeed they are liars) (6:28) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of the "Great Batshah''</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó äóÈúØöÔõ ÇáúÈóØúÔóÉó ÇáúßõÈúÑóì ÅöäøóÇ ãõäÊóŞöãõæäó </div><br>  (On the Day when We shall strike you with the great Batshah. Verily, We will exact retribution.) Ibn Mas`ud interpreted this to mean the day of Badr. This is also the view of a group who agreed with Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, about the meaning of the smoke, as discussed above. It was also narrated from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, in a report related to him from Al-`Awfi and from Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him. This is possible, but the apparent meaning is that it refers to the Day of Resurrection, although the day of Badr was also a day of vengeance.  Ibn Jarir said, "Ya`qub narrated to me; Ibn `Ulayyah narrated to me, Khalid Al-Hadhdha' narrated to us, from `Ikrimah who said, `Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Ibn Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said that "the great Batshah'' is the day of Badr, and I say that it is the Day of Resurrection.'' This chain of narration is Sahih to him. This is also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri and of `Ikrimah according to the more authentic of the two reports narrated from him. And Allah knows best.  </div></body></html>
