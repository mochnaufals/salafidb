After this, they gave him the glad tidings of the birth of a son and the destruction of the people of Lut. When they told him of this, he spoke to them as Sa`id bin Jubayr narrated concerning this verse. Sa`id said: When Jibril and the other angels who were with him came to Ibrahim, they said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ãõåúáößõæ Ãóåúáö åóÜĞöåö ÇáúŞóÑúíóÉö</div><br>  (Verily, we are going to destroy the people of this town.) Ibrahim said to them, "Will you destroy a town that has three hundred believers in it'' They said, "No.'' He then said, "Will you destroy a town that has two hundred believers in it'' They said, "No.'' He said, "Will you destroy a town that has forty believers in it'' They said, "No.'' He then said, "Thirty'' They still replied, "No.'' This continued until he said, "Five'' They said, "No.'' Then he said, "What do you think if there is one Muslim man in the town, would you destroy it'' They said, "No.'' With this, Ibrahim said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó İöíåóÇ áõæØÇğ ŞóÇáõæÇú äóÍúäõ ÃóÚúáóãõ Èöãóä İöíåóÇ áóäõäóÌøöíóäøóåõ æóÃóåúáóåõ ÅöáÇøó ÇãúÑóÃóÊóåõ</div><br>  (But there is Lut in it. They said: "We know better who is there. We will verily, save him and his family except his wife.'') Therefore, Ibrahim remained silent and his soul was at rest. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó áóÍóáöíãñ ÃóæøóÇåñ ãøõäöíÈñ </div><br>  (Verily, Ibrahim was, without doubt, forbearing, used to invoke Alllah with humility, and was repentant (to Allah).) 11:75 This is a commendation for Ibrahim because of these beautiful characteristics. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÅöÈúÑóåöíãõ ÃóÚúÑöÖú Úóäú åóÜĞóÂ Åöäøóåõ ŞóÏú ÌóÂÁó ÃóãúÑõ ÑóÈøößó</div><br>  (O Ibrahim! Forsake this. Indeed, the commandment of your Lord has gone forth.) This means the decree was settled concerning them and the Word was already given that they should be destroyed. The evil torment was coming to them, that cannot be averted from wicked people.  </div></body></html>
