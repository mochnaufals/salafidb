Mujahid said, "Maqalid means `keys' in Persian.'' This was also the view of Qatadah, Ibn Zayd and Sufyan bin `Uyaynah. As-Suddi said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóåõ ãóŞóÇáöíÏõ ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (To Him belong the Maqalid of the heavens and the earth.) "The treasures of the heavens and the earth.'' Both opinions mean that the control of all things is in the Hand of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, for His is the dominion and to Him is the praise, and He is able to do all things. He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÈöÜóÇíóÜÊö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And those who disbelieve in the Ayat of Allah,) meaning, His proof and evidence,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÎóÜÓöÑõæäó</div><br>  (such are they who will be the losers.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóİóÛóíúÑó Çááøóåö ÊóÃúãõÑõæäøöì ÃóÚúÈõÏõ ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúÌóÜåöáõæäó </div><br>  (Say: "Do you order me to worship other than Allah O you fools!'') The reason for the revelation of this Ayah was narrated by Ibn Abi Hatim and others from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that the idolators in their ignorance called the Messenger of Allah to worship their gods, then they would worship his God with him. Then these words were revealed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóİóÛóíúÑó Çááøóåö ÊóÃúãõÑõæäøöì ÃóÚúÈõÏõ ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúÌóÜåöáõæäó - æóáóŞóÏú ÃõæúÍöìó Åöáóíúßó æóÅöáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ãöä ŞóÈúáößó áóÆöäú ÃóÔúÑóßúÊó áóíóÍúÈóØóäøó Úóãóáõßó æóáóÊóßõæäóäøó ãöäó ÇáúÎóÜÓöÑöíäó </div><br>  (Say: "Do you order me to worship other than Allah O you fools!'' And indeed it has been revealed to you, as it was to those before you: "If you join others in worship with Allah, surely your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.'')
