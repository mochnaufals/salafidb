And Allah says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíúÓó Úóáóíúßó åõÏóÇåõãú æóáóÜßöäøó Çááøóåó íóåúÏöì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (Not upon you is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills) (2:272).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóãóÇ Úóáóíúßó ÇáúÈóáóÜÛõ æóÚóáóíúäóÇ ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈõ</div><br>  (your duty is only to convey (the Message) and on Us is the reckoning) (13:40). And Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäú Úóáóíúßó ÅöáÇøó ÇáúÈóáóÜÛõ</div><br>  (Your duty is to convey.) meaning, `all that We require you to do is to convey the Message of Allah to them.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóÂ ÅöĞóÂ ÃóĞóŞúäóÇ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ãöäøóÇ ÑóÍúãóÉğ İóÑöÍó ÈöåóÇ</div><br>  (And verily, when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us, he rejoices there at;) means, when a time of ease and comfort comes to him, he is happy about it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÊõÕöÈúåõãú</div><br>  (but when befalls them) means mankind.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóíøöÆóÉñ</div><br>  (some evil) means, drought, punishment, tribulation or difficulty,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøó ÇáÅöäÓóÜäó ßóİõæÑñ</div><br>  (then verily, man (becomes) ingrate!) means, he forgets the previous times of ease and blessings and acknowledges nothing but the present moment. If times of ease come to him, he becomes arrogant and transgresses, but if any difficulty befalls him, he loses hope and is filled with despair. This is like what the Messenger of Allah said to the women:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ãóÚúÔóÑó ÇáäøöÓóÇÁö¡ ÊóÕóÏøóŞúäó¡ İóÅöäøöí ÑóÃóíúÊõßõäøó ÃóßúËóÑó Ãóåúáö ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  )(O women, give in charity, for I have seen that you form the majority of the people of Hell.) A woman asked, "Why is that, O Messenger of Allah'' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áöÃóäøóßõäøó ÊõßúËöÑúäó ÇáÔøößóÇíóÉó æóÊóßúİõÑúäó ÇáúÚóÔöíÑó¡ áóæú ÃóÍúÓóäúÊó Åöáì ÅöÍúÏóÇåõäøó ÇáÏøóåúÑó Ëõãøó ÊóÑóßúÊó íóæúãğÇ¡ ŞóÇáóÊú: ãóÇ ÑóÃóíúÊõ ãöäúßó ÎóíúÑğÇ ŞóØ»</div><br>  (Because you complain too much, and you are ungrateful to (your) husbands. If one of you were to be treated kindly for an entire lifetime, then that kindness was lacking for one day, she would say, `I have never seen anything good from you!') This is the case with most women, except for those whom Allah guides and who are among the people who believe and do righteous deeds. As the Prophet said, the believer is the one who:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóÊúåõ ÓóÑøóÇÁõ ÔóßóÑó¡ İóßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóåõ¡ æóÅöäú ÃóÕóÇÈóÊúåõ ÖóÑøóÇÁõ ÕóÈóÑó¡ İóßóÇäó ÎóíúÑğÇ áóåõ¡ æóáóíúÓó Ğóáößó áöÃóÍóÏò ÅöáøóÇ áöáúãõÄúãöä»</div><br>  (... if something good happens to him, he is thankful, and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him. This does not happen to anyone except the believer.)  </div></body></html>
