They later disputed so Allah sent the Prophets as warners and bringers of glad tidings.'' He then said that this is how `Abdullah read the Ayah:  ßóÇäó ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÃõãøóÉğ æóÇÍöÏóÉğ İóÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇ  The people were one Ummah and they then disputed.  Al-Hakim recorded this in his Mustadrak and said, "Its chain of narrators is Sahih, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.'' Abu Ja`far Razi reported that Abu Al-`Aliyah said that Ubayy bin Ka`b read the Ayah as:  ßóÇäó ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÃõãøóÉğ æóÇÍöÏóÉğ İóÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇ İóÈóÚóËó Çááåõ ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó ãõÈóÔøöÑöíäó æõãõäúĞöÑöíäó  The people were one Ummah and they then disputed and Allah sent the Prophets as warners and bringers of glad tidings.  `Abdur-Razzaq said that Ma`mar said that Qatadah said that Allah's statement:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÇäó ÇáäøóÇÓõ ÃõãøóÉğ æóÍöÏóÉğ</div><br>  (Mankind was one community) means; "They all had the guidance.

This is the day (Friday) that they disputed about, Allah guided us to it. So, the people follow us, as tomorrow is for the Jews and the day after is for the Christians.)  Ibn Wahb related that `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that his father said about the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóåóÏóì Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú áöãóÇ ÇÎúÊóáóİõæÇú İöíåö ãöäó ÇáúÍóŞøö ÈöÅöĞúäöåö</div><br>  (Then Allah by His leave guided those who believed to the truth of that wherein they differed.)  They disputed about the day of Congregation (Friday). The Jews made it Saturday while the Christians chose Sunday. Allah guided the Ummah of Muhammad to Friday. They also disputed about the true Qiblah. The Christians faced the east while the Jews faced Bayt Al-Maqdis. Allah guided the Ummah of Muhammad to the true Qiblah (Ka`bah in Makkah). They also disputed about the prayer, as some of them bow down, but do not prostrate, while others prostrate, but do not bow down. Some of them pray while talking and some while walking. Allah guided the Ummah of Muhammad to the truth. They also disputed about the fast; some of them fast during a part of the day, while others fast from certain types of foods. Allah guided the Ummah of Muhammad to the truth. They also disputed about Ibrahim. The Jews said, `He was a Jew,' while the Christians considered him Christian. Allah has made him a Haniyfan Musliman. Allah has guided the Ummah of Muhammad to the truth.  They also disputed about `Isa. The Jews rejected him and accused his mother of a grave sin, while the Christians made him a god and the son of God. Allah made him by His Word and a spirit from (those He created) Him. Allah guided the Ummah of Muhammad to the truth.''  Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöÅöĞúäöåö</div><br>  (...by His leave) meaning, `By His knowledge of them and by what He has directed and guided them to,' according to Ibn Jarir.
