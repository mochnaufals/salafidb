Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on the earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers.) (65. And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and had Taqwa, We would indeed have expiated for them their sins and admitted them to Gardens of pleasure (in Paradise).) (66. And if only they had acted according to the Tawrah, the Injil, and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Qur'an), they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet. And among them is a Muqtasid Ummah, but for most of them; evil is their work.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Jews Say That Allah's Hand is Tied up!</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah states that the Jews, may Allah's continuous curses descend on them until the Day of Resurrection, describe Him as a miser. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. The Jews also claim that Allah is poor, while they are rich. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáóÊö ÇáúíóåõæÏõ íóÏõ Çááøóåö ãóÛúáõæáóÉñ</div><br>  (The Jews say, "Allah's Hand is tied up.") "They do not mean that Allah's Hand is literally tied up. Rather, they mean that He is a miser and does not spend from what He has. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him.'' Similar was reported from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak. Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÌúÚóáú íóÏóßó ãóÛúáõæáóÉğ Åöáóì ÚõäõŞößó æóáÇó ÊóÈúÓõØúåóÇ ßõáøó ÇáúÈóÓúØö İóÊóŞúÚõÏó ãóáõæãğÇ ãøóÍúÓõæÑÇğ </div><br>  (And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.) In this Ayah, Allah prohibits stinginess and extravagance, which includes unnecessary and improper expenditures. Allah describes stinginess by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÌúÚóáú íóÏóßó ãóÛúáõæáóÉğ Åöáóì ÚõäõŞößó</div><br>  (And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck. ) Therefore, this is the meaning that the Jews meant, may Allah's curses be on them. `Ikrimah said that this Ayah was revealed about Finhas, one of the Jews, may Allah curse him. We mentioned before that Finhas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó İóŞöíÑñ æóäóÍúäõ ÃóÛúäöíóÂÁõ</div><br>  ("Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!'') and that Abu Bakr smacked him. Allah has refuted what the Jews attribute to Him and cursed them in retaliation for their lies and fabrications about Him. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÛõáøóÊú ÃóíúÏöíåöãú æóáõÚöäõæÇú ÈöãóÇ ŞóÇáõæÇú</div><br>  (Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered.) What Allah said occurred, for the Jews are indeed miserly, envious, cowards and tremendously humiliated. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú áóåõãú äóÕöíÈñ ãøöäó Çáúãõáúßö İóÅöĞÇğ áÇøó íõÄúÊõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓó äóŞöíÑÇğ - Ãóãú íóÍúÓõÏõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓó Úóáóì ãóÂ ÁóÇÊóÜåõãõ Çááøóåõ ãöä İóÖúáöåö İóŞóÏú ÁóÇÊóíúäóÂ ÁóÇáó ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈó æóÇáúÍößúãóÉó æóÁóÇÊóíúäóÜåõãú ãøõáúßÇğ ÚóÙöíãÇğ </div><br>  (Or have they a share in the dominion Then in that case they would not give mankind even a Naqir. Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His bounty Then, We had already given the family of Ibrahim the Book and the Hikmah, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.) and, n   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÖõÑöÈóÊú Úóáóíúåöãõ ÇáĞøöáøóÉõ</div><br>  (Indignity is put over them.) <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Allah's Hands are Widely Outstretched</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú íóÏóÇåõ ãóÈúÓõæØóÊóÇäö íõäİöŞõ ßóíúİó íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His bounty) as He wills.) Allah's favors are ample, His bounty unlimited, as He owns the treasures of everything. Any good that reaches His servants is from Him alone, without partners. He has created everything that we need by night or by day, while traveling or at home and in all situations and conditions. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÂÊóÇßõã ãøöä ßõáøö ãóÇ ÓóÃóáúÊõãõæåõ æóÅöä ÊóÚõÏøõæÇú äöÚúãóÉó Çááøóåö áÇó ÊõÍúÕõæåóÇ Åöäøó ÇáÅäúÓóÇäó áóÙóáõæãñ ßóİøóÇÑñ </div><br>  (And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrongdoer, an extreme ingrate.) There are many other Ayat on this subject. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said that `Abdur-Razzaq narrated to him that Ma`mar said that Hammam bin Munabbih said, "This is what Abu Hurayrah narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó íóãöíäó Çááåö ãóáúÃóì¡ áóÇ íóÛöíÖõåóÇ äóİóŞóÉñ¡ ÓóÍøóÇÁõ Çááøóíúáó æóÇáäøóåóÇÑó¡ ÃóÑóÃóíúÊõãú ãóÇ ÃóäúİóŞó ãõäúĞõ ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãæóÇÊ æóÇáúÃóÑúÖó¡ İóÅöäøóåõ áóãú íóÛöÖú ãóÇ İöí íóãöíäöåö ŞÇá : æóÚóÑúÔõåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãóÇÁö¡ æóİöí íóÏöåö ÇáúÃóÎõÑì ÇáúŞóÈúÖõ íóÑúİóÚõ æóíóÎúİöÖ»</div><br>  (Allah's Right Hand is perfectly full, and no amount of spending can decrease what He has, even though He spends by night and by day. Do you see how much Allah has spent since He created the heavens and earth Yet surely it has not decreased what He has in His Right Hand. His Throne is over the water and in His Other Hand is the hold by which He raises and lowers.) He also said, Şõæáõ Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáì:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúİöŞú¡ ÃõäúİöŞú Úóáóíúß»</div><br>  (Allah said, `Spend and I will spend on you.')'' This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Revelation to the Muslims only Adds to the Transgression and Disbelief of the Jews</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóíóÒöíÏóäøó ßóËöíÑÇğ ãøöäúåõã ãøóÂ ÃõäÒöáó Åöáóíúßó ãöä ÑøóÈøößó ØõÛúíóÜäÇğ æóßõİúÑÇğ</div><br>  (Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief.) meaning, the bounty that comes to you, O Muhammad, is a calamity for your enemies, the Jews and their kind. The more the revelation increases the believers in faith, good works, and beneficial knowledge, the more the disbelievers increase in envy for you and your Ummah, the more they increase in Tughyan -- which is to exceed the ordained limits for things -- and in disbelief -- meaning denial of you. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó áöáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú åõÏğì æóÔöİóÂÁñ æóÇáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõæäó İöì ÁóÇĞóÇäöåöãú æóŞúÑñ æóåõæó Úóáóíúåöãú Úóãğì ÃõæúáóÜÆößó íõäóÇÏóæúäó ãöä ãøóßóÇäò ÈóÚöíÏò</div><br>  (Say: "It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.

Therefore, their hearts are never united. Rather, their various groups and sects will always have enmity and hatred for each other, because they do not agree on the truth, and because they opposed you and denied you. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøóãóÂ ÃóæúŞóÏõæÇú äóÇÑÇğ áøöáúÍóÑúÈö ÃóØúİóÃóåóÇ Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it;) means, every time they try to plot against you and kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it and makes their plots turn against them. Therefore, their evil plots will return to harm them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÚóæúäó İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö İóÓóÇÏÇğ æóÇááøóåõ áÇó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúãõİúÓöÏöíäó</div><br>  (and they (ever) strive to make mischief on earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers.) It is their habit to always strive to cause mischief on the earth, and Allah does not like those with such behavior. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Had the People of the Book Adhered to their Book, they Would Have Acquired the Good of this Life and the Hereafter</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú Ãóäøó Ãóåúáó ÇáúßöÊóÜÈö ÁóÇãóäõæÇú æóÇÊøóŞóæúÇú</div><br>  (And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and had Taqwa...)

Had they adhered to the Books that they have with them which they inherited from the Prophets, without altering or changing these Books, these would have directed them to follow the truth and implement the revelation that Allah sent Muhammad with. These Books testify to the Prophet's truth and command that he must be followed. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøßóáõæÇú ãöä İóæúŞöåöãú æóãöä ÊóÍúÊö ÃóÑúÌõáöåöã</div><br>  (they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet.) refers to the tremendous provision that would have descended to them from the sky and grown for them on the earth.
