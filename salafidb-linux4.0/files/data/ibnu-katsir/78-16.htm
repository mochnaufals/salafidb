There are those who believe in it and those who disbelieve in it. Then Allah threatens those who deny the Day of Judgement by saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó ÓóíóÚúáóãõæäó - Ëõãøó ßóáÇøó ÓóíóÚúáóãõæäó </div><br>  (Nay, they will come to know!

(91:4) Qatadah commented;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ Çáøóíúáó áöÈóÇÓÇğ </div><br>  (And We have made the night as a covering,) meaning, a tranquil residence. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ ÇáäøóåóÇÑó ãóÚóÇÔÇğ </div><br>  (And We have made the day for livelihood.) meaning, `We made it radiant, luminous, and shining so that the people would be able to move about in it.' By it they are able to come and go for their livelihood, earning, business dealings and other than that as well. In reference to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈóäóíúäóÇ İóæúŞóßõãú ÓóÈúÚÇğ ÔöÏóÇÏÇğ </div><br>  (And We have built above you seven strong,) meaning, the seven heavens in their vastness, loftiness, perfection, precision, and adornment with both stable and moving stars.

Allah then says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäÒóáúäóÇ ãöäó ÇáúãõÚúÕöÑóÇÊö ãóÂÁğ ËóÌøóÇÌÇğ </div><br>  (And We have sent down from the Mu`sirat water Thajjaj.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "From the Mu`sirat means from the clouds.'' This was also stated by `Ikrimah, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Ath-Thawri, and it is preferred by Ibn Jarir. Al-Farra' said, "They are the clouds that are filled with rain, but they do not bring rain. This is like the woman being called Mu`sir when (the time of) her menstrual cycle approaches, yet she does not menstruate.'' This is as Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì íõÑúÓöáõ ÇáÑøöíóÜÍó İóÊõËöíÑõ ÓóÍóÇÈÇğ İóíóÈúÓõØõåõ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö ßóíúİó íóÔóÂÁõ æóíóÌúÚóáõåõ ßöÓóİÇğ İóÊóÑóì ÇáúæóÏúŞó íóÎúÑõÌõ ãöäú ÎöáÇóáöåö</div><br>  (Allah is He Who sends the winds, so that they raise clouds, and spread them along the sky as He wills, and then break them into fragments, until you see rain drops come forth from their midst!)

At-Thawri said, "Continuous.'' Ibn Zayd said, "Abundant.'' In the Hadith of the woman with prolonged menstrual bleeding, when the Messenger of Allah said to her,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäúÚóÊõ áóßö ÇáúßõÑúÓõİ»</div><br>  (I suggest you to make an absorbent cloth for yourself.)'' Meaning, `dress the area with cotton.' The woman replied, "O Messenger of Allah! It (the bleeding) is too much for that. Verily, it flows in profusely (Thajja).'' This contains an evidence for using the word Thajj to mean abundant, continuous and flowing. And Allah knows best. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøöäõÎúÑöÌó Èöåö ÍóÈøÇğ æóäóÈóÇÊÇğ - æóÌóäøóÜÊò ÃóáúİóÇİÇğ </div><br>  (That We may produce therewith corn and vegetation, and gardens that are Alfaf.) meaning, `so that We may bring out great abundance, goodness, benefit, and blessing through this water.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÈøÇğ</div><br>  (grains) This refers to that which is preserved for (the usage) of humans and cattle.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóäóÈóÇÊÇğ</div><br>  (and vegetations) meaning, vegetables that are eaten fresh.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóäøóÜÊò</div><br>  (And gardens) meaning, gardens of various fruits, differing colors, and a wide variety of tastes and fragrances, even if it is ingathered at one location of the earth.

This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóİöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ŞöØóÚñ ãøõÊóÌóÜæöÑóÊñ æóÌóäøóÜÊñ ãøöäú ÃóÚúäóÜÈò æóÒóÑúÚñ æóäóÎöíáñ Õöäúæóäñ æóÛóíúÑõ Õöäúæóäò íõÓúŞóì ÈöãóÂÁò æóÍöÏò æóäõİóÖøöáõ ÈóÚúÖóåóÇ Úóáóì ÈóÚúÖò İöì ÇáÇøòßõáö Åöäøó İöì Ğáößó áÂíóÜÊò áøöŞóæúãò íóÚúŞöáõæäó </div><br>  (And in the earth are neighboring tracts, and gardens of vines, and green crops, and date palms, growing into two or three from a single stem root, or otherwise, watered with the same water; yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat.
