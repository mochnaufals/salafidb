This is the opposite of what he has prepared for His enemies of Fire and Hell. Thus, He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ÇáúİóæúÒõ ÇáúßóÈöíÑõ</div><br>  (That is the supreme success.) Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÈóØúÔó ÑóÈøößó áóÔóÏöíÏñ </div><br>  (Verily, the punishment of your Lord is severe and painful.) meaning, indeed His punishment and His vengeance upon His enemies, who have rejected His Messengers, and opposed His command, is severe, great and strong. For verily, He is the Owner of power, Most Strong. He is the One that whatever He wants, then it will be however He wants it to be, in the matter of a blinking of an eye, or even swifter. Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ åõæó íõÈúÏöìÁõ æóíõÚöíÏõ </div><br>  (Verily, He it is Who begins and repeats.) meaning, from His perfect strength and power is that He begins the creation, and He repeats it just as He began it, without opposition or resistance.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáúÛóİõæÑõ ÇáúæóÏõæÏõ </div><br>  (And He is Oft-Forgiving, Al-Wadud.) meaning, He forgives the sin of whoever repents to Him and humbles himself before Him, no matter what the sin may be. Ibn `Abbas and others have said about the name Al-Wadud, "It means Al-Habib (the Loving).''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğõæ ÇáúÚóÑúÔö</div><br>  (Owner of the Throne,) meaning, the Owner of the Mighty Throne that is above all of the creation. Then He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúãóÌöíÏö</div><br>  (Al-Majid (the Glorious).) This word has been recited in two different ways: either with a Dhammah over its last letter (Al-Majidu), which is an attribute of the Lord, or with a Kasrah under its last letter (Al-Majid), which is a description of the Throne. Nevertheless, both meanings are correct.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÚøóÇáñ áøöãóÇ íõÑöíÏõ </div><br>  (Doer of what He intends.) meaning, whatever He wants He does it, and there is no one who can counter His ruling. He is not asked about what He does due to His greatness, His power, His wisdom and His justice. This is as we have related previously from Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, that it was said to him during the illness of (his) death, "Has a doctor seen you'' He replied, "Yes.'' They said, "What did he say to you'' He replied, "He said, `I am the Doer of whatever I intend.''' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáõ ÃóÊóÇßó ÍóÏöíËõ ÇáúÌõäõæÏö - İöÑúÚóæúäó æóËóãõæÏó </div><br>  (Has the story reached you of the hosts. Of Fir`awn and Thamud) meaning, has the news reached you of what Allah caused to befall them of torment, and that He sent down upon them the punishment that no one was able to ward off from them This is the affirmation of His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÈóØúÔó ÑóÈøößó áóÔóÏöíÏñ </div><br>  (Verily, the punishment of your Lord is severe and painful.) meaning, when He seizes the wrongdoer, He seizes him with a severe and painful punishment. It is the seizing punishment of One Most Mighty, and Most Powerful. Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáö ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú İöì ÊóßúĞöíÈò </div><br>  (Nay! The disbelievers (persisted) in denying.) meaning, they are in doubt, suspicion, disbelief and rebellion.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ãöä æóÑóÂÆöåöãú ãøõÍöíØñ </div><br>  (And Allah encompasses them from behind!) meaning, He has power over them, and is able to compel them. They cannot escape Him or evade Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú åõæó ŞõÑúÁóÇäñ ãøóÌöíÏñ </div><br>  (Nay! This is a Glorious Qur'an.) meaning, magnificent and noble.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì áóæúÍò ãøóÍúİõæÙò </div><br>  (In Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz!) meaning, among the most high gathering, guarded from any increase, decrease, distortion, or change. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Buruj, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.   		 			 								  			 		 			 </div></body></html>
