Say: "Avert death from your own selves, if you speak the truth.'') <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reason and Wisdom Behind the Defeat at Uhud</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæó áóãøóÇ ÃóÕóÜÈóÊúßõãú ãøõÕöíÈóÉñ</div><br>  (When a single disaster smites you), in reference to when the Muslims suffered seventy fatalities during the battle of Uhud,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃóÕóÈúÊõãú ãøöËúáóíúåóÇ</div><br>  (although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great,) during Badr, when the Muslims killed seventy Mushriks and captured seventy others,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞõáúÊõãú Ãóäøóì åóÜĞóÇ</div><br>  (you say: "From where does this come to us'') why did this defeat happen to us   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó ãöäú ÚöäÏö ÃóäúİõÓößõãú</div><br>  (Say, "It is from yourselves.'') Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "When Uhud occurred, a year after Badr, Muslims were punished for taking ransom from the disbelievers at Badr in return for releasing the Mushriks whom they captured in that battle. Thus, they suffered the loss of seventy fatalities and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah gave flight and abandoned him. The Messenger suffered a broken tooth, the helmet was smashed on his head and blood flowed onto his face. Allah then revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæó áóãøóÇ ÃóÕóÜÈóÊúßõãú ãøõÕöíÈóÉñ ŞóÏú ÃóÕóÈúÊõãú ãøöËúáóíúåóÇ ŞõáúÊõãú Ãóäøóì åóÜĞóÇ Şõáú åõæó ãöäú ÚöäÏö ÃóäúİõÓößõãú</div><br>  (When a single disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: "From where does this come to us'' Say, "It is from yourselves''.), because you took the ransom.'' Furthermore, Muhammad bin Ishaq, Ibn Jurayj, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and As-Suddi said that the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú åõæó ãöäú ÚöäÏö ÃóäúİõÓößõãú</div><br>  (Say, "It is from yourselves.'') means, because you, the archers, disobeyed the Messenger's command to not abandon your positions.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ</div><br>  (And Allah has power over all things.) and He does what He wills and decides what He wills, and there is none who can resist His decision.

They said: "Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you.'') 3:167,  This refers to the Companions of `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul who went back (to Al-Madinah) with him before the battle. Some believers followed them and encouraged them to come back and fight, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæö ÇÏúİóÚõæÇú</div><br>  (or defend), so that the number of Muslims increases, as Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Salih, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi stated. Al-Hasan bin Salih said that this part of the Ayah means, help by supplicating for us, while others said it means, man the posts. However, they refused, saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú äóÚúáóãõ ŞöÊóÇáÇğ áÇøóÊøóÈóÚúäóÜßõãú</div><br>  ("Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you.'') meaning, according to Mujahid, if we knew that you would fight today, we would join you, but we think you will not fight. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõãú áöáúßõİúÑö íóæúãóÆöĞò ÃóŞúÑóÈõ ãöäúåõãú áöáÅöíãóÜäö</div><br>  (They were that day, nearer to disbelief than to faith,)  This Ayah indicates that a person passes through various stages, sometimes being closer to Kufr and sometimes closer to faith, as evident by,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõãú áöáúßõİúÑö íóæúãóÆöĞò ÃóŞúÑóÈõ ãöäúåõãú áöáÅöíãóÜäö</div><br>  (They were that day, nearer to disbelief than to faith,)  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóŞõæáõæäó ÈöÃóİúæóåöåöã ãøóÇ áóíúÓó İöì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú</div><br>  (saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts.) for they utter what they do not truly believe in, such as,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóæú äóÚúáóãõ ŞöÊóÇáÇğ áÇøóÊøóÈóÚúäóÜßõãú</div><br>  ("Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you.'')  They knew that there was an army of idolators that came from a far land raging against the Muslims, to avenge their noble men whom the Muslims killed in Badr. These idolators came in larger numbers than the Muslims, so it was clear that a battle will certainly occur. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÈöãóÇ íóßúÊõãõæäó</div><br>  (And Allah has full knowledge of what they conceal.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó ŞóÇáõæÇú áÅöÎúæóäöåöãú æóŞóÚóÏõæÇú áóæú ÃóØóÇÚõæäóÇ ãóÇ ŞõÊöáõæÇ</div><br>  ((They are) the ones who said about their killed brethren while they themselves sat (at home): "If only they had listened to us, they would not have been killed.'') had they listened to our advice and not gone out, they would not have met their demise. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú İóÇÏúÑóÁõæÇ Úóäú ÃóäİõÓößõãõ ÇáúãóæúÊó Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó</div><br>  (Say: "Avert death from your own selves, if you speak the truth.'') meaning, if staying at home saves one from being killed or from death, then you should not die. However death will come to you even if you were hiding in fortified castles. Therefore, fend death off of yourselves, if you are right.  Mujahid said that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, "This Ayah 3:168 was revealed about `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul (the chief hypocrite).''  </div></body></html>
