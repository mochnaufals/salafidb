Then he sought to make them shun this world which they preferred to the Hereafter, and which had prevented them from believing in the Messenger of Allah, Musa, peace be upon him. He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íŞóæúãö ÅöäøóãóÇ åóÜĞöåö ÇáúÍóíóæÉõ ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ãóÊóÜÚñ</div><br>  (O my people!
