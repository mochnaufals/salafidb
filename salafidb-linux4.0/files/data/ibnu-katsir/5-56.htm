O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islam), Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers, fighting in the way of Allah, and never fearing the blame of the blamers. That is the grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower.) (55. Verily, your Protector is Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, those who perform the Salah, and give Zakah, and they bow down.) (56. And whosoever takes Allah, His Messenger, and those who have believed, as protectors, then the party of Allah will be the victorious.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Threatening to Replace the Believers With Another People if They Revert from Islam</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah emphasizes His mighty ability and states that whoever reverts from supporting His religion and establishing His Law, then Allah will replace them with whomever is better, mightier and more righteous in Allah's religion and Law. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáúİõŞóÑóÂÁõ æóÅöä ÊóÊóæóáøóæúÇú íóÓúÊóÈúÏöáú ŞóæúãÇğ ÛóíúÑóßõãú Ëõãøó áÇó íóßõæäõæÇú</div><br>  (And if you turn away, He will exchange you for some other people and they will not be your likes.) and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóãú ÊóÑó Ãóäøó Çááøóåó ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÃóÑúÖó ÈöÇáúÍŞøö Åöä íóÔóÃú íõĞúåöÈúßõãú æóíóÃúÊö ÈöÎóáúŞò ÌóÏöíÏò - æóãóÇ Ğóáößó Úóáóì Çááøóåö ÈöÚóÒöíÒò </div><br>  (Do you not see that Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth If He will, He can remove you and bring (in your place) a new creation! And for Allah that is not hard or difficult.)14:19-20. Verily this is not difficult or hard on Allah. Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ãóä íóÑúÊóÏøó ãöäßõãú Úóä Ïöíäöåö</div><br>  (O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion...) and turns back from the truth to falsehood, from now until the commencement of the Last Hour. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóĞöáøóÉò Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÃóÚöÒøóÉò Úóáóì ÇáúßóÜİöÑöíäó</div><br>  (humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers.) These are the qualities of perfect believers, as they are humble with their believing brothers and allies, stern with their enemies and adversaries. In another Ayah, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøõÍóãøóÏñ ÑøóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö æóÇáøóĞöíäó ãóÚóåõ ÃóÔöÏøóÂÁõ Úóáóì ÇáúßõİøóÇÑö ÑõÍóãóÂÁõ Èóíúäóåõãú</div><br>  (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves.) The Prophet is described as the smiling fighter, smiling to his allies and fighting his enemies. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõÌóÜåöÏõæäó İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö æóáÇó íóÎóÜİõæäó áóæúãóÉó áÇÆöãò</div><br>  (Fighting in the way of Allah, and never fearing the blame of the blamers.) Nothing prevents them from obeying Allah, establishing His Law, fighting His enemies, enjoining righteousness and forbidding evil. Certainly, nothing prevents them from taking this path, neither someone who seeks to hinder them, nor one who blames or chastises them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said, "My Khalil (intimate friend, the Messenger) has commanded me to do seven deeds. He commanded me to love the poor and to be close to them. He commanded me to look at those who are less than me and not those who are above me. He commanded me to keep the relations of the womb, even if they cut it. He commanded me not to ask anyone for anything, to say the truth even if it was bitter, and to not fear the blame of anyone for the sake of Allah. He commanded me to often repeat, `La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (There is no strength or power except from Allah)', for these words are from a treasure under the Throne (of Allah).'' It is confirmed in the Sahih;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ íóäúÈóÛöí áöáúãõÄúãöäö Ãóäú íõĞöáøó äóİúÓóå»</div><br>  (The believer is not required to humiliate himself.) He was asked; "How does one humiliate himself, O Messenger of Allah'' So he replied;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÊóÍóãøóáõ ãöäó ÇáúÈóáóÇÁö ãóÇ áóÇ íõØöíŞ»</div><br>  (He takes on tests that he cannot bear.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó İóÖúáõ Çááøóåö íõÄúÊöíåö ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (That is the grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He wills.) meaning, those who have these qualities, acquired it by Allah's bounty and favor and because He granted them these qualities.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ æóÓöÚñ Úóáöíãñ</div><br>  (And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower,) His favor is ever extending, and He has perfect knowledge of those who deserve or do not deserve His favor and bounty. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ æóáöíøõßõãõ Çááøóåõ æóÑóÓõæáõåõ æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú</div><br>  (Verily, your Protector is Allah, His Messenger, and the believers...) means, the Jews are not your friends. Rather, your allegiance is to Allah, His Messenger and the faithful believers.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó íõŞöíãõæäó ÇáÕøóáæÉó æóíõÄúÊõæäó ÇáÒøóßóæÉó</div><br>  (those who perform the Salah, and give the Zakah...) referring to the believers who have these qualities and establish the prayer, which is one of the most important pillars of Islam, for it includes worshipping Allah alone without partners. They pay Zakah, which is the right of the creation and a type of help extended to the needy and the poor. As for Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú ÑóÇßöÚõæäó</div><br>  (and they bow down,) some people thought that they give the Zakah while bowing down. If this were the case, then paying the Zakah while bowing would be the best form of giving Zakah. No scholar from whom religious rulings are taken says this, as much as we know. Therefore,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõãú ÑóÇßöÚõæäó</div><br>  (and they bow down,) means, they attend the prayer in congregation in Allah's Masjids and spend by way of charity on the various needs of Muslims. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÊóæóáøó Çááøóåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú İóÅöäøó ÍöÒúÈó Çááøóåö åõãõ ÇáúÛóÜáöÈõæäó </div><br>  (And whosoever takes Allah, His Messenger, and those who have believed, as protectors, then the party of Allah will be the victorious.) similarly Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÊóÈó Çááøóåõ áÇøÛúáöÈóäøó ÃóäóÇú æóÑõÓõáöì Åöäøó Çááøóåó Şóæöìøñ ÚóÒöíÒñ - áÇøó ÊóÌöÏõ ŞóæúãÇğ íõÄúãöäõæäó ÈöÇááøóåö æóÇáúíóæúãö ÇáÇøñÎöÑö íõæóÂÏøõæäó ãóäú ÍóÂÏøó Çááøóåó æóÑóÓõæáóåõ æóáóæú ßóÇäõæÇú ÁóÇÈóÂÁóåõãú Ãóæú ÃóÈúäóÂÁóåõãú Ãóæú ÅöÎúæóäóåõãú Ãóæú ÚóÔöíÑóÊóåõãú ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ßóÊóÈó İöì ŞõáõæÈöåöãõ ÇáÅöíãóÜäó æóÃóíøóÏóåõãú ÈöÑõæÍò ãøöäúåõ æóíõÏúÎöáõåõãú ÌóäøóÜÊò ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÇ ÇáÇøñäúåóÜÑõ ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÇ ÑóÖöìó Çááøóåõ Úóäúåõãú æóÑóÖõæÇú Úóäúåõ ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÍöÒúÈõ Çááøóåö ÃóáÇó Åöäøó ÍöÒúÈó Çááøóåö åõãõ ÇáúãõİúáöÍõæäó </div><br>  (Allah has decreed: "Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious.'' Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty. You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people). For such He has written faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with a Ruh (proof) from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow to dwell therein (forever). Allah is pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the party of Allah. Verily, it is the party of Allah that will be the successful.) Therefore, those who accept the allegiance of Allah - His Messenger and the faithful believers - will gain success in this life and the Hereafter.
