Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be a great torment).</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Meaning of Khatama</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  As-Suddi said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÊóãó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (Khatama Allah) means, "Allah has sealed.'' Qatadah said that this Ayah means, "Shaytan controlled them when they obeyed him. Therefore, Allah sealed their hearts, hearing and sight, and they could neither see the guidance nor hear, comprehend or understand.'' Ibn Jurayj said that Mujahid said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÊóãó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú</div><br>  (Allah has set a seal on their hearts), "A stamp. It occurs when sin resides in the heart and surrounds it from all sides, and this submersion of the heart in sin constitutes a stamp, meaning a seal.'' Ibn Jurayj also said that the seal is placed on the heart and the hearing. In addition, Ibn Jurayj said, that `Abdullah bin Kathir narrated that Mujahid said, "The stain is not as bad as the stamp, the stamp is not as bad as the lock which is the worst type.'' Al-A`mash said, "Mujahid demonstrated with his hand while saying, `They used to say that the heart is just like this - meaning the open palm. When the servant commits a sin, a part of the heart will be rolled up - and he rolled up his index finger. When the servant commits another sin, a part of the heart will be rolled up' - and he rolled up another finger, until he rolled up all of his fingers. Then he said, `Then, the heart will be sealed.' Mujahid also said that this is the description of the Ran (refer to 83:14).''  Al-Qurtubi said, "The Ummah has agreed that Allah has described Himself with sealing and closing the hearts of the disbelievers, as a punishment for their disbelief. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáú ØóÈóÚó Çááøóåõ ÚóáóíúåóÇ ÈößõİúÑöåöãú</div><br>  (Nay, Allah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief) (4:155).''  He then mentioned the Hadith about changing the hearts, (in which the Prophet supplicated),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ãõŞóáöÈó ÇáúŞõáõæÈö ËóÈøöÊú ŞõáõæÈóäóÇ Úóáì Ïöíäöß»</div><br>  (O You Who changes the hearts, make our hearts firm on Your religion.)  He also mentioned the Hadith by Hudhayfah recorded in the Sahih, in which the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊõÚúÑóÖõ ÇáúİöÊóäõ Úóáóì ÇáúŞõáõæÈö ßóÇáúÍóÕöíÑö ÚõæÏğÇ ÚõæÏğÇ¡ İóÃóíøõ ŞóáúÈò ÃõÔúÑöÈóåóÇ äõßöÊó İöíå äõßúÊóÉñ ÓóæúÏóÇÁõ æóÃóíøõ ŞóáúÈò ÃóäúßóÑóåóÇ äõßöÊó İöíåö äõßúÊóÉñ ÈóíúÖóÇÁõ ÍóÊì ÊóÕöíÑó Úóáóì ŞóáúÈóíúäö: Úóáì ÃóÈúíóÖó ãöËúáö ÇáÕøóİóÇ¡ İóáóÇ ÊóÖõÑøõåõ İöÊúäóÉñ ãóÇ ÏóÇãóÊö ÇáÓøóãóæóÇÊõ æóÇáúÃóÑúÖõ æóÇáúÂÎóÑõ ÃóÓúæóÏõ ãõÑúÈóÇÏøğÇ ßóÇáúßõæÒö ãõÌóÎøöíğÇ áóÇ íóÚúÑöİõ ãóÚúÑõæİğÇ æóáóÇ íõäúßöÑõ ãõäúßóÑğÇ»</div><br>  (The Fitan (trials, tests) are offered to the hearts, just as the straws that are sewn into a woven mat, one after another. Any heart that accepts the Fitan, then a black dot will be engraved on it. Any heart that rejects the Fitan, then a white dot will be engraved on it. The hearts will therefore become two categories: white, just like the barren rock; no Fitnah shall ever harm this category as long as the heavens and earth still exist. Another category is black, just as the cup that is turned upside down, for this heart does not recognize righteousness or renounce evil. )  Ibn Jarir said, "The truth regarding this subject is what the authentic Hadith from the Messenger of Allah stated. Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáúãõÄãöäó ÅöĞóÇ ÃóĞúäóÈó ĞóäúÈğÇ ßóÇäóÊú äõßúÊóÉğ ÓóæúÏóÇÁó İöí ŞóáúÈöåö¡ İóÅöäú ÊóÇÈó æóäóÒóÚó æóÇÓúÊóÚúÊóÈó ÕóŞöáó ŞóáúÈõåõ æóÅöäú ÒóÇÏó ÒóÇÏóÊú ÍóÊøóì ÊóÚúáõæó ŞóáúÈóåõ¡ İóĞáößó ÇáÑøóÇäõ ÇáøóĞöí ŞóÇáó Çááåõ ÊóÚóÇáì:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó Èóáú ÑóÇäó Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú ãøóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóßúÓöÈõæäó </div><br>  (When the believer commits a sin, a black dot will be engraved on his heart. If he repents, refrains and regrets, his heart will be polished again. If he commits more errors, the dots will increase until they cover his heart. This is the Ran (stain) that Allah described,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóáÇøó Èóáú ÑóÇäó Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú ãøóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóßúÓöÈõæäó </div><br>  (Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (stain) which they used to earn)'' (83:14).  At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi said that it is Hasan Sahih. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meaning of Ghishawah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Reciting the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÊóãó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú æóÚóáóì ÓóãúÚöåöãú</div><br>  (Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing), then pausing, then continuing with,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóáóì ÃóÈúÕóÜÑöåöãú ÛöÔóÜæóÉñ</div><br>  (And on their eyes there is a Ghishawah (covering)) is accurate, for the stamp is placed on the heart and the hearing while the Ghishawah, the covering, is appropriately placed on the eyes. In his Tafsir, As-Suddi said that Ibn `Abbas and Ibn Mas`ud said about Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÊóãó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ŞõáõæÈöåöãú æóÚóáóì ÓóãúÚöåöãú</div><br>  (Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing), "So that they neither understand nor hear. Allah also said that He placed a covering on their sight, meaning eyes, and so, they do not see.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Hypocrites</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  We mentioned that four Ayat in the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah described the believers. The two last Ayat (2:6-7) describe the disbelievers. Afterwards, Allah begins to describe the hypocrites who show belief and hide disbelief. Since the matter of the hypocrites is vague and many people do not realize their true reality, Allah mentioned their description in detail. Each of the characteristics that Allah used to described them with is a type of hypocrisy itself. Allah revealed Surat Bara'ah (chapter 9) and Surat Al-Munafiqun (chapter 63) about the hypocrites. He also mentioned the hypocrites in Surat An-Nur (24) and other Surahs, so that their description would be known and their ways and errors could be avoided. Allah said,  </div></body></html>
