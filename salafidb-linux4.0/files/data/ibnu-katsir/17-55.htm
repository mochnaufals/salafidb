We preferred some of them to others; to some of them Allah spoke (directly); others He raised to degrees (of honor.)) 2:253 This does not contradict the report in the Two Sahihs which says that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊõİóÖøöáõæÇ Èóíúäó ÇáúÃóäúÈöíóÇÁ»</div><br>  (Don't give superiority to any Prophet among (Allah's) Prophets.) What is meant in this Hadith is giving a superiority based on whims and fanaticism or sectarian feelings, not on the basis of evidence. If there is solid evidence, we have to follow it. There is no dispute that the Messengers are better than the rest of the Prophets, and that the mighty Messengers of Great Resolve are the best of all. They are the five mentioned in two Ayat of the Qur'an, in Surat Al-Ahzab:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ÃóÎóĞúäóÇ ãöäó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíúäó ãöíËóÇŞóåõãú æóãöäúßó æóãöä äøõæÍò æóÅöÈúÑóåöíãó æóãõæÓóì æóÚöíÓóì ÇÈúäö ãóÑúíóãó</div><br>  (And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you and from Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa and `Isa son of Maryam.) 33:7 and in Surat Ash-Shura:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÔóÑóÚó áóßõã ãøöäó ÇáöÏöíäö ãóÇ æóÕøóì Èöåö äõæÍÇğ æóÇáøóĞöì ÃóæúÍóíúäóÂ Åöáóíúßó æóãóÇ æóÕøóíúäóÇ Èöåö ÅöÈúÑóÇåöíãó æóãõæÓóì æóÚöíÓóì Ãóäú ÃóŞöíãõæÇú ÇáÏøöíäó æóáÇó ÊóÊóİóÑøóŞõæÇú İöíåö</div><br>  (He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh, and that which We have revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibrahim, Musa and `Isa saying you should establish religion and make no divisions in it.) 42:13 There is no dispute that Muhammad is the best of them, then Ibrahim, then Musa, then `Isa (peace be upon them all), according to the best-known view. We have discussed the evidence for this in detail elsewhere, and Allah is the source of help. Allah's saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóíúäóÇ ÏóÇæõæÏó ÒóÈõæÑÇğ</div><br>  (and to Dawud We gave the Zabur.) is an indication of his virtue and honor. Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Îõİøöİó Úóáóì ÏóÇæõÏó ÇáúŞõÑúÂäõ¡ İóßóÇäó íóÃúãõÑõ ÈöÏóæóÇÈøöåö İóÊõÓúÑóÌõ¡ İóßóÇäó íóŞúÑóÄõåõ ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú íóİúÑõÛ»</div><br>  (The Qur'an (i.e. revea- led Scripture of Zabur) was made easy for Dawud, so he would call for his mounts to be saddled, and he would finish reciting it (i.e., the Zabur) be- fore the job was done.)  </div></body></html>
