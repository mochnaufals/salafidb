After Allah mentioned the way of those who were themselves led to stray from His path and who hindered others from it, He emphasized the honor of the guidance and religion of truth that He sent His Messenger with. Allah said next,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåóÜĞóÇ ÕöÑóØõ ÑóÈøößó ãõÓúÊóŞöíãÇğ</div><br>  (And this is the path of your Lord leading straight.) that is, Islam, that We have legislated for you, O Muhammad, by revealing this Qur'an to you, is Allah's straight path.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú İóÕøóáúäóÇ ÇáÂíóÜÊö</div><br>  (We have detailed Our Ayat...)

Allah described Paradise as `the abode of peace', because its residents are safe due to their access to the straight path, which conforms to the way of the Prophets. And just as their way was not wicked, they earned the abode of peace which is free from all wickedness.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó æóáöíøõåõã</div><br>  (And He will be their Wali) Protector, Supporter and Helper,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (because of what they used to do,) As reward for their good deeds, Allah has favored them and been generous with them, and awarded them Paradise.  </div></body></html>
