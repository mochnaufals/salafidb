The First View  There are two opinions about this, one of them saying that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ÊóŞõæáõ áöáúãõÄúãöäöíäó</div><br>  ((Remember) when you said to the believers) 3:124, is related to His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóŞóÏú äóÕóÑóßõãõ Çááøóåõ ÈöÈóÏúÑò</div><br>  (And Allah has already made you victorious at Badr) 3:123.  This was reported from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, `Amr Ash-Sha`bi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and several others, Ibn Jarir also agreed with this opinion. `Abbad bin Mansur said that Al-Hasan said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ÊóŞõæáõ áöáúãõÄúãöäöíäó Ãóáóäú íóßúİöíßõãú Ãóä íõãöÏøóßõãú ÑóÈøõßõãú ÈöËóáÇóËóÉö ÁóÇáÇóİò ãøöäó ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö</div><br>  ((Remember) when you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels'') 3:124, is about the battle of Badr; Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded this statement.  Ibn Abi Hatim then reported that `Amr Ash-Sha`bi said, "On the day of Badr, the Muslims received information that Kurz bin Jabir (a prominent tribe chief) was aiding the idolators, and this news was hard on them, so Allah revealed;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóáóäú íóßúİöíßõãú Ãóä íõãöÏøóßõãú ÑóÈøõßõãú ÈöËóáÇóËóÉö ÁóÇáÇóİò ãøöäó ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö ãõäÒóáöíäó</div><br>  ("Is it not enough for you that your Lord (Allah) should help you with three thousand angels sent down''), until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãõÓóæøöãöíäó</div><br>  (having marks (of distinction)) 3:124,125.  The news of the defeat of the idolators at Badr reached Kurz and he did not reinforce them, and thus, Allah did not reinforce the Muslims with the five (thousands of angels).''  As for Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, he said, "Allah supported the Muslims with one thousand (angels), then the number reached three thousand, then five thousand.'' If one asks, according to this opinion, how can we combine between this Ayah and Allah's statement about Badr,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöĞú ÊóÓúÊóÛöíËõæäó ÑóÈøóßõãú İóÇÓúÊóÌóÇÈó áóßõãú Ãóäøöí ãõãöÏøõßõãú ÈöÃóáúİò ãøöäó ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö ãõÑúÏöİöíäó </div><br>  ((Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): "I will help you with a thousand angels, each behind the other (following one another) in succession.'') 8:9, until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøó Çááøóåó ÚóÒöíÒñ Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily! Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise) We say that the one thousand mentioned here does not contradict the three thousand mentioned in the above Ayah 3:124. The word "in succession'' means they follow each other and thus indicates that thousands more will follow them. The two Ayat above 8:9 and 3:124 are similar in meaning and it appears that they both were about the battle of Badr, because the angels did fight in the battle of Badr, as the evidence indicates. Allah knows best. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáóì Åöä ÊóÕúÈöÑõæÇú æóÊóÊøóŞõæÇú</div><br>  (But if you hold on to patience and have Taqwa,) 3:125 means, if you observe patience while fighting the enemy, all the while fearing Me and obeying My command. Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` and As-Suddi said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÃúÊõæßõãú ãøöä İóæúÑöåöãú åóÜĞóÇ</div><br>  (and they will come rushing) means, they (angels) will rush to you instantaneously. Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah means, "All at once''. It is also said that it means, before their anger subsides (against the disbelievers). The Second View  The second opinion stipulates that the promise mentioned here concerning the angels participating in battle is related to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞú ÛóÏóæúÊó ãöäú Ãóåúáößó ÊõÈóæøöìÁõ ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ãóŞóÇÚöÏó áöáúŞöÊóÇáö</div><br>  (And (remember) when you left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle) of Uhud. However, we should add, the angels did not come to the aid of Muslims at Uhud, because Allah made it conditional,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Èóáóì Åöä ÊóÕúÈöÑõæÇú æóÊóÊøóŞõæÇú</div><br>  (But if you hold on to patience and have Taqwa) 3: 125.  The Muslims were not patient at Uhud. Rather, they ran away and, consequently, did not receive the support of even one angel.  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íõãúÏöÏúßõãú ÑóÈøõßõãú ÈöÎóãúÓóÉö ÁóÇáÇİò ãøöäó ÇáúãóáóÜÆößóÉö ãõÓóæøöãöíäó</div><br>  (your Lord will help you with five thousand angels having marks), of distinction.  Abu Ishaq As-Subay`i said; from Harithah bin Mudarrib said that `Ali bin Abi Talib said, "The angels were distinguished by wearing white wool at Badr.'' The angels also had special markings distinguishing their horses.  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÌóÚóáóåõ Çááøóåõ ÅöáÇøó ÈõÔúÑóì áóßõãú æóáöÊóØúãóÆöäøó ŞõáõæÈõßõãú Èöåö</div><br>  (Allah made it not but as a message of good news for you and as an assurance to your hearts) 3:126.  This Ayah means, "Allah sent down angels and told you about their descent to encourage you and to comfort and reassure your hearts. You should know that victory only comes from Allah and that if He willed, He would have defeated your enemy without you having to fight them.'' For instance, Allah said after commanding the believers to fight,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó æóáóæú íóÔóÂÁ Çááøóåõ áÇóäúÊóÕóÑó ãöäúåõãú æóáóÜßöä áøíóÈúáõæó ÈóÚúÖóßõãú ÈöÈóÚúÖò æóÇáøóĞöíäó ŞõÊöáõæÇú İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö İóáóä íõÖöáøó ÃóÚúãóÜáóåõãú ÓóíóåúÏöíåöãú æóíõÕúáöÍõ ÈóÇáóåõãú æóíõÏúÎöáõåõãõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉó ÚóÑøóİóåóÇ áóåõãú</div><br>  (But if it had been Allah's will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others. But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost. He will guide them and set right their state. And admit them to Paradise which He has made known to them) 47:4-6.  This is why Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÌóÚóáóåõ Çááøóåõ ÅöáÇøó ÈõÔúÑóì áóßõãú æóáöÊóØúãóÆöäøó ŞõáõæÈõßõãú Èöåö æóãóÇ ÇáäøóÕúÑõ ÅöáÇøó ãöäú ÚöäÏö Çááøóåö ÇáúÚóÒöíÒö ÇáúÍóßöíãö </div><br>  (Allah made it not but as a message of good news for you and as an assurance to your hearts. And there is no victory except from Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise) 3:126.  This Ayah means, "Allah is the Almighty Whose power can never be undermined, and He has the perfect wisdom in His decrees and in all His decisions.'' Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíóŞúØóÚó ØóÑóİÇğ ãøöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú</div><br>  (That He might cut off a part of those who disbelieve,) 3:127 meaning, out of His wisdom, He commands you to perform Jihad and to fight.  Allah then mentions the various consequences of performing Jihad against the disbelievers. For instance, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöíóŞúØóÚó ØóÑóİÇğ</div><br>  (That He might cut off a part...) meaning, to cause a part of a nation to perish,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú Ãóæú íóßúÈöÊóåõãú</div><br>  (of those who disbelieve, or expose them to infamy,) by disgracing them and forcing them to return with only their rage, having failed in their aim to harm you. This is why Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú íóßúÈöÊóåõãú İóíóäŞóáöÈõæÇú</div><br>  (or expose them to infamy, so that they retire) to go back to their land,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÂÆöÈöíäó</div><br>  (frustrated) without achieving their aims.  Allah then mentions a statement that testifies that the decision in this life and the Hereafter is for Him Alone without partners,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó áóßó ãöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö ÔóìúÁñ</div><br>  (Not for you is the decision) 3:128  meaning, "The matter is all in My Hand.'' Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóãóÇ Úóáóíúßó ÇáúÈóáóÜÛõ æóÚóáóíúäóÇ ÇáúÍöÓóÇÈõ</div><br>  (your duty is only to convey (the Message) and on Us is the reckoning.) 13:40, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóíúÓó Úóáóíúßó åõÏóÇåõãú æóáóÜßöäøó Çááøóåó íóåúÏöì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (Not upon you is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills.) 2:272, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóßó áÇó ÊóåúÏöì ãóäú ÃóÍúÈóÈúÊó æóáóÜßöäøó Çááøóåó íóåúÏöì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (Verily, you guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills) 28: 56.  Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó áóßó ãöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö ÔóìúÁñ</div><br>  (Not for you is the decision;), means, "No part of the decision regarding My servants is yours, except what I command you.'' Allah then mentions the rest of the consequences of Jihad,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú íóÊõæÈó Úóáóíúåöãú</div><br>  (whether He pardons them) concerning the acts of disbelief that they commit, thus delivering them from misguidance to the guidance.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóæú íõÚóĞøöÈóåõãú</div><br>  (or punishes them;) in this life and the Hereafter because of their disbelief and errors,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóåõãú ÙóÜáöãõæäó</div><br>  (verily, they are the wrongdoers), and thus, they deserve such a fate.  Al-Bukhari recorded that, Salim bin `Abdullah said that his father said that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying -- when he raised his head from bowing in the second unit of the Fajr prayer -- "O Allah! Curse so-and-so,'' after saying; Sami` Allahu Liman Hamidah, Rabbana wa lakal-Hamd. Thereafter, Allah revealed this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó áóßó ãöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö ÔóìúÁñ</div><br>  (Not for you is the decision;) This was also recorded by An-Nasa'i. Imam Ahmad recorded that Salim bin `Abdullah said that his father said that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó ÇáúÚóäú İõáóÇäğÇ¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÇáúÚóäö ÇáúÍóÇÑöËó Èúäó åöÔóÇãò¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÇáúÚóäú Óõåóíúáó Èúäó ÚóãúÑòæ¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÇáúÚóäú ÕóİúæóÇäó Èúäó ÃõãóíøóÉ»</div><br>  (O Allah! Curse so-and-so. O Allah! Curse Al-Harith bin Hisham. O Allah! Curse Suhayl bin `Amr. O Allah! Curse Safwan bin Umayyah.)  Thereafter, this Ayah was revealed;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó áóßó ãöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö ÔóìúÁñ Ãóæú íóÊõæÈó Úóáóíúåöãú Ãóæú íõÚóĞøöÈóåõãú İóÅöäøóåõãú ÙóÜáöãõæäó </div><br>  (Not for you is the decision; whether He turns in mercy to (pardon) them or punishes them; verily, they are the wrongdoers) 3:128.  All these persons were pardoned (after they embraced Islam later on).  Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that when Allah's Messenger would supplicate against or for someone, he would do so when he was finished bowing and saying; Sami` Allahu Liman Hamidah, Rabbana wa lakal-Hamd. He would then say, (the Qunut)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Çááøóåõãøó ÃóäúÌö ÇáúæóáöíÏó Èúäó ÇáúæóáöíÏö¡ æóÓóáóãóÉó Èúäó åöÔóÇãò æóÚóíøóÇÔó Èúäó ÃóÈöí ÑóÈöíÚóÉó¡ æóÇáúãõÓúÊóÖúÚóİöíäó ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó¡ Çááøóåõãøó ÇÔúÏõÏú æóØúÃóÊóßó Úóáì ãõÖóÑó¡ æóÇÌúÚóáúåóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú Óöäöíäó ßóÓöäöí íõæÓõİ»</div><br>  (O Allah! Save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid, Salamah bin Hisham, `Ayyash bin Abi Rabi`ah and the weak and the helpless people among the faithful believers. O Allah! Be hard on the tribe of Mudar and let them suffer from years of famine like that of the time of Yusuf. )  He would say this supplication aloud. He sometimes would supplicate during the Dawn prayer, "O Allah! Curse so-and-so (persons),'' mentioning some Arab tribes. Thereafter, Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó áóßó ãöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö ÔóìúÁñ</div><br>  (Not for you is the decision.)  Al-Bukhari recorded that Hamid and Thabit said that, Anas bin Malik said that the Prophet was injured during the battle of Uhud and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóíúİó íõİúáöÍõ Şóæúãñ ÔóÌøõæÇ äóÈöíøóåõãú¿»</div><br>  (How can a people achieve success after having injured their Prophet)  Thereafter,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó áóßó ãöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö ÔóìúÁñ</div><br>  (Not for you is the decision,) was revealed.  Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that, the Prophet's front tooth was broken during the battle of Uhud and he also sustained injuries on his forehead until blood dripped on his face. The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóíúİó íõİúáöÍõ Şóæúãñ İóÚóáõæÇ åĞóÇ ÈöäóÈöíøöåöãú¡ æóåõæó íóÏúÚõæåõãú Åöáì ÑóÈøöåöãú ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó¿»</div><br>  (How can a people achieve success after having done this to their Prophet who is calling them to their Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored) Allah revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóíúÓó áóßó ãöäó ÇáÇøñãúÑö ÔóìúÁñ Ãóæú íóÊõæÈó Úóáóíúåöãú Ãóæú íõÚóĞøöÈóåõãú İóÅöäøóåõãú ÙóÜáöãõæäó </div><br>  (Not for you is the decision; whether He turns in mercy to (pardons) them or punishes them; verily, they are the wrongdoers.) Muslim also collected this Hadith.  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóááøóåö ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóãóÇ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the Earth.) 3:129, everything is indeed the property of Allah and all are servants in His Hand.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÛúİöÑõ áöãóä íóÔóÂÁõ æóíõÚóĞøöÈõ ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ</div><br>  (He forgives whom He wills, and punishes whom He wills.) for His is the decision and none can resist His decision.
