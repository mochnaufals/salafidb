They do not exalt themselves above the creatures of Allah, arrogantly oppressing them and spreading corruption among them. `Ikrimah said that this phrase referred to haughtiness and arrogance. Ibn Jurayj said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó íõÑöíÏõæäó ÚõáõæøÇğ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö</div><br>  (those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land) "Arrogance and tyranny,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó İóÓóÇÏÇğ</div><br>  (nor cause corruption) committing sins.'' Ibn Jarir recorded that `Ali said, "If a man wants the straps of his sandals to be better than the straps of his companion's sandals, then he is one of those referred to in the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÇáÏøóÇÑõ ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉõ äóÌúÚóáõåóÇ áöáøóĞöíäó áÇó íõÑöíÏõæäó ÚõáõæøÇğ İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóáÇó İóÓóÇÏÇğ æóÇáúÚóÜŞöÈóÉõ áöáúãõÊøóŞöíäó </div><br>  (That is the home of the Hereafter, We shall assign to those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land nor cause corruption. And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.) This is understood to mean that if his intention is to show off and appear better than others, then that is to be condemned, as it was reported in the Sahih that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóåõ ÃõæÍöíó Åöáóíøó Ãóäú ÊóæóÇÖóÚõæÇ ÍóÊøóì áóÇ íóİúÎóÑó ÃóÍóÏñ Úóáóì ÃóÍóÏò æóáóÇ íóÈúÛöí ÃóÍóÏñ Úóáóì ÃóÍóÏ»</div><br>  (It has been revealed to me that you should be humble to the extent that none of you boasts to others or mistreats others. ) But if a person simply likes to look good, then there is nothing wrong with that. It was recorded that a man said: "O Messenger of Allah, I like to have my garment looking good and my shoes looking good -- is this a kind of arrogance'' The Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ¡ Åöäøó Çááåó Ìóãöíáñ íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúÌóãóÇá»</div><br>  (No, for Allah is beautiful and loves beauty...) And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóä ÌóÂÁó ÈöÇáúÍóÓóäóÉö</div><br>  (Whosoever brings good,) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóåõ ÎóíúÑñ ãøöäúåóÇ</div><br>  (he shall have the better thereof;) meaning, the reward of Allah is better than the good deeds of His servant -- how can it not be, when Allah has multiplied it many times over This is the position of generosity. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä ÌóÂÁó ÈöÇáÓøóíøöÆóÉö İóáÇó íõÌúÒóì ÇáøóĞöíäó ÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÓøóíøöÆóÇÊö ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóÚúãóáõæäó</div><br>  (and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do.) This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä ÌóÂÁó ÈöÇáÓøóíøöÆóÉö İóßõÈøóÊú æõÌõæåõåõãú İöì ÇáäøóÇÑö åóáú ÊõÌúÒóæúäó ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (And whoever brings an evil deed, they will be cast down on their faces in the Fire. (And it will be said to them) "Are you being recompensed anything except what you used to do'') (27: 90). This is the postition of generosity and justice.  </div></body></html>
