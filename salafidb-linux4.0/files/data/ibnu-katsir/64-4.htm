We mentioned before that all creatures praise the glory of Allah, their Creator and Owner. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóåõ Çáúãõáúßõ æóáóåõ ÇáúÍóãúÏõ</div><br>  (His is the dominion, and to Him belongs the praise,) meaning, He is the One Who has control over all creation, the One praised for all He created and decreed. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ŞóÏöíÑñ</div><br>  (and He is Able to do all things.) means that whatever He wills occurs without resistance, and whatever He does not will, never occurs. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞóßõãú İóãöäßõãú ßóÇİöÑñ æóãöäßõãú ãøõÄúãöäñ</div><br>  (He it is Who created you, then some of you are disbelievers and some of you are believers.) meaning, Allah created you with these characteristics and He willed that for you. Therefore, there will be believers and disbelievers. Surely, Allah is the One Who sees those who deserve guidance and those who deserve misguidance. He is the Witness over His servant's deeds and He will completely recompense them. This is why Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÈöãóÇ ÊóÚúãóáõæäó ÈóÕöíÑñ</div><br>  (And Allah is All-Seer of what you do. ) Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóáóŞó ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÃóÑúÖó ÈöÇáúÍŞøö</div><br>  (He has created the heavens and the earth with truth,) with equity and wisdom,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÕóæøóÑóßõãú İóÃóÍúÓóäó ÕõæóÑóßõãú</div><br>  (and He shaped you and made good your shapes.) He made you in the best shapes and forms. Allah the Exalted said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáÅöäÓóÜäõ ãóÇ ÛóÑøóßó ÈöÑóÈøößó ÇáúßóÑöíãö - ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞóßó İóÓóæøóÇßó İóÚóÏóáóßó - İöì Ãóìøö ÕõæÑóÉò ãøóÇ ÔóÂÁó ÑóßøóÈóßó </div><br>  (O man! What has made you careless about your Lord, the most Generous Who created you, fashioned you perfectly and gave you due proportion; in whatever form He willed, He put you together.) (82:6-8) And His saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöì ÌóÚóÜáó áóßõÜãõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖó ŞóÜÑóÇÑÇğ æóÇáÓøóãóÂÁó ÈöäóÜÂÁğ æóÕóæøóÑóßõÜãú İóÃóÍúÓóäó ÕõæóÑóßõÜãú æóÑóÒóŞóßõÜãú ãøöäó ÇáØøóíøöÈóÜÊö</div><br>  (Allah, it is He Who has made for you the earth as a dwelling place and the sky as a canopy, and has given you shape and made your shapes good (looking) and has provided you with good things.) (40:64) and His saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöáóíúåö ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ</div><br>  (And to Him is the return.) means the return and final destination. Allah then informs of His knowledge of all that there is in the heavens, in the earth and in the souls, He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö æóíóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ ÊõÓöÑøõæäó æóãóÇ ÊõÚúáöäõæäó æóÇááøóåõ Úóáöíãõ ÈöĞóÇÊö ÇáÕøõÏõæÑö </div><br>  (He knows what is in the heavens and on earth, and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. And Allah is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts.)  </div></body></html>
