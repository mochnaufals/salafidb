He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íõßúÔóİõ Úóä ÓóÇŞò æóíõÏúÚóæúäó Åöáóì ÇáÓøõÌõæÏö İóáÇó íóÓúÊóØöíÚõæäó </div><br>  (The Day when the Shin shall be laid bare and they shall be called to prostrate themselves, but they shall not be able to do so.) meaning, the Day of Judgement and the horrors, earthquakes, trials, tests and great matters that will occur during it. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said that he heard the Prophet saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóßúÔöİõ ÑóÈøõäóÇ Úóäú ÓóÇŞöåö¡ İóíóÓúÌõÏõ áóåõ ßõáøõ ãõÄúãöäò æóãõÄúãöäóÉò¡ æóíóÈúŞóì ãóäú ßóÇäó íóÓúÌõÏõ İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ÑöíóÇÁğ æóÓõãúÚóÉğ¡ İóíóĞúåóÈõ áöíóÓúÌõÏó¡ İóíóÚõæÏõ ÙóåúÑõåõ ØóÈóŞğÇ æóÇÍöÏğÇ»</div><br>  (Our Lord will reveal His Shin, and every believing male and female will prostrate to Him. The only people who will remain standing are those who prostrated in the worldly life only to be seen and heard (showing off). This type of person will try to prostrate at that time, but his back will made to be one stiff plate (the bone will not bend or flex).)'' This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs and other books from different routes of transmission with various wordings. It is a long Hadith that is very popular. Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÜÔöÚóÉğ ÃóÈúÕóÜÑõåõãú ÊóÑúåóŞõåõãú ĞöáøóÉñ</div><br>  (Their eyes will be cast down and ignominy will cover them;) means, in the final abode, due to their crimes and arrogance in the worldly life. Thus they will be punished with the opposite of what they did. When they were called to prostrate in the worldly life, they refused to do so even though they were healthy and secure. Therefore, they will be punished with the lack of ability to do so in the Hereafter. When the Almighty Lord makes Himself visible (before the believers), then the believers will fall down in prostration to Him, but no one of the disbelievers and hypocrites will be able to prostrate. rather, their backs will become one plate. Everytime one of them attempts to prostrate, he will bow his neck but will not be able to prostrate. This is just like in the life of this world, when these people were in opposition to what the believers were doing. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>For Whoever denies the Qur'an</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóĞóÑúäöì æóãóä íõßóĞøöÈõ ÈöåóÜĞóÇ ÇáúÍóÏöíËö</div><br>  (Then leave Me alone with such as belie this narration.) meaning, the Qur'an. This is a sever threat which means, `leave Me alone with this person; I know about him and how I will gradually punish him and increase him in his falsehood. I am giving him respite for a while, then I will seize him with a mighty and powerful punishment.' Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóäóÓúÊóÏúÑöÌõåõã ãøöäú ÍóíúËõ áÇó íóÚúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (We shall punish them gradually from directions they perceive not.) meaning, and they will not even be aware of it. Rather, they will believe that it is a noble blessing from Allah, but really the same matter is actually a form of humiliation (for them). This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíóÍúÓóÈõæäó ÃóäøóãóÇ äõãöÏøõåõãú Èöåö ãöä ãøóÇáò æóÈóäöíäó - äõÓóÇÑöÚõ áóåõãú İöì ÇáúÎóíúÑóÊö Èóá áÇøó íóÔúÚõÑõæäó </div><br>  (Do they think that in wealth and children with which We expand them, We hasten unto them with good things. Nay, but they perceive not.) (23:55,56) Allah also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ äóÓõæÇú ãóÇ ĞõßøöÑõæÇú Èöåö İóÊóÍúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ÃóÈúæóÇÈó ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÇ İóÑöÍõæÇú ÈöãóÂ ÃõæÊõæÇú ÃóÎóĞúäóÜåõãú ÈóÛúÊóÉğ İóÅöĞóÇ åõãú ãøõÈúáöÓõæäó </div><br>  (So, when they forgot that which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of everything, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We punished them, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) Therefore, Allah says here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃõãúáöì áóåõãú Åöäøó ßóíúÏöì ãóÊöíäñ </div><br>  (And I will grant them a respite. Verily, My plan is strong.) meaning, `I will delay them, give them respite and extend their time. Yet, this is My plan, and My plot against them.' Thus, Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ßóíúÏöì ãóÊöíäñ</div><br>  (Verily, My plan is strong.) meaning, `great against whoever opposes My command, rejects My Messengers and dares to disobey Me.' In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from the Messenger of Allah that he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáì áóíõãúáöí áöáÙøóÇáöãö ÍóÊúì ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÎóĞóåõ áóãú íõİúáöÊúå»</div><br>  (Verily Allah the Exalted gives respite to the wrongdoer until He seizes him and he will not be able to escape Him.) Then he recited,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóĞáößó ÃóÎúĞõ ÑóÈøößó ÅöĞóÇ ÃóÎóĞó ÇáúŞõÑóì æóåöìó ÙóÜáöãóÉñ Åöäøó ÃóÎúĞóåõ Ãóáöíãñ ÔóÏöíÏñ </div><br>  (Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful (and) severe.) (11:102) In reference to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóãú ÊóÓúÜóáõåõãú ÃóÌúÑÇğ İóåõã ãøöä ãøóÛúÑóãò ãøõËúŞóáõæäó - Ãóãú ÚöäÏóåõãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈõ İóåõãú íóßúÊõÈõæäó </div><br>  (Or is it that you ask them for a wage, so that they are heavily burdened with debt Or that the Unseen is in their hands, so that they can write it down) the explanation of these two Ayat prece- ded in Surat At-Tur. The meaning of it is, `you, O Muhammad, call them to Allah without taking any wages from them. rather, you hope for the reward with Allah. Yet, they reject that which you have brought to them simply due to ignorance, disbelief and obstinacy.'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÕúÈöÑú áöÍõßúãö ÑóÈøößó æóáÇó Êóßõä ßóÕóÜÍöÈö ÇáúÍõæÊö ÅöĞú äóÇÏóì æóåõæó ãóßúÙõæãñ </div><br>  </div></body></html>
