Despite this explanation, man is very quarrelsome and opposes truth with falsehood,' except for those whom Allah guides to the path of salvation. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Messenger of Allah came to visit him and Fatimah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger at night, and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóáóÇ ÊõÕóáøöíóÇäö¿»</div><br>  (Are you not going to pray) I said, "O Messenger of Allah, our souls are in the Hand of Allah. If He wills to wake us, He will wake us.'' When I said that, he went away without returning. Then I heard him as he was walking away, slapping his thigh and saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóÇäó ÇáÅöäúÓóÜäõ ÃóßúËóÑó ÔóìÁò ÌóÏóáÇğ</div><br>  (But, man is ever more quarrelsome than anything.)'' It was also recorded in the Two Sahihs.  </div></body></html>
