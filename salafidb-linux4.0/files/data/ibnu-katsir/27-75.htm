Allah tells us about how the idolators asked about the Day of Resurrection, but thought it unlikely that it would ever come to pass.</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæäó ãóÊóì åóÜĞóÇ ÇáúæóÚúÏõ Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÜÏöŞöíäó </div><br>  (And they say: "When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if you are truthful'')  Allah said, responding to them:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú</div><br>  (Say) `O Muhammad,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÓóì Ãóä íóßõæäó ÑóÏöİó áóßõã ÈóÚúÖõ ÇáøóĞöì ÊóÓúÊóÚúÌöáõæäó</div><br>  (Perhaps that which you wish to hasten on, may be close behind you.) Ibn `Abbas said, "That which you wish to hasten on has come close to you, or some of it has come close.'' This was also the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata Al-Khurasani, Qatadah and As-Suddi. This is also what is meant in the Ayat:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóŞõæáõæäó ãóÊóì åõæó Şõáú ÚóÓóì Ãóä íóßõæäó ŞóÑöíÈğÇ</div><br>  (And they say: "When will that be'' Say: "Perhaps it is near!'')

This was reported from Mujahid. Then Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ÑóÈøóßó áóĞõæ İóÖúáò Úóáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö</div><br>  (Verily, your Lord is full of grace for mankind,) meaning, He abundantly bestows His blessings on them even though they wrong themselves, yet despite that they do not give thanks for those blessings, except for a few of them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøó ÑóÈøóßó áóíóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ Êõßöäøõ ÕõÏõæÑõåõãú æóãóÇ íõÚúáöäõæäó </div><br>  (And verily, your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they reveal.) means, He knows what is hidden in their hearts just as He knows what is easily visible.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÓóæóÂÁñ ãøöäúßõãú ãøóäú ÃóÓóÑøó ÇáúŞóæúáó æóãóäú ÌóåóÑó Èöåö</div><br>  (It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly) (13:10),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÚúáóãõ ÇáÓøöÑøó æóÃóÎúİóì</div><br>  (He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden) (20: 7),   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóáÇ Íöíäó íóÓúÊóÛúÔõæäó ËöíóÇÈóåõãú íóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ íõÓöÑøõæäó æóãóÇ íõÚúáöäõæäó</div><br>  (Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal) (11:5). Then Allah tells us that He is the Knower of the unseen in the heavens and on earth, and that He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, i.e., that which is unseen by His servants and that which they can see. And Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ãöäú ÛóÂÆöÈóÉò</div><br>  (and there is nothing hidden) Ibn `Abbas said, "This means, there is nothing   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì ÇáÓøóãóÂÁö æóÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöáÇøó İöì ßöÊóÜÈò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (in the heaven and the earth but it is in a Clear Book.)

Verily, that is easy for Allah.) (22:70)  </div></body></html>
