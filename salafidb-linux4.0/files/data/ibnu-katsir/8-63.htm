If they continue being hostile and opposing you, then fight them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä ÌóäóÍõæÇú</div><br>  (But if they incline), and seek,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöáÓøóáúãö</div><br>  (to peace), if they resort to reconciliation, and seek a treaty of non-hostility,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÌúäóÍú áóåóÇ</div><br>  (you also incline to it), and accept offers of peace from them. This is why when the pagans inclined to peace in the year of Hudaybiyah and sought cessation of hostilities for nine years, between them and the Messenger of Allah he accepted this from them, as well as, accepting other terms of peace they brought forth. `Abdullah bin Al-Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøóåõ Óóíóßõæäõ ÈóÚúÏöí ÇÎúÊöáóÇİñ Ãóæú ÃóãúÑñ İóÅöäö ÇÓúÊóØóÚúÊó Ãóäú íóßõæäó ÇáÓøöáúãó İóÇİúÚóá»</div><br>  (There will be disputes after me, so if you have a way to end them in peace, then do so.)  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊóæóßøóáú Úóáóì Çááøóåö</div><br>  (and trust in Allah. ) Allah says, conduct a peace treaty with those who incline to peace, and trust in Allah. Verily, Allah will suffice for you and aid you even if they resort to peace as a trick, so that they gather and reorganize their forces,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøó ÍóÓúÈóßó Çááøóåõ</div><br>  (then verily, Allah is All-Sufficient for you). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Reminding the Believers of Allah's Favor of uniting Them</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah mentioned His favor on the Prophet , in that He aided him with believers, the Muhajirin and the Ansar,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÃóíøóÏóßó ÈöäóÕúÑöåö æóÈöÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäóæóÃóáøóİó Èóíúäó ŞõáõæÈöåöãú</div><br>  (He it is Who has supported you with His help and with the believers.

Before Islam, there were many wars between the Ansar tribes of Aws and Khazraj, and there were many causes to stir unrest between them.

Thus Allah makes His Ayat clear to you, that you may be guided.) 3:103  In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that when the Messenger of Allah gave a speech to the Ansar about the division of war booty collected in the battle of Hunayn, he said to them,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÇ ãóÚúÔóÑó ÇáúÃóäúÕóÇÑö Ãóáóãú ÃóÌöÏúßõãú ÖõáøóÇáğÇ İóåóÏóÇßõãõ Çááåõ Èöí¡ æóÚóÇáóÉğ İóÃóÛúäóÇßõãõ Çááåõ Èöí¡ æóßõäúÊõãú ãõÊóİóÑøöŞöíäó İóÃóáøóİóßõãõ Çááåõ Èöí»</div><br>  (O Ansar!
