This plant grows from the water that comes down from the sky. These plants are food for people, such as fruits and other different types and kinds of foods. Some other kinds are food for cattle such as clover plants (i.e. green fodder for the cattle) and herbage etc.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì ÅöĞóÂ ÃóÎóĞóÊö ÇáÇøñÑúÖõ ÒõÎúÑõİóåóÇ</div><br>  (until when the earth is clad in its adornments ,)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÒøóíøóäóÊú</div><br>  (and is beautified ) meaning, it became good by what grows on its hills such as blooming flowers of different shapes and colors.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÙóäøó ÃóåúáõåóÂ</div><br>  (and its people think...) those who planted it and put it in the ground,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóäøóåõãú ŞóÇÏöÑõæäó ÚóáóíúåóÂ</div><br>  (that they have all the powers of disposal over it) to cultivate it and harvest it. But while they were in that frame of mind, a thunderbolt or a severe, cold storm came to it. It dried its leaves and spoiled its fruits. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóÊóÇåóÂ ÃóãúÑõäóÇ áóíúáÇğ Ãóæú äóåóÇÑğÇ İóÌóÚóáúäóÇåóÇ ÍóÕöíÏğÇ</div><br>  (Our command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, ) it became dry after it was green and flourishing.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóÃóä áøóãú ÊóÛúäó ÈöÇáÇøñãúÓö</div><br>  (as if it had not flourished yesterday!) as if nothing existed there before. Qatadah said: "As if it had not flourished; as if it was never blessed.'' Such are things after they perish, they are as if they had never existed. Similarly, the Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íõÄúÊóì ÈöÃóäúÚóãö Ãóåúáö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ İóíõÛúãóÓõ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑö ÛóãúÓóÉğ¡ İóíõŞóÇáõ áóåõ: åóáú ÑóÃóíúÊó ÎóíúÑğÇ ŞóØøõ¿ åóáú ãóÑøó Èößó äóÚöíãñ ŞóØøõ¿ İóíóŞõæáõ: áóÇ¡ æóíõÄúÊóì ÈöÃóÔóÏøö ÇáäøóÇÓö ÚóĞóÇÈğÇ İöí ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ¡ İóíõÛúãóÓõ İöí ÇáäøóÚöíãö ÛóãúÓóÉğ¡ Ëõãøó íõŞóÇáõ áóåõ: åóáú ÑóÃóíúÊó ÈõÄúÓğÇ ŞóØøõ¿ İóíóŞõæáõ áóÇ»</div><br>  (A person who led the most prosperous life in this world will be brought up and dipped once in the Fire. He will then be asked: `Have you ever found any good or comfort' He will reply: `No.' And a person who had experienced extreme adversity in this world will be brought up and dipped once in the bliss (of Paradise). Then he will be asked: 'Did you ever face any hardship or misery' He will reply: `No.') Allah said about those who were destroyed:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóÕúÈóÍõæÇú İöì ÏöíóÇÑöåöãú ÌóÜËöãöíäóßóÃóä áøóãú íóÛúäóæúÇú İöíåóÂ</div><br>  (So they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes; as if they had never lived there.)11:67-68  Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßóĞáößó äõİóÕøöáõ ÇáÂíóÜÊö</div><br>  (Thus do We explain the Ayat. ..) We do explain the proofs, and evidences, in detail   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöŞóæúãò íóÊóİóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (for the people who reflect.) so they may take a lesson from this example in the swift vanishing of this world from its people while they are deceived by it. They would trust this world and its promises, and then it unexpectedly turns away from them. This world, in its nature, runs away from those who seek it but seeks those who run away from it. Allah mentioned the parable of this world and the plants of the earth in several Ayat in His Noble Book. He said in Surat Al-Kahf:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÖúÑöÈú áóåõã ãøóËóáó ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ßóãóÂÁò ÃóäúÒóáúäóÜåõ ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö İóÇÎúÊóáóØó Èöåö äóÈóÇÊõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖö İóÃóÕúÈóÍó åóÔöíãğÇ ÊóĞúÑõæåõ ÇáÑøöíÇÍõ æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÔóìúÁò ãøõŞúÊóÏöÑğÇ </div><br>  (And put forward to them the example of the life of this world: it is like the water (rain) which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green. But (later) it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds scatter. And Allah is able to do everything.) (18:45) He also gave similar examples in both Surat Az-Zumar 39:21 and Surat Al-Hadid 57:20. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Invitation to the Everlasting Gifts that do not vanish</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóÏúÚõæ Åöáóì ÏóÇÑö ÇáÓøóáÇóãö</div><br>  (And Allah calls to the Abode of Peace) When Allah mentioned the swiftness of this world and its termination, He invited people to Paradise and encouraged them to seek it. He called it the Abode of Peace. It is the Abode of Peace because it is free from defects and miseries. So Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ íóÏúÚõæ Åöáóì ÏóÇÑö ÇáÓøóáÇóãö æóíóåúÏöì ãóä íóÔóÂÁõ Åöáóì ÕöÑóÇØò ãøõÓúÊóŞöíãò </div><br>  (Allah calls to the Home of Peace and guides whom He wills to the straight path.) It was narrated that Jabir bin `Abdullah said: "Allah's Messenger came out one day and said to us:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí ÑóÃóíúÊõ İöí ÇáúãóäóÇãö ßóÃóäøó ÌöÈúÑöíáó ÚöäúÏó ÑóÃúÓöí¡ æóãöíßóÇÆöíáó ÚöäúÏó ÑöÌúáóíøó¡ íóŞõæáõ ÃóÍóÏõåõãóÇ áöÕóÇÍöÈöåö: ÇÖúÑöÈú áóåõ ãóËóáğÇ¡ İóŞóÇáó: ÇÓúãóÚú¡ ÓóãöÚóÊú ÃõĞõäõßó¡ æóÇÚúŞöáú¡ ÚóŞóáó ŞóáúÈõßó¡ ÅöäøóãóÇ ãóËóáõßó æóãóËóáõ ÃõãøóÊößó ßóãóËóáö ãóáößò ÇÊøóÎóĞó ÏóÇÑğÇ¡ Ëõãøó Èóäóì İöíåóÇ ÈóíúÊğÇ¡ Ëõãøó ÌóÚóáó İöíåóÇ ãóÃúÏóÈÉğ¡ Ëõãøó ÈóÚóËó ÑóÓõæáğÇ íóÏúÚõæ ÇáäøóÇÓó Åöáóì ØóÚóÇãöåö¡ İóãöäúåõãú ãóäú ÃóÌóÇÈó ÇáÑøóÓõæáó¡ æóãöäúåõãú ãóäú ÊóÑóßóåõ¡ İóÇááåõ Çáúãóáößõ¡ æóÇáÏøóÇÑõ ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãõ¡ æóÇáúÈóíúÊõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉõ¡ æóÃóäúÊó íóÇ ãõÍóãøóÏõ ÑóÓõæáñ¡ İóãóäú ÃóÌóÇÈóßó ÏóÎóáó ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãó¡ æóãóäú ÏóÎóáó ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãó ÏóÎóáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó¡ æóãóäú ÏóÎóáó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó Ãóßóáó ãöäúåóÇ»</div><br>  (I have seen in my sleep that it was as if Jibril was at my head and Mika'il at my leg. They were saying to each other: `Give an example for him.' He said: `Listen, your ear may listen. And fathom, your heart may fathom. The parable of you and your Ummah is that of a king who has built a house on his land. He arranged a banquet in it. Then he sent a messenger to invite the people to his food. Some accepted the invitation and others did not. Allah is the King and the land is Islam, the house is Paradise and you Muhammad are the Messenger. Whosoever responds to your call enters Islam. And whosoever enters Islam enters Paradise. And whosoever enters Paradise eats from it.) Ibn Jarir recorded this Hadith. It was also reported that Abu Ad-Darda' said that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäú íóæúãò ØóáóÚóÊú İöíåö ÇáÔøóãúÓõ ÅöáøóÇ æóÈöÌóäúÈóíúåóÇ ãóáóßóÇäö íõäóÇÏöíóÇäö íóÓúãóÚõåõ ÎóáúŞõ Çááåö ßõáøõåõãú ÅöáøóÇ ÇáËøóŞóáóíúäö: íóÇ ÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ åóáõãøõæÇ Åöáóì ÑóÈøößõãú¡ Åöäøó ãóÇ Şóáøó æóßóİóì ÎóíúÑñ ãöãøóÇ ßóËõÑó æóÃóáúåóì»</div><br>  (Two angels descend every day in which the sun rises and say that which all Allah's creatures would hear except Jinn and humans: `O people!
