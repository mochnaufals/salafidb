There they will be thrown into their constricted spaces, tied up to their shoulders, unable to move or call for help, and unable to escape their plight --- is this better, or the eternal Paradise which Allah has promised to the pious among His servants, which He has prepared for them as a reward and ultimate destiny in return for their obedience to Him in this world'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóåõãú İöíåóÇ ãóÇ íóÔóÂÁõæäó</div><br>  (For them there will be therein all that they desire,) of delights such as food, drink, clothing, dwellings, means of transportation and scenery, and other things that no eye has seen, no ear has heard, nor the heart of anyone can comprehend. They will abide therein forever; it will never cease or come to an end, and they will never leave it. This is what Allah has promised to those whom He has blessed and to whom He has shown His favor.

In this Surah Allah mentions Hell, then refers to the situation of the people of Paradise. This is similar to the passage in Surat As-Saffat where Allah mentions the status of the people of Paradise, with its beauty and joy, then He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóĞóáößó ÎóíúÑñ äøõÒõáÇğ Ãóãú ÔóÌóÑóÉõ ÇáÒøóŞøõæãö - ÅöäøóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÜåóÇ İöÊúäóÉğ áøöáÙøóÜáöãöíäó - ÅöäøóåóÇ ÔóÌóÑóÉñ ÊóÎúÑõÌõ İöì ÃóÕúáö ÇáúÌóÍöíãö - ØóáúÚõåóÇ ßóÃóäøóåõ ÑõÁõæÓõ ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäö - İóÅöäøóåõãú áÇøßöáõæäó ãöäúåóÇ İóãóÇáöÆõæäó ãöäúåóÇ ÇáúÈõØõæäó - Ëõãøó Åöäøó áóåõãú ÚóáóíúåóÇ áóÔóæúÈÇğ ãöäú Íóãöíãò - Ëõãøó Åöäøó ãóÑúÌöÚóåõãú áÅöáóì ÇáúÌóÍöíãö - Åöäøóåõãú ÃóáúİóæúÇú ÁóÇÈóÂÁóåõãú ÖóÂáøöíäó - İóåõãú Úóáóì ÁóÇËóÇÑöåöãú íõåúÑóÚõæäó </div><br>  :(Is that better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum Truly, We have made it a trial for the wrongdoers.

Then on the top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.
