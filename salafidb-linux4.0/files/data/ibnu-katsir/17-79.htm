Hushaym narrated from Mughirah from Ash-Sha`bi from Ibn `Abbas: "Midday means when the sun is at its zenith.'' This was also reported by Nafi` from Ibn `Umar, and by Malik in his Tafsir from Az-Zuhri from Ibn `Umar. This was the opinion of Abu Barzah Al-Aslami and Mujahid, and of Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Ja`far Al-Baqir and Qatadah. It is also understood to generally refer to the times of the five prayers. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöÏõáõæßö ÇáÔøóãúÓö Åöáóì ÛóÓóŞö Çáøóíúáö</div><br>  (from midday till the darkness of the night,) meaning darkness, or it was said, sunset.

The details of the timings of the prayers were reported in the Mutawatir Sunnah from the words and deeds of the Prophet , and this is what the people of Islam have followed until the present day, passing it down from generation to generation, century after century, as we have stated in the appropriate place, praise be to Allah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Meeting of the Angels at the Times of Fajr and `Asr Prayers</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ŞõÑúÁóÇäó ÇáúİóÌúÑö ßóÇäó ãóÔúåõæÏğÇ</div><br>  (Verily the recitation of the Qur'an in the early down is ever witnessed.)  Ibn Mas`ud reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet said concerning this Ayah :   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞõÑúÁóÇäó ÇáúİóÌúÑö Åöäøó ŞõÑúÁóÇäó ÇáúİóÌúÑö ßóÇäó ãóÔúåõæÏğÇ</div><br>  (and recite the Qur'an in the early dawn.

This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi said, "It is Hasan Sahih.'' According to the version recorded in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÊóÚóÇŞóÈõæäó İöíßõãú ãóáóÇÆößóÉñ ÈöÇááøóíúáö æóãóáóÇÆößóÉñ ÈöÇáäøóåóÇÑö¡ æóíóÌúÊóãöÚõæäó İöí ÕóáóÇÉö ÇáÕøõÈúÍö æóİöí ÕóáóÇÉö ÇáúÚóÕúÑö¡ İóíóÚúÑõÌõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÈóÇÊõæÇ İöíßõãú İóíóÓúÃóáõåõãú ÑóÈøõåõãú æóåõæó ÃóÚúáóãõ Èößõãú ßóíúİó ÊóÑóßúÊõãú ÚöÈóÇÏöí¿ İóíóŞõæáõæäó: ÃóÊóíúäóÇåõãú æóåõãú íõÕóáøõæäó¡ æóÊóÑóßúäóÇåõãú æóåõãú íõÕóáøõæä»</div><br>  (The angels of the night and the angels of the day come amongst you in successive groups (in shifts). They meet at the Morning prayer (Fajr) and at the Mid-afternoon prayer ('Asr). Those who stayed among you at ascend, and their Lord asks them, although He knows best about you, "How did you leave My servants'' They say, "We came to them when they were praying and we left them when they were praying.'') `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, "The two guards meet at Salat Al-Fajr, and one group ascends while the other stays where it is. '' These were the comments of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Mujahid, Qatadah and others on the Tafsir of this Ayah. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to pray Tahajjud</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó Çáøóíúáö İóÊóåóÌøóÏú Èöåö äóÇİöáóÉğ áøóßó</div><br>  (And in some parts of the night (also) offer the Salah with it as an additional prayer for you.) Here Allah commands him (the Prophet ) to offer further prayers at night after the prescribed prayers. It was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Hurayrah that when the Messenger of Allah was asked which prayer is best after the prescribed prayers, he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÕóáóÇÉõ Çááøóíúá»</div><br>  (The Night prayer) Allah commanded His Messenger to pray the Night prayer after offering the prescribed prayers, and the term Tahajjud refers to prayer that is offered after sleeping. This was the view of `Alqamah, Al-Aswad, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and others. It is also well-known from the Arabic language itself. A number of Hadiths report that the Messenger of Allah used to pray Tahajjud after he had slept. These include reports from Ibn `Abbas, `A'ishah and other Companions, may Allah be pleased with them. This has been discussed in detail in the appropriate place, praise be to Allah.  Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "This is what comes after `Isha', or it could mean what comes after sleeping.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>äóÇİöáóÉğ áøóßó</div><br>  (an additional prayer (Nawafil)) means the Night prayer has been made an extra prayer specifically for the Prophet , because all his previous and future sins had been forgiven. But for other members of his Ummah, offering optional prayers may expiate for whatever sins they may commit. This was the view of Mujahid, and it was reported in Al-Musnad from Abu Umamah Al-Bahili.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÓóì Ãóä íóÈúÚóËóßó ÑóÈøõßó ãóŞóÇãÇğ ãøóÍúãõæÏğÇ</div><br>  (It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud.) meaning, `do that which you are commanded to do, and We will raise you to a station of praise and glory (Maqam Mahmud) on the Day of Resurrection, where all of creation will praise you,' as will their Creator, may He be glorified and exalted. Ibn Jarir said, "Most of the commentators said, `This is the position to which Muhammad will be raised on the Day of Resurrection, to intercede for the people so that their Lord will relieve them of some of the hardships they are facing on that Day.''' It was reported that Hudhayfah said, "Mankind will be gathered in one arena, where they will all hear the call and will all be seen. They will be standing barefoot and naked as they were created, and no person shall speak except by the leave of Allah. He will call out, `O Muhammad,' and he will respond,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÈøóíúßó æóÓóÚúÏóíúßó¡ æóÇáúÎóíúÑõ İöí íóÏóíúßó æóÇáÔøóÑøõ áóíúÓó Åöáóíúßó¡ æóÇáúãóåÏöíøõ ãóäú åóÏóíúÊó¡ æóÚóÈúÏõßó Èóíúäó íóÏóíúßó¡ æóãöäúßó æóÅöáóíúßó áóÇ ãóäúÌóì æóáóÇ ãóáúÌóÃó ãöäúßó ÅöáøóÇ Åöáóíúßó¡ ÊóÈóÇÑóßúÊó æóÊóÚóÇáóíúÊó ÓõÈúÍóÇäóßó ÑóÈøó ÇáúÈóíúÊ»</div><br>  (At your service, all goodness is in Your Hands and evil is not to be attributed to You. The one who is guided is the one whom You guide. Your servant is before You, from You, and to You and there is no salvation or refuge from You except with You. May You be blessed and exalted, Glory be to You, Lord of the House (the Ka`bah).) This is the position of praise and honor (Maqam Mahmud) which was mentioned by Allah.'' Ibn `Abbas said, "The position of praise and honor is the position of intercession.'' Ibn Abi Najih reported something similar from Mujahid, and this was also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri. Qatadah said, "He is the first one for whom the earth will be opened on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be the first one to intercede.'' So the scholars consider this the position of praise and glory to which Allah referred in the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÓóì Ãóä íóÈúÚóËóßó ÑóÈøõßó ãóŞóÇãÇğ ãøóÍúãõæÏğÇ</div><br>  (It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud.) I, Ibn Kathir, say: the Messenger of Allah will have honors in the Day of Resurrection in which no one else will have a share, honors which will not be matched by anyone else. He is the first one for whom the earth will be opened and he will come forth riding to the gathering place. He will have a banner under which Adam and anyone else will gather, and he will have the Hawd (Lake) to which no one else will have more access than he. He will have the right of the Grand Intercession with Allah when He comes to judge between His creation. This will be after the people ask Adam, then Nuh, then Ibrahim, then Musa, then `Isa to intercede, and each of them will say, "I am not able for that.'' Then they will come to Muhammad , and he will say,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóäóÇ áóåóÇ ÃóäóÇ áóåóÇ»</div><br>  (I can do that, I can do that.) We will mention this in more detail shortly, If Allah wills. Part of that will be that he will intercede for some people who had been commanded to be taken to Hell, and they will be brought back. He is the first Prophet whose Ummah will be judged, and the first to take them across the Bridge over the Fire, and the first to intercede in Paradise, as was reported in Sahih Muslim. In the Hadith about the Trumpet, it says that none of the believers will enter Paradise except through his intercession. He will be the first to enter Paradise, and his Ummah will be the first nation to enter. He will intercede for the status to be raised for people whose deeds could not get them there. He is the one who will reach Al-Wasilah, which is the highest position in Paradise, which befits no one but him. When Allah gives permission for intercession on behalf of sinners, the angels, Prophets and believers will intercede, and he will intercede for people whose number is known only to Allah. No one will intercede like him and no one will match him in intercession. This has been explained in comprehensive detail at the end of the Book of Sirah, in the chapter on the specific qualities. Praise be to Allah. Now with the help of Allah we will mention the Hadiths that were reported concerning Al-Maqam Al-Mahmud. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Umar said: "On the Day of Resurrection, the people will be humbled to their knees, each nation following its Prophet and saying, `O so-and-so, intercede,' `O so-and-so, intercede,' until the power of intercession is given to Muhammad , and that will be the day when Allah raises him to a position of praise and glory. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÇáÔøóãúÓó áóÊóÏúäõæ ÍóÊøóì íóÈúáõÛó ÇáúÚóÑóŞõ äöÕúİó ÇáúÃõĞõäö¡ İóÈóíúäóãóÇ åõãú ßóĞóáößó ÇÓúÊóÛóÇËõæÇ ÈöÂÏóãó İóíóŞõæáõ: áóÓúÊõ ÈöÕóÇÍöÈö Ğóáößó¡ Ëõãøó ÈöãõæÓóì İóíóŞõæáõ ßóĞóáößó¡ Ëõãøó ÈöãõÍóãøóÏòİóíóÔúİóÚõ Èóíúäó ÇáúÎóáúŞö İóíóãúÔöí ÍóÊøóì íóÃúÎõĞó ÈöÍóáóŞóÉö ÈóÇÈö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ İóíóæúãóÆöĞò íóÈúÚóËõåõ Çááåõ ãóŞóÇãğÇ ãóÍúãõæÏğÇ»</div><br>  (The sun will come close until the sweat reaches halfway up one's ears. When the people are in that state, they will ask Adam for help, and he will say, "I am not the one to do that.'' Then they will ask Musa, and he will say likewise, then they will ask Muhammad, and he will intercede for the people and will go and take hold of the handle of the gate of Paradise, and that will be the Day when Allah resurrects him to a position of praise and glory.)

Do you know why it will be so Allah will gather the first and the last in one place, and they will hear a voice calling out, and they will all be seen. The sun will come close until their anguish and distress becomes unbearable, and some will say to others, "Do you not see how much you are suffering Why do you not find someone to intercede for you with your Lord'' And some of the people will say to others, "How about Adam'' So they will go to Adam and say, "O Adam, you are the father of mankind, Allah created you with His Hand and breathed into you of His spirit, and commanded the angels to prostrate to you. Intercede for us with your Lord, do you not see the state we are in, how bad it is'' Adam will say, "My Lord is angry today in a way that He has never been angry before and He will never be this angry again. He forbade me to approach the Tree and I disobeyed Him. Myself, myself, myself i.e., I am only concerned about myself. Go to someone else. Go to Nuh.'' So they will go to Nuh and say, "O Nuh, you are the first of the Messengers sent to the people of earth, and Allah called you a grateful servant. Intercede for us with your Lord, do you not see the state we are in, how bad it is'' Nuh will say, "My Lord is angry today in a way that He has never been angry before and He will never be this angry again. There is a prayer that I prayed against my people. Myself, myself, myself i.e., I am only concerned about myself. Go to someone else. Go to Ibrahim. '' So they will go to Ibrahim and say, "O Ibrahim, you are the Prophet of Allah and His close Friend among the people of earth. Intercede for us with your Lord, do you not see the state we are in, how bad it is'' Ibrahim will say, "My Lord is angry today in a way that He has never been angry before and He will never be this angry again.'' And he mentioned some untruths he had told. "Myself, myself, myself i.e., I am only concerned about myself. Go to someone else. Go to Musa.''  So they will go to Musa and say, "O Musa, you are the Messenger of Allah, Allah chose you above others by selecting you to convey His Message and by speaking to you directly. Intercede for us with your Lord, do you not see the state we are in, how bad it is'' Musa will say, "My Lord is angry today in a way that He has never been angry before and He will never be this angry again. I killed a soul whom I had not been commanded to kill. Myself, myself, myself i.e., I am only concerned about myself. Go to someone else. Go to `Isa.'' So they will go to `Isa and say, `O `Isa, you are the Messenger of Allah and His Word which He bestowed upon Maryam and a spirit created by Him. You spoke to the people as an infant in the cradle. Intercede for us with your Lord, do you not see the state we are in, how bad it is'' `Isa will say, "My Lord is angry today in a way that He has never been angry before and He will never be this angry again.'' And he will not mention any sin. "Myself, myself, myself i.e., I am only concerned about myself. Go to someone else. Go to Muhammad.'' So they will go to Muhammad and will say, "O Muhammad, you are the Messenger of Allah and the Last of the Prophets, Allah forgave all your past and future sins. Intercede for us with your Lord, do you not see the state we are in, how bad it is'' I will stand up and come before the Throne, and will fall prostrating to my Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then Allah will inspire me to speak and I will speak beautiful words of praise such as no one has ever been inspired with before. It will be said, "O Muhammad, raise your head and ask, it will be granted to you. Intercede, and your intercession will be heard.'' So I will raise my head and say, "My Ummah, O Lord, my Ummah, O Lord, my Ummah, O Lord.'' It will be said, "O Muhammad, admit those who will not be brought to account from among your Ummah through the right-hand gate of Paradise. Then the rest of your Ummah will share the other gates with the rest of the people.'') Then he said, ("By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, the distance between two of the gateposts of Paradise is like the distance between Makkah and Hajar, or between Makkah and Busra.) It was also reported in the Two Sahihs.  </div></body></html>
