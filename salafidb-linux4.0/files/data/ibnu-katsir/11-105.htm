This means an admonition and lesson concerning the truthfulness of that which We are promised in the Hereafter.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ áóäóäÕõÑõ ÑõÓõáóäóÇ æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóíóæúãó íóŞõæãõ ÇáÇøñÔúåóÜÏõ </div><br>  .(Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in this world's life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth.)40:51  Allah, the Exalted, also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóæúÍóì Åöáóíúåöãú ÑóÈøõåõãú áóäõåúáößóäøó ÇáÙøóÜáöãöíäó</div><br>  (So their Lord revealed to them: "Truly, We shall destroy the wrongdoers.) 14:13 Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğáößó íóæúãñ ãøóÌúãõæÚñ áøóåõ ÇáäøóÇÓõ</div><br>  (That is a Day whereon mankind will be gathered together,) This means the first of them and the last of them. This is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÍóÔóÑúäóÜåõãú İóáóãú äõÛóÇÏöÑú ãöäúåõãú ÃóÍóÏÇğ</div><br>  (And We shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) 18: 47   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóĞóáößó íóæúãñ ãøóÔúåõæÏñ</div><br>  (and that is a Day when all will be present.) This means a day that is great. The angels will be present, the Messengers will gather and all of the creation will be gathered with their families. The humans, Jinns, birds, wild beasts and domesticated riding animals will all be gathered. Then the Most Just, Who does not wrong anyone even an atom's weight, will judge between them and He will increase their good deeds in reward. Concerning the statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ äõÄóÎøöÑõåõ ÅöáÇøó áÇøğÌóáò ãøóÚúÏõæÏò </div><br>  (And We delay it only for a term (already) fixed.) This means for a fixed period of time than cannot be increased or decreased. Then He says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóæúãó íóÃúÊö áÇó Êóßóáøóãõ äóİúÓñ ÅöáÇøó ÈöÅöĞúäöåö</div><br>  (On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His (Allah's) leave.) This means that on the Day of Judgement no one will speak except with the permission of Allah. This is similar to another verse, which says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇøó íóÊóßóáøóãõæäó ÅöáÇøó ãóäú ÃóĞöäó áóåõ ÇáÑøóÍúãóÜäõ æóŞóÇáó ÕóæóÇÈÇğ</div><br>  (they will not speak except him whom the Most Gracious (Allah) allows, and he will speak what is right.) 78:38 Allah also says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÎóÔóÚóÊö ÇáÃóÕúæóÇÊõ áöáÑøóÍúãóÜäö</div><br>  (And all the voices will be humbled for the Most Gracious (Allah). ) 20:108 In the Hadith about the intercession, which is recorded in the Two Sahihs, the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóáóÇ íóÊóßóáøóãõ íóæúãóÆöĞò ÅöáøóÇ ÇáÑøõÓõáõ¡ æóÏóÚúæóì ÇáÑøõÓõáö íóæúãóÆöĞò Çááøóåõãøó Óóáøöãú Óóáøöã»</div><br>  (No one will speak on that day except the Messengers, and the call of the Messengers will be, "O Allah, save us, save us.'') Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãöäúåõãú ÔóŞöìøñ æóÓóÚöíÏñ</div><br>  (Some among them will be wretched and (others) blessed.) This means that from the people of the gathering (on Judgement Day), some will be miserable and some will be happy. This is as Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÑöíŞñ İöì ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóİóÑöíŞñ İöì ÇáÓøóÚöíÑö</div><br>  (When a party will be in Paradise and a party in the blazing Fire) 42:7 Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la recorded in his Musnad on the authority of Ibn `Umar that `Umar said, "When this verse was revealed,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãöäúåõãú ÔóŞöìøñ æóÓóÚöíÏñ</div><br>  (Some among them will be wretched and (others) blessed.) I asked the Prophet , `O Messenger of Allah, will there be a sign for us to know (which party we are from) Will it be because of something that a person did, or something that he did not do' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Úóáóì ÔóíúÁò ŞóÏú İõÑöÛó ãöäúåõ íóÇ ÚõãóÑõ æóÌóÑóÊú Èöåö ÇáúÃóŞúáóÇãõ¡æóáóßöäú ßõáøñ ãõíóÓøóÑñ áöãóÇ ÎõáöŞó áóå»</div><br>  (O `Umar, it will be due to something that he did and the pens wrote it down. But every easy deed was created for its purpose (to be carried out).) Then Allah explains the situation of the wretched people and the happy people. He, the Exalted, says,  </div></body></html>
