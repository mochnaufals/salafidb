Allah said in another Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚóÜáöãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈö İóáÇó íõÙúåöÑõ Úóáóì ÛóíúÈöåö ÃóÍóÏÇğ </div><br>  ((He Alone is) the All-Knower of the Ghayb (Unseen), and He reveals to none His Ghayb.) 72:26 Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ßõäÊõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÇáúÛóíúÈó áÇóÓúÊóßúËóÑúÊõ ãöäó ÇáúÎóíúÑö</div><br>  (If I had the knowledge of the Ghayb (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth.) refers to money.

Ibn Jarir said, "And others said, `This means that if I know the Unseen then I would prepare for the years of famine during the prosperous years, and in the time of high cost, I would have prepared for it.''' `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam also commented on this Ayah;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ãóÓøóäöìó ÇáÓøõæÁõ</div><br>  ("and no evil should have touched me.
