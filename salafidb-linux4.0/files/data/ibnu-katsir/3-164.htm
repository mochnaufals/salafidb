Indeed, Allah conferred a great favor on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting unto them His verses (the Qur'an), and purifying them, and instructing them (in) the Book (the Qur'an) and Al-Hikmah the wisdom and the Sunnah, while before that they had been in manifest error.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Among the Qualities of Our Prophet Muhammad are Mercy and Kindness</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah addresses His Messenger and reminds him and the believers of the favor that He has made his heart and words soft for his Ummah, those who follow his command and refrain from what he prohibits.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöãóÇ ÑóÍúãóÉò ãøöäó Çááøóåö áöäÊó áóåõãú</div><br>  (And by the mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently) 3:159. meaning, who would have made you this kind, if it was not Allah's mercy for you and them. Qatadah said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöãóÇ ÑóÍúãóÉò ãøöäó Çááøóåö áöäÊó áóåõãú</div><br>  (And by the mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently) means, "With Allah's mercy you became this kind.'' Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that this, indeed, is the description of the behavior that Allah sent Muhammad with. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ÌóÂÁóßõãú ÑóÓõæáñ ãøöäú ÃóäİõÓößõãú ÚóÒöíÒñ Úóáóíúåö ãóÇ ÚóäöÊøõãú ÍóÑöíÕñ Úóáóíúßõãú ÈöÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÑóÁõæİñ ÑøóÍöíãñ </div><br>  (Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from among yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is anxious over you (to be rightly guided, to repent to Allah); for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful) 9:128. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæú ßõäúÊó İóÙøÇğ ÛóáöíÙó ÇáúŞóáúÈö áÇóäúİóÖøõæÇú ãöäú Íóæúáößó</div><br>  (And had you been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you;)  The severe person is he who utters harsh words, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÛóáöíÙó ÇáúŞóáúÈö</div><br>  (harsh-hearted) is the person whose heart is hard. Had this been the Prophet's behavior, "They would have scattered from around you. However, Allah gathered them and made you kind and soft with them, so that their hearts congregate around you.'' `Abdullah bin `Amr said that he read the description of the Messenger of Allah in previous Books, "He is not severe, harsh, obscene in the marketplace or dealing evil for evil. Rather, he forgives and pardons.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Order for Consultation and to Abide by it</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇÚúİõ Úóäúåõãú æóÇÓúÊóÛúİöÑú áóåõãú æóÔóÇæöÑúåõãú İöì ÇáÇøñãúÑö</div><br>  (So pardon them, and ask (Allah's) forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs.)  The Messenger of Allah used to ask his Companions for advice about various matters, to comfort their hearts, and so they actively implement the decision they reach. For instance, before the battle of Badr, the Prophet asked his Companions for if Muslims should intercept the caravan (led by Abu Sufyan). They said, "O Messenger of Allah! If you wish to cross the sea, we would follow you in it, and if you march forth to Barkul-Ghimad we would march with you. We would never say what the Children of Israel said to Musa, `So go, you and your Lord, and fight you two, we are sitting right here.' Rather, we say march forth and we shall march forth with you; and before you, and to your right and left shall we fight.'' The Prophet also asked them for their opinion about where they should set up camp at Badr. Al-Mundhir bin `Amr suggested to camp close to the enemy, for he wished to acquire martyrdom.  Concerning the battle of Uhud, the Messenger asked the Companions if they should fortify themselves in Al-Madinah or go out to meet the enemy, and the majority of them requested that they go out to meet the enemy, and he did. He also took their advice on the day of Khandaq (the Trench) about conducting a peace treaty with some of the tribes of Al-Ahzab (the Confederates), in return for giving them one-third of the fruits of Al-Madinah. However, Sa`d bin `Ubadah and Sa`d bin Mu`adh rejected this offer and the Prophet went ahead with their advice. The Prophet also asked them if they should attack the idolators on the Day of Hudaybiyyah, and Abu Bakr disagreed, saying, "We did not come here to fight anyone. Rather, we came to perform `Umrah.'' The Prophet agreed.  On the day of Ifk, (i.e. the false accusation), the Messenger of Allah said to them, "O Muslims! Give me your advice about some men who falsely accused my wife (`A'ishah). By Allah! I never knew of any evil to come from my wife. And they accused whom They accused he from whom I only knew righteous conduct, by Allah!'' The Prophet asked `Ali and Usamah about divorcing `A'ishah. In summary, the Prophet used to take his Companions' advice for battles and other important events.  Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúãõÓúÊóÔóÇÑõ ãõÄúÊóãóä»</div><br>  (The one whom advice is sought from is to be entrusted) tThis was recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i who graded it Hasan. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Trust in Allah After Taking the Decision</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöĞóÇ ÚóÒóãúÊó İóÊóæóßøóáú Úóáóì Çááøóåö</div><br>  (Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah,) means, if you conduct the required consultation and you then make a decision, trust in Allah over your decision,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúãõÊóæóßøöáöíäó</div><br>  (certainly, Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him)).

Ibn Jarir recorded that, Ibn `Abbas said that, this Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó áöäóÈöìøò Ãóäú íóÛõáøó</div><br>  (It is not for any Prophet to illegally take a part of the booty,) was revealed in connection with a red robe that was missing from the spoils of war of Badr. Some people said that the Messenger of Allah might have taken it. When this rumor circulated, Allah sent down,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ßóÇäó áöäóÈöìøò Ãóäú íóÛõáøó æóãóä íóÛúáõáú íóÃúÊö ÈöãóÇ Ûóáøó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö</div><br>  (It is not for any Prophet to illegally take a part of the booty, and whosoever is deceitful with the booty, he shall bring forth on the Day of Resurrection that which he took.)  This was also recorded by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who said "Hasan Gharib''. This Ayah exonerates the Messenger of Allah of all types of deceit and treachery, be it returning what was entrusted with him, dividing the spoils of war, etc.  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÛúáõáú íóÃúÊö ÈöãóÇ Ûóáøó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö Ëõãøó Êõæóİøóì ßõáøõ äóİúÓò ãøóÇ ßóÓóÈóÊú æóåõãú áÇó íõÙúáóãõæäó</div><br>  (and whosoever is deceitful with the booty, he shall bring forth on the Day of Resurrection that which he took. Then every person shall be paid in full what he has earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.)  This Ayah contains a stern warning and threat against Ghulul stealing from the booty, and there are also Hadiths, that prohibit such practice. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Malik Al-Ashja`i said that the Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÚúÙóãõ ÇáúÛõáõæáö ÚöäúÏó Çááåö ĞöÑóÇÚñ ãöäó ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ ÊóÌöÏõæä ÇáÑøóÌõáóíúäö ÌóÇÑóíúäö İöí ÇáúÃóÑúÖö Ãæ İöí ÇáÏøóÇÑö İóíóŞúØóÚõ ÃóÍóÏõåõãóÇ ãöäú ÍóÙøö ÕóÇÍöÈöå ĞöÑóÇÚğÇ¡ İóÅöĞóÇ ÇŞúÊóØóÚóåõ¡ ØõæøöŞóåõ ãöäú ÓóÈúÚö ÃóÑóÖöíäó Åöáì íóæúãö ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (The worst Ghulul (i.e. stealing) with Allah is a yard of land, that is, when you find two neighbors in a land or home and one of them illegally acquires a yard of his neighbor's land. When he does, he will be tied with it from the seven earths until the Day of Resurrection.)  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Humayd As-Sa`idi said, "The Prophet appointed a man from the tribe of Al-Azd, called Ibn Al-Lutbiyyah, to collect the Zakah. When he returned he said, `This (portion) is for you and this has been given to me as a gift.'

The Prophet then raised his hands till we saw the whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, `O Allah! Haven't I conveyed Your Message.')''  Hisham bin `Urwah added that Abu Humayd said, "I have seen him with my eyes and heard him with my ears, and ask Zayd bin Thabit.'' This is recorded in the Two Sahihs .  In the book of Ahkam of his Sunan, Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Mu`adh bin Jabal said, "The Messenger of Allah sent me to Yemen, but when I started on the journey, he sent for me to come back and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊóÏúÑöí áöãó ÈóÚóËúÊõ Åöáóíúßó¿ áóÇ ÊõÕöíÈóäøó ÔóíúÆğÇ ÈöÛóíúÑö ÅöĞúäöí¡ İóÅöäøóåõ Ûõáõæá»</div><br>  (Do you know why I summoned you back Do not take anything without my permission, for if you do, it will be Ghulul.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íóÛúáõáú íóÃúÊö ÈöãóÇ Ûóáøó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÜãóÉö</div><br>  (and whosoever deceives his companions over the booty, he shall bring forth on the Day of Resurrection that which he took).   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áöåĞóÇ ÏóÚóæúÊõßó İóÇãúÖö áöÚóãóáöß»</div><br>  (This is why I summoned you, so now go and fulfill your mission.)''

Imam Ahmad recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "During the day (battle) of Khaybar, several Companions of the Messenger of Allah came to him and said, `So-and-so died as a martyr, so-and-so died as a martyr.'

Rather, each will be treated according to his deeds. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Magnificent Blessing in the Advent of Our Prophet Muhammad</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Most High said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóŞóÏú ãóäøó Çááøóåõ Úóáóì ÇáúãõÄãöäöíäó ÅöĞú ÈóÚóËó İöíåöãú ÑóÓõæáÇğ ãøöäú ÃóäİõÓöåöãú</div><br>  (Indeed Allah conferred a great favor on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves,)  Meaning, from their own kind, so that it is possible for them to speak with him, ask him questions, associate with him, and benefit from him. Just as Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäú ÁÇíóÜÊöåö Ãóäú ÎóáóŞó áóßõã ãøöäú ÃóäİõÓößõãú ÃóÒúæóÌÇğ áøöÊóÓúßõäõæÇú ÅöáóíúåóÇ</div><br>  (And among His signs is that he created for them mates, that they may find rest in.)

Allah's favor is perfected when His Messenger to the people is from their own kind, so that they are able to talk to him and inquire about the meanings of Allah's Word.
