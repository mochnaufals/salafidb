Allah is the Wali (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darknesses into light. But as for those who disbelieve, their Awliya' (supporters and helpers) are Taghut (false deities and false leaders), they bring them out from light into darknesses. Those are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.)</div>  Allah stated that whoever follows what pleases Him, He will guide him to the paths of peace, that is Islam, or Paradise. Verily, Allah delivers His believing servants from the darkness of disbelief, doubt and hesitation, to the light of the plain, clear, explained, easy and unequivocal truth. He also stated that Shaytan is the supporter of the disbelievers who beautifies the paths of ignorance and misguidance that they follow, thus causing them to deviate from the true path into disbelief and wickedness.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæáóÜÆößó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈõ ÇáäøóÇÑö åõãú İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó</div><br>  (Those are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever.)  This is why Allah mentioned the light in the singular while mentioned the darkness in the plural, because truth is one, while disbelief comes as several types, all of which are false. Similarly, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó åóÜĞóÇ ÕöÑóØöí ãõÓúÊóŞöíãğÇ İóÇÊøóÈöÚõæåõ æóáÇó ÊóÊøóÈöÚõæÇú ÇáÓøõÈõáó İóÊóİóÑøóŞó Èößõãú Úóä ÓóÈöíáöåö Ğóáößõãú æóÕøóÜßõãú Èöåö áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÊøóŞõæäó </div><br>  (And verily, this is my straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may have Taqwa) 6:153,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáó ÇáÙøõáõãóÜÊö æóÇáäøõæÑó</div><br>  (And originated the darknesses and the light) 6:1, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÙöáóÜáõåõ Úóäö Çáúíóãöíäö</div><br>  (to the right and to the lefts) 16: 48.  There are many other Ayat on the subject that mention the truth in the singular and falsehood in the plural, because of falsehood's many divisions and branches.  </div></body></html>
