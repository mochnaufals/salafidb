He encouraged them, delivered to them the good news and ordered them not to despair of Allah's mercy. He ordered them to never give up hope in Allah, nor to ever discontinue trusting in Him for what they seek to accomplish. He said to them that only the disbelieving people despair of Allah's mercy. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Yusuf's Brothers stand before Him</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÏóÎóáõæÇú Úóáóíúåö</div><br>  (Then, when they entered unto him), when they went back to Egypt and entered upon Yusuf,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÇáõæÇú íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ãóÓøóäóÇ æóÃóåúáóäóÇ ÇáÖøõÑøõ</div><br>  (they said: "O Aziz!

Ibn Mas`ud read this Ayah in a way that means, "So give the full load on our animals and be charitable with us.'' Ibn Jurayj commented, "So be charitable to us by returning our brother to us.'' And when Sufyan bin `Uyaynah was asked if the Sadaqah (charity) was prohibited for any Prophet before our Prophet , he said, "Have you not heard the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóæúİö áóäóÇ Çáúßóíúáó æóÊóÕóÏøóŞú ÚóáóíúäóÂ Åöäøó Çááøóåó íóÌúÒöì ÇáúãõÊóÕóÏøöŞöíäó</div><br>  (so pay us full measure and be charitable to us.
