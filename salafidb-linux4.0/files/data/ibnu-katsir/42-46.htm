Whomever He guides, none can lead astray, and whomever He leads astray, none can guide, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóä íõÖúáöáú İóáóä ÊóÌöÏó áóåõ æóáöíøğÇ ãøõÑúÔöÏğÇ</div><br>  (but he whom He sends astray, for him you will find no protecting to lead him.) (18:17).

Mujahid said, "In a humiliated manner.'' That is, they will steal glances at it, because they will be afraid of it.
