By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóÇ ÌóÚóáúäóÜåõ</div><br>  (Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞõÑúÁóÇäÇğ ÚóÑóÈöíøÇğ</div><br>  (a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóÚúŞöáõæäó</div><br>  (that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÈöáöÓóÇäò ÚóÑóÈöìøò ãøõÈöíäò </div><br>  (In the plain Arabic language.)

This was the view of Qatadah and others.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áøóÚóáøöì</div><br>  (indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Íóßöíãñ</div><br>  (full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ áóŞõÑúÁóÇäñ ßóÑöíãñ - İöì ßöÊóÜÈò ãøóßúäõæäò - áÇøó íóãóÓøõåõ ÅöáÇøó ÇáúãõØóåøóÑõæäó - ÊóäÒöíáñ ãøöä ÑøóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation.

What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóßóãú ÃóÑúÓóáúäóÇ ãöä äøóÈöíøò İöì ÇáÇøñæøóáöíäó </div><br>  (And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ íóÃúÊöíåöã ãøöäú äøóÈöìøò ÅöáÇøó ßóÇäõæÇú Èöåö íóÓúÊóåúÒöÁõæäó </div><br>  (And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÃóåúáóßúäóÂ ÃóÔóÏøó ãöäúåõã ÈóØúÔÇğ</div><br>  (Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóİóáóãú íóÓöíÑõæÇú İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö İóíóäÙõÑõæÇú ßóíúİó ßóÇäó ÚóÜŞöÈóÉõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ãöä ŞóÈúáöåöãú ßóÇäõæÇú ÃóßúÜËóÑó ãöäúåõãú æóÃóÔóÏøó ŞõæøóÉğ</div><br>  (Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82).

Qatadah said, "Their punishment.'' Others said, "Their lesson,'' i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÌóÚóáúäóÜåõãú ÓóáóİÇğ æóãóËóáÇğ áøöáÇøñÎöÑöíäó </div><br>  (And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.)
