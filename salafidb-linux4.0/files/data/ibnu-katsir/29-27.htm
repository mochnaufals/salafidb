So, Lut believed in him. He said: "I will emigrate for the sake of my Lord. Verily, He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.'') (27.

It was said that he was the son of Ibrahim's brother, and that his name was Lut bin Haran bin Azar. None of Ibrahim's people believed in Ibrahim besides Lut and Sarah the wife of Ibrahim. But if it is asked how we may reconcile this Ayah with the Hadith narrated in the Sahih which says that when Ibrahim passed by that tyrant and he asked about Sarah and what her relationship was to him, Ibrahim said, "My sister.'' Then he went to her and said, "I told him that you are my sister, so do not let him think I am lying, for there are no believers on earth except for you and I, and you are my sister in faith.'' It seems -- and Allah knows best -- that the meaning here is, there is no other Muslim couple on earth apart from you and I. Among his people, only Lut believed in him and migrated with him to Syria, then during Ibrahim's lifetime he was sent as a Messenger to the people of Sadum (Sodom) where he settled. We have already discussed their story and more is to come.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóŞóÇáó Åöäøöì ãõåóÇÌöÑñ Åöáóì ÑóÈøöì</div><br>  (He (Ibrahim) said: "I will emigrate for the sake of my Lord.'') It may be that the pronoun in the verb "he said'' refers to Lut, because he was the last person mentioned before this phrase; or it may refer to Ibrahim. Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak said that Ibrahim is the one who is referred in the phrase.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÜóÇãóäó áóåõ áõæØñ</div><br>  (So, Lut believed in him.) i.e., out of all his people. Then Allah tells us that he chose to leave them so that he might be able to follow his religion openly. So he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ åõæó ÇáúÚóÒöíÒõ ÇáúÍóßöíãõ</div><br>  (Verily, He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.) Power belongs to Him and to His Messenger and to those who believe in him, and He is Wise in all that He says and does, and in all His rulings and decrees, both universal and legislative.  Qatadah said, "They migrated together from Kutha, which is on the outskirts of Kufa, and went to Syria.'' Allah gave Ibrahim, Ishaq and Ya`qub, and ordained Prophethood in His Offspring   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóåóÈúäóÇ áóåõ ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóíóÚúŞõæÈó</div><br>  (And We bestowed on him, Ishaq and Ya`qub,) This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóãøóÇ ÇÚúÊóÒóáóåõãú æóãóÇ íóÚúÈõÏõæäó ãöä Ïõæäö Çááøóåö æóåóÈúäóÇ áóåõ ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóíóÚúŞõæÈó æóßõáÇøğ ÌóÚóáúäóÇ äóÈöíøÇğ </div><br>  (So, when he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Ya`qub, and each one of them We made a Prophet.) (19:49) That is, when he left his people, Allah gave him joy in a righteous son who was also a Prophet, to whom in turn was born, in his grandfather's lifetime, a righteous son who was also a Prophet. Allah also says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóæóåóÈúäóÇ áóåõ ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóíóÚúŞõæÈó äóÇİöáóÉğ</div><br>  (And We bestowed upon him Ishaq, and Ya`qub in addition) (21:72) meaning, as an additional gift. This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈóÔøóÑúäóÜåóÇ ÈöÅöÓúÍóÜŞó æóãöä æóÑóÂÁö ÅöÓúÍóÜŞó íóÚúŞõæÈó</div><br>  (But We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq, and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub.) (11:71) meaning, to this son would be born a son during their lives, who would be a delight to them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÌóÚóáúäóÇ İöì ĞõÑøöíøóÊöåö ÇáäøõÈõæøóÉó æóÇáúßöÊóÜÈó</div><br>  (and We ordained among his offspring prophethood and the Book,) This is a tremendous blessing. Not only did Allah take him as a close friend and make him an Imam for mankind, but He also ordained prophethood and the Book among his offspring. After the time of Ibrahim there was no Prophet who was not from among his descendants. All of the Prophets of the Children of Israel were from among his descendants, from Ya`qub bin Ishaq bin Ibrahim to the last of them, `Isa bin Maryam, who stood in the midst of his people and announced the good news of the Hashimi Qurashi Arab Prophet, the last of all the Messengers, the leader of the sons of Adam in this world and the next, whom Allah chose from the heart of the Arab nation, from the descendants of Isma`il bin Ibrahim, may peace be upon them. There is no Prophet from the line of Isma`il besides him, may the best of blessings and peace be upon him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóíúäóÇåõ ÃóÌúÑóåõ İöì ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÅöäøóåõ İöì áÇøñÎöÑóÉö áóãöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó</div><br>  (and We granted him his reward in this world; and verily, in the Hereafter he is indeed among the righteous.) Allah granted him happiness in this world that was connected to happiness in the Hereafter, for in this world he had plentiful provision, a splendid home, a beautiful and righteous wife, and he was and still is spoken of highly, for everyone loves him and regards him as a friend. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others said: "He obeyed Allah in all ways.'' This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöÈúÑóåöíãó ÇáøóĞöì æóİøóì </div><br>  (And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all.) (53:37) He did all that he was commanded to do and obeyed his Lord to the utmost. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊóíúäóÇåõ ÃóÌúÑóåõ İöì ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóÅöäøóåõ İöì áÇøñÎöÑóÉö áóãöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó</div><br>  (and We granted him his reward in this world; and verily, in the Hereafter he is indeed among the righteous.) And He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÅöÈúÑóåöíãó ßóÇäó ÃõãøóÉğ ŞóÜäöÊğÇ áöáøóåö ÍóäöíİğÇ æóáóãú íóßõ ãöäó ÇáúãõÔúÑößöíäó </div><br>  (Verily, Ibrahim was an Ummah, Qanit to Allah, a Hanif, and he was not one of the idolators) until:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóåõ İöì ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö áóãöäó ÇáÕøóÜáöÍöíäó</div><br>  (and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous) (16:120-122).  </div></body></html>
