Mujahid and Qatadah said: "He will be among those who are punished.'' It was said that this was revealed concerning the Messenger of Allah and Abu Jahl, or that it was revealed concerning Hamzah and Ali, and Abu Jahl. Both views were narrated from Mujahid. The apparent meaning is that it is more general than that. This is like the Ayah where Allah describes a believer in Paradise looking out at his companion who is in Hell, and saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóæúáÇó äöÚúãóÉõ ÑóÈøöì áóßõäÊõ ãöäó ÇáúãõÍúÖóÑöíäó </div><br>  (Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell).)
