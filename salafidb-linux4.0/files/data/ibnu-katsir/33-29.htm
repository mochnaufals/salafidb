O Prophet! Say to your wives: "If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner.'') (29. "But if you desire Allah and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you an enormous reward.'')</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Giving the Wives of the Prophet Õáì Çááå Úáíå æÓáã the Choice</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Here Allah commands His Messenger to give his wives the choice of separating from him so that they may go to someone else with whom they can find what they want of the life of this world and its attractions, or of patiently bearing the straitened circumstances with the Prophet for which they will have a great reward with Allah. They chose Allah and His Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter, may Allah be pleased with them. Then Allah gave them the best both of this world and of the Hereafter. Al-Bukhari narrated from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, the wife of the Prophet that the Messenger of Allah came to her when Allah commanded him to give his wives the choice. She said, "The Messenger of Allah started with me, and said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí ĞóÇßöÑñ áóßö ÃóãúÑğÇ İóáóÇ Úóáóíúßö Ãóäú ÊóÓúÊóÚúÌöáöí ÍóÊúì ÊóÓúÊóÃúãöÑöí ÃóÈóæóíúß»</div><br>  (I am going to tell you about something and you do not have to hasten to respond until you consult your parents.)'' He knew that my parents would never tell me to leave him. Then he said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì ŞóÇáó:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÈöìøõ Şõá áÇøñÒúæóÌößó»</div><br>  (Allah says: ("O Prophet! Say to your wives...'')) and he recited the two Ayat. I said to him, "Concerning what do I need to consult my parents I choose Allah and His Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter.'' He also narrated it without a chain of narrators, and added, "She said, then all the wives of the Prophet did the same as I.'' Imam Ahmad recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: "The Messenger of Allah gave us the choice, and we chose him, so giving us that choice was not regarded as divorce.'' It was recorded by (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Hadith of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him, said: "Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, came to ask permission to see the Messenger of Allah and the people were sitting at his door, and the Prophet was sitting, but he did not give him permission. Then `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, came and asked permission to see him, but he did not give him permission. Then he gave Abu Bakr and `Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both, permission, and they entered. The Prophet was sitting with his wives around him, and he was silent. `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `I will tell the Prophet something to make him smile.' `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, `O Messenger of Allah, if only you had seen the daughter of Zayd -- the wife of `Umar -- asking me to spend on her just now; I broke her neck!' The Messenger of Allah smiled so broadly that his molars could be seen, and he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«åõäøó Íóæúáöí íóÓúÃóáúäóäöí ÇáäøóİóŞóÉ»</div><br>  (They are around me asking me to spend on them.) Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, got up to deal with `A'ishah; and `Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, got up to deal with Hafsah, and both of them were saying, `You are asking the Prophet for that which he does not have!' But the Messenger of Allah stopped them, and they (his wives) said, `By Allah, after this we will not ask the Messenger of Allah for anything that he does not have.' Then Allah revealed the Ayah telling him to give them the choice, and he started with `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her. He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøöí ÃóĞúßõÑõ áóßö ÃóãúÑğÇ ãóÇ ÃõÍöÈøõ Ãóäú ÊóÚúÌóáöí İöíåö ÍóÊøóì ÊóÓúÊóÃúãöÑöí ÃóÈóæóíúß»</div><br>  (I am going to tell you something, and I would like you not to hasten to respond until you consult your parents.) She said, `What is it' He recited to her:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÈöìøõ Şõá áÇøñÒúæóÌößó</div><br>  (O Prophet! Say to your wives...) `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, `Do I need to consult my parents concerning you I choose Allah and His Messenger, but I ask you not to tell of my choice to your other wives.' He said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó Çááåó ÊóÚóÇáóì áóãú íóÈúÚóËúäöí ãõÚóäøöİğÇ¡ æóáóßöäú ÈóÚóËóäöí ãõÚóáøöãğÇ ãõíóÓøöÑğÇ¡ áóÇ ÊóÓúÃóáõäöí ÇãúÑóÃóÉñ ãöäúåõäøó ÚóãøóÇ ÇÎúÊóÑúÊö ÅöáøóÇ ÃóÎúÈóÑúÊõåóÇ»</div><br>  (Allah did not send me to be harsh, but He sent me to teach in a gentle and easy manner. If any of them asks me what your decision was, I will tell her.)'' This was also recorded by Muslim, but not Al-Bukhari; An-Nasa'i also recorded it. `Ikrimah said: "At that time he was married to nine women, five of them were from Quraysh -- `A'ishah, Hafsah. Umm Habibah, Sawdah and Umm Salamah, may Allah be pleased with them. And he was also married to Safiyyah bint Huyay An-Nadariyyah, Maymunah bint Al-Harith Al-Hilaliyyah, Zaynab bint Jahsh Al-Asadiyyah and Juwayriyyah bint Al-Harith Al-Mustalaqiyyah, may Allah be pleased with all of them.  </div></body></html>
