The leader of all people in this regard and in all regards is Muhammad the Messenger of Allah , for he undertook to convey the Message to the people of the east and of the west, to all kinds of the sons of Adam, so Allah caused his word, his religion and his law to prevail over all other religions and laws. The Prophets before him were sent only to their own peoples, but he was sent to all of mankind, Arabs and non-Arabs alike.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú íóÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáäøóÇÓõ Åöäøöì ÑóÓõæáõ Çááøóåö Åöáóíúßõãú ÌóãöíÚğÇ</div><br>  (Say: "O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah'') (7:158). Then his Ummah inherited the task of conveying from him, and the greatest of those who undertook this task after him were his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, who conveyed from him as he had commanded them, describing all his words, deeds and circumstances, night and day, when he was settled and when he was traveling, in private and in public, may Allah be pleased with them. Thereafter each generation inherited from their predecessors until our own time, so those who are guided, follow their example and their way. We ask Allah, the Most Generous Bestower, to make us among their heirs. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Messenger is not the Father of any Man</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah states:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãøóÇ ßóÇäó ãõÍóãøóÏñ ÃóÈóÂ ÃóÍóÏò ãøä ÑøöÌóÇáößõãú</div><br>  (Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,) After this it was not permitted to say Zayd bin Muhammad, i.e., he was not his father even though he had adopted him. No male child of the Prophet lived until puberty. Khadijah, may Allah be pleased with her, bore him Al-Qasim, At-Tayyib and At-Tahir, but they died in childhood. Mariyah Al-Qibtiyyah bore him Ibrahim, but he also died in infancy. He also had four daughters from Khadijah: Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah, may Allah be pleased with them all. Three of them died during his lifetime, Fatimah lived long enough to be bereaved of him, then she died six months later. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>He is the Last of the Prophets</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöä ÑøóÓõæáó Çááøóåö æóÎóÇÊóãó ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó æóßóÇäó Çááøóåõ Èößõáøö ÔóìúÁò ÚóáöíãÇğ</div><br>  (but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets.

This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Çááøóåõ ÃóÚúáóãõ ÍóíúËõ íóÌúÚóáõ ÑöÓóÇáóÊóåõ</div><br>  (Allah knows best with whom to place His Message) (6:124). This Ayah clearly states that there will be no Prophet after him. If there will be no Prophet after him then there will surely be no Messenger after him either, because the status of a Messenger is higher than that of a Prophet, for every Messenger is a Prophet but the reverse is not the case. This was reported in many Mutawatir Hadiths narrated from the Messenger of Allah via a group of his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them. Imam Ahmad recorded a narration from Ubayy bin Ka`b, from his father that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóËóáöí İöí ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó ßóãóËóáö ÑóÌõáò Èóäóì ÏóÇÑğÇ İóÃóÍúÓóäóåóÇ æóÃóßúãóáóåóÇ¡ æóÊóÑóßó İöíåóÇ ãóæúÖöÚó áóÈöäóÉò áóãú íóÖóÚúåóÇ¡ İóÌóÚóáó ÇáäøóÇÓõ íóØõæİõæäó ÈöÇáúÈõäúíóÇäö æóíóÚúÌóÈõæäó ãöäúåõ æóíóŞõæáõæäó: áóæú Êóãøó ãóæúÖöÚõ åóĞöåö ÇááøóÈöäóÉö¡ İóÃóäóÇ İöí ÇáäøóÈöíøöíäó ãóæúÖöÚõ Êöáúßó ÇááøóÈöäóÉ»</div><br>  (My parable among the Prophets is that of a man who built a house and did a good and complete job, apart from the space of one brick which he did not put in its place.

It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim and At-Tirmidhi, who said, "It is Sahih Gharib with this chain of narrators.'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Another Hadith</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóËóáöí æóãóËóáõ ÇáäøóÜÜÈöííäó ßóãóËóáö ÑóÌõáò Èóäóì ÏóÇÑğÇ İóÃóÊóãøóåóÇ ÅöáøóÇ áóÈöäóÉğ æóÇÍöÏóÉğ¡ İóÌöÆúÊõ ÃóäóÇ İóÃóÊúãóãúÊõ Êöáúßó ÇááøóÈöäóÉ»</div><br>  (The parable of myself and the Prophets is that of a man who built a house and completed it apart from the space of one brick.

It was also recorded in the Two Sahihs. And there are many other Hadiths on this topic. Allah has told us in His Book, and His Messenger has told us in the Mutawatir Sunnah, that there will be no Prophet after him, so that it may be known that everyone who claims this status after him is a liar and fabricator who is misguided and is misguiding others. Even if he twists meanings, comes up with false claims and uses tricks and vagaries, all of this is false and is misguidance as will be clear to those who have understanding. This is what Allah caused to happen in the case of Al-Aswad Al-`Ansi in the Yemen and Musaylimah the Liar in Al-Yamamah, whose false miracles and nonsensical words showed everyone who was possessed of understanding that they were liars who were leading people astray; may the curse of Allah be upon them both. This is the case with every false prophet until the Day of Resurrection, until they end with Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal (the Antichrist). Each of these liars is given by Allah signs which show the people of knowledge and the believers that his message is false -- which is part of the perfect kindness of Allah towards His creation. These liars do not enjoin what is good, nor forbid what is evil, unless they do so by coincidence or because it serves an ulterior purpose. They are the utmost in falsehood and immorality, in all that they say and do, as Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åóáú ÃõäóÈøöÆõßõãú Úóáóì ãóä ÊóäóÒøóáõ ÇáÔøóíóÜØöíäõ - ÊóäóÒøóáõ Úóáóì ßõáøö ÃóİøóÇßò ÃóËöíãò </div><br>  (Shall I inform you (O people!) upon whom the Shayatin descend They descend on every lying, sinful person.) (26:221-222) This is in contrast to the Prophets -- may blessings and peace be upon them -- for they are the utmost in righteousness, truthfulness, wisdom, uprightness and justice in all that they say and do, command and forbid. In addition to this they are supported with miracles and clear and obvious proof. May the blessings and peace of Allah be upon them always, as long as heaven and earth remain.  </div></body></html>
