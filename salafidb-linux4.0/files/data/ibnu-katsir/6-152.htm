When any of that food or drink remained, they used to keep it for the orphan until he or she ate it or it spoiled. This became difficult for the companions and they talked about it to the Messenger of Allah , and Allah sent down the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÓúÜóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáúíóÊóÜãóì Şõáú ÅöÕúáÇóÍñ áøóåõãú ÎóíúÑñ æóÅöä ÊõÎóÇáöØõæåõãú İóÅöÎúæóäõßõãú</div><br>  (And they ask you about orphans. Say: "The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers.") 2:220 Thereafter, they mixed their food and drink with food and drink of the orphans.'' Abu Dawud collected this statement. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÍóÊøóì íóÈúáõÛó ÃóÔõÏøóåõ</div><br>  (until he (or she) attains the age of full strength;), refers to reaching the age of adolescence, according to Ash-Sha`bi, Malik and several others among the Salaf. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Command to Give Full Measure and Full Weight with Justice</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóæúİõæÇú Çáúßóíúáó æóÇáúãöíÒóÇäó ÈöÇáúŞöÓúØö</div><br>  (and give full measure and full weight with justice.) is a command to establish justice while giving and taking. Allah has also warned against abandoning this commandment, when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíúáñ áøöáúãõØóİøöİöíäó - ÇáøóĞöíäó ÅöĞóÇ ÇßúÊóÇáõæÇú Úóáóì ÇáäøóÇÓö íóÓúÊóæúİõæäó - æóÅöĞóÇ ßóÇáõæåõãú Ãóæú æøóÒóäõæåõãú íõÎúÓöÑõæäó - ÃóáÇ íóÙõäøõ ÃõæúáóÜÆößó Ãóäøóåõãú ãøóÈúÚõæËõæäó - áöíóæúãò ÚóÙöíãò - íóæúãó íóŞõæãõ ÇáäøóÇÓõ áöÑóÈøö ÇáúÚóÜáóãöíäó </div><br>  (Woe to Al-Mutaffifin. Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, demand full measure. And when they have to give by measure or weight to (other) men, give less than due. Do they not think that they will be resurrected (for reckoning). On a Great Day The Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of all that exists) 83:1-6. Allah destroyed an entire nation that was accustomed to giving less in weights and measures. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áÇó äõßóáøöİõ äóİúÓğÇ ÅöáÇøó æõÓúÚóåóÇ</div><br>  (We burden not any person, but that which he can bear.) that is, whoever strives while pursuing his rights and giving other peoples' full rights, then there is no sin on him if he commits an honest mistake after trying his best and striving to do what is right. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Order for Just Testimony</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ŞõáúÊõãú İóÇÚúÏöáõæÇú æóáóæú ßóÇäó ĞóÇ ŞõÑúÈóì</div><br>  (And whenever you give your word, say the truth even if a near relative is concerned.) This is similar to His statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÜÃóíøõåóÂ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ßõæäõæÇú ŞóæøóÇãöíäó ááøóåö ÔõåóÏóÂÁó ÈöÇáúŞöÓúØö</div><br>  (O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah as just witnesses.) 5:8  And there is a similar Ayah in Surat An-Nisa'. So Allah commands justice in action and statement, with both near relatives and distant relatives. Indeed, Allah orders justice for everyone at all times and in all situations. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Fulfilling the Covenant of Allah is an Obligation</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÈöÚóåúÏö Çááøóåö ÃóæúİõæÇú</div><br>  (and fulfill the Covenant of Allah.) Ibn Jarir commented, "Allah commands: Fulfill Allah's commandments that He has ordered you. You will do so when you obey Him in what He commanded, refrain from what He prohibited and abide by His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger . This constitutes fulfilling the covenant of Allah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößõãú æóÕøóÜßõãú Èöåö áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (...This He commands you, that you may remember.) Allah says here, that this is what He has ordered and commanded, and He stressed its importance for you,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÚóáøóßõãú ÊóĞóßøóÑõæäó</div><br>  (...that you may remember.), that you may be advised and thus refrain from what you used to do before this.''  </div></body></html>
