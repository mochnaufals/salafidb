In this Ayah, Allah describes darkness in the plural, Zulumat where Zulmah is singular for darkness, while describing the light in the singular, An-Nur, because An-Nur is more honored. In other Ayat, Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÙöáóÜáõåõ Úóäö Çáúíóãöíäö</div><br>  (To the right and to the lefts.) 16:48 Near the end of this Surah (chapter 6), Allah also said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóäøó åóÜĞóÇ ÕöÑóØöí ãõÓúÊóŞöíãğÇ İóÇÊøóÈöÚõæåõ æóáÇó ÊóÊøóÈöÚõæÇú ÇáÓøõÈõáó İóÊóİóÑøóŞó Èößõãú Úóä ÓóÈöíáöåö</div><br>  (And verily, this is my straight path, so follow it, and follow no (other) ways, for they will separate you away from His way.) 6:153 Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëúãøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÈöÑóÈøöåöãú íóÚúÏöáõæäó</div><br>  (Yet those who disbelieve hold others as equal with their Lord.) meaning, in spite of all this, some of Allah's servants disbelieve in Him and hold others as partners and rivals with Him. Some of Allah's servants claimed a wife and a son for Allah, hallowed be He far above what they attribute to Him. Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>åõæó ÇáøóĞöì ÎóáóŞóßõãú ãøöä Øöíäò</div><br>  (He it is Who has created you from clay,) refers to the father of mankind, Adam, from whom mankind originated, multiplied in numbers and spread about, east and west. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ŞóÖóì ÃóÌóáÇğ æóÃóÌóáñ ãøõÓãøğì ÚöäÏóåõ</div><br>  (Then has decreed a stated term. And there is with Him another determined term...) His saying;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ŞóÖóì ÃóÌóáÇğ</div><br>  (Then has decreed a stated term,) refers to death, while,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÌóáñ ãøõÓãøğì ÚöäÏóåõ</div><br>  (And there is with Him another determined term...) refers to the Hereafter, according to Sa`id bin Jubayr who reported this from Ibn `Abbas. Similar statements were narrated from Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Zayd bin Aslam, `Atiyyah, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan and others. Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid said that,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ŞóÖóì ÃóÌóáÇğ</div><br>  (And then has decreed a stated term,) is the term of this earthly life, while,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÌóáñ ãøõÓãøğì ÚöäÏóåõ</div><br>  (And there is with Him another determined term) refers to man's extent of life until he dies as mentioned in Allah's statement;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì íóÊóæóİøóÜßõã ÈöÇáøóíúáö æóíóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ ÌóÑóÍúÊõã ÈöÇáäøóåóÇÑö</div><br>  (It is He, Who takes your souls by night (when you are asleep), and has knowledge of all that you have done by day, then He raises (wakes) you up again that a term appointed (life) be fulfilled.) 6:60 The meaning of Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÚöäÏóåõ</div><br>  (With Him) is that none but Him knows when it will occur. Allah said in other Ayat,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöäøóãóÇ ÚöáúãõåóÇ ÚöäúÏó ÑóÈøöí áÇó íõÌóáøöíåóÇ áöæóŞúÊöåóÂ ÅöáÇøó åõæó</div><br>  (The knowledge thereof is with my Lord. None can reveal its time but He.) 7:187, and,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÃóáõæäóßó Úóäö ÇáÓøóÇÚóÉö ÃóíøóÇäó ãõÑúÓóÜåóÇ - İöíãó ÃóäÊó ãöä ĞößúÑóÇåóÇ - Åöáóì ÑóÈøößó ãõäÊóåóÜåóÂ </div><br>  (They ask you about the Hour -- when will be its appointed time You have no knowledge to say anything about it. To your Lord belongs (the knowledge of) the term thereof.) 79:42-44 Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÃóäÊõãú ÊóãúÊóÑõæäó</div><br>  (Yet you doubt.) the coming of the (last) Hour, according to As-Suddi. Allah said next,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó Çááøóåõ İöì ÇáÓøóãóÜæóÊö æóİöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö íóÚúáóãõ ÓöÑøóßõãú æóÌóåúÑóßõãú æóíóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ ÊóßúÓöÈõæäó </div><br>  (And He is Allah in the heavens and the earth, He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn.) Meaning, it is He Who is called Allah, throughout the heavens and the earth, that is, it is He who is worshipped, singled out, whose divinity is believed in by the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. They call Him Allah, and they supplicate to Him in fear and hope, except those who disbelieve among the Jinns and mankind. In another Ayah, Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÇáøóĞöì İöì ÇáÓøóãÂÁö ÅöáóÜåñ æóİöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ÅöáóÜåñ</div><br>  (It is He Who is God in the heavens and the earth.)43:84 meaning, He is the God of those in heaven and those on earth, and He knows all affairs, public and secret.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíóÚúáóãõ ãóÇ ÊóßúÓöÈõæäó</div><br>  (And He knows what you earn) all the good and bad deeds that you perform.  </div></body></html>
