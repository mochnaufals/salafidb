And that I had never known how my account is! Would that it had been my end!...'') Ad-Dahhak said, "Meaning a death which is not followed by any life.'' Likewise said Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ar-Rabi` and As-Suddi. Qatadah said, "He will hope for death even though in the worldly life it was the most hated thing to him.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÂ ÃóÛúäóì Úóäøöì ãóÇáöíóåú - åóáóßó Úóäøöì ÓõáúØóÜäöíóåú </div><br>  (My wealth has not availed me; my power has gone from me.) means, `my wealth and my honor did not protect me from the punishment of Allah and His torment. Now the matter has ended with me alone and I have no helper nor anyone to save me.' At this Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎõĞõæåõ İóÛõáøõæåõ - Ëõãøó ÇáúÌóÍöíãó Õóáøõæåõ </div><br>  (Seize him and fetter him; then throw him in the blazing Fire.) meaning, He will command the guardians of Hell to forcibly remove him from the gathering place, fetter him - meaning put iron collars on his neck - then carry him off to Hell and cast him into it, meaning they will submerge him in it. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó İöì ÓöáúÓöáóÉò ĞóÑúÚõåóÇ ÓóÈúÚõæäó ĞöÑóÇÚÇğ İóÇúÓúáõßõæåõ </div><br>  (Then fasten him on a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits!) Ka`b Al-Ahbar said, "Every ring of it will be equal to the entire amount of iron found in this world.'' Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas and Ibn Jurayj both said, "Each cubit will be the forearm's length of an angel.'' Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn `Abbas said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÇúÓúáõßõæåõ</div><br>  (Then fasten him) "It will be entered into his buttocks and pulled out of his mouth. Then they will be arranged on this (chain) just like locusts are arranged on a stick that is being roasted.'' Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, "It will be ran into his behind until it is brought out of his two nostrils so he will not be able to stand on his two feet.'' Imam Ahmad recorded from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóæú Ãóäøó ÑóÕóÇÕóÉğ ãöËúáó åĞöåö æÃÔÇÑ Åáì ÌõãúÌõãóÉò ÃõÑúÓöáóÊú ãöäó ÇáÓøóãóÇÁö Åöáóì ÇáúÃóÑúÖö¡ æóåöíó ãóÓöíÑóÉõ ÎóãúÓöãöÇÆóÉö ÓóäóÉò¡ áóÈóáóÛóÊö ÇáúÃóÑúÖó ŞóÈúáó Çááøóíúáö æóáóæú ÃóäøóåóÇ ÃõÑúÓöáóÊú ãöäú ÑóÃúÓö ÇáÓøöáúÓöáóÉö áóÓóÇÑóÊú ÃóÑúÈóÚöíäó ÎóÑöíİğÇ Çááøóíúáó æóÇáäøóåóÇÑó ŞóÈúáó Ãóäú ÊóÈúáõÛó ŞóÚúÑóåóÇ Ãóæú ÃóÕúáóåóÇ»</div><br>  (If a drop of lead like this - and he pointed to a skull bone - were sent from the heaven to the earth, and it is a distance of five hundred years travel, it would reach the earth before night. And if it (the same drop of lead) were sent from the head of the chain (of Hell), it would travel forty fall seasons, night and day, before it would reach its (Hell's) cavity or base.) At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith and he said, "This Hadith is Hasan.'' Concerning Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøóåõ ßóÇäó áÇó íõÄúãöäõ ÈöÇááøóåö ÇáúÚóÙöíãö - æóáÇó íóÍõÖøõ Úóáóì ØóÚóÇãö ÇáúãöÓúßöíäö </div><br>  (Verily, he used not to believe in Allah, the Most Great, and urged not on the feeding of the poor.) meaning, he did not establish the right of Allah upon him, of obedience to Him and performing His worship. He also did not benefit Allah's creation nor did he give them their rights. For verily, Allah has a right upon the servants that they worship Him alone and not associate anything with Him. The servants of Allah also have a right upon each other to good treatment and assistance in righteousness and piety. For this reason, Allah commanded performance of the prayer and the payment of Zakah. When the Prophet was (in his last moments) near death he said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó æóãóÇ ãóáóßóÊú ÃóíúãóÇäõßõã»</div><br>  (The prayer (As-Salah) and your right hand possessions (i.e., slaves).) Allah says,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáóíúÓó áóåõ Çáúíóæúãó åóÜåõäóÇ Íóãöíãñ - æóáÇó ØóÚóÇãñ ÅöáÇøó ãöäú ÛöÓúáöíäò - áÇøó íóÃúßõáõåõ ÅöáÇøó ÇáúÎóÜØöÆõæäó </div><br>  (So no friend has he here this Day. Nor any food except filth from the washing of wounds. None will eat it except the Khati'un.) meaning, there is no one today who can save him from the punishment of Allah, nor any close friend or intercessor whose request would be honored. He will have no food here except for the filthy washing of wounds. Qatadah said, "It will be the worst food of the people of the Hellfire.'' Ar-Rabi` and Ad-Dahhak both said, "It (Ghislin) is a tree in Hell.'' Shabib bin Bishr reported from `Ikrimah that Ibn `Abbas said, `Ghislin will be the blood and fluid that will flow from their flesh.'' `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, `Ghislin is the pus of the people of the Hellfire.''  </div></body></html>
