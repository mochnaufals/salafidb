He tells us:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú ÍóÑøóãúäóÇ ãóÇ ŞóÕóÕúäóÇ Úóáóíúßó ãöä ŞóÈúáõ</div><br>  (And for those who are Jews, We have forbidden such things as We have mentioned to you before.) meaning in Surat Al-An`am, where Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÚóáóì ÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú ÍóÑøóãúäóÇ ßõáøó Ğöì ÙõİõÑò æóãöäó ÇáúÈóŞóÑö æóÇáúÛóäóãö ÍóÑøóãúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ÔõÍõæãóåõãóÂ ÅöáÇøó ãóÇ ÍóãóáóÊú ÙõåõæÑõåõãóÂ</div><br>  (And unto those who are Jews, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their backs) Until,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÕóÜÏöŞõæäó</div><br>  (We are indeed truthful) 6:146 Hence Allah says here:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÇ ÙóáóãúäóÜåõãú</div><br>  (And We did not wrong them,) meaning, in the restrictions that We imposed upon them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáóÜßöä ßóÇäõæÇú ÃóäİõÓóåõãú íóÙúáöãõæäó</div><br>  (but they wronged themselves. ) meaning, they deserved that. This is like the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÈöÙõáúãò ãøöäó ÇáøóĞöíäó åóÇÏõæÇú ÍóÑøóãúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ØóíøöÈóÜÊò ÃõÍöáøóÊú áóåõãú æóÈöÕóÏøöåöãú Úóä ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö ßóËöíÑÇğ </div><br>  (Because of the wrong committed of those who were Jews, We prohibited certain good foods which had been lawful for them - and (also) for their hindering many from Allah's way.) (4:160) Then Allah tells us, honoring and remin- ding believers who have sinned of His blessings, that who- ever among them repents, He will accept his repentance, as He says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó áöáøóĞöíäó ÚóãöáõæÇú ÇáÓøõæÁó ÈöÌóåóÜáóÉò</div><br>  (Then, your Lord for those who did evil out of ignorance) Some of the Salaf said that this means that everyone who disobeys Allah is ignorant.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÊóÇÈõæÇú ãöä ÈóÚúÏö Ğóáößó æóÃóÕúáóÍõæÇú</div><br>  (and afterward repent and do righteous deeds) meaning, they give up the sins they used to commit and turn to doing acts of obedience to Allah.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÑóÈøóßó ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåóÇ</div><br>  (verily, after that, your Lord is...) means, after that mistake   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÛóİõæÑñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (...Pardoning, Most Merciful.)  </div></body></html>
