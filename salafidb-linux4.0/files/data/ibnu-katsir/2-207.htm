Ibn `Abbas narrated that these Ayat were revealed about some of the hypocrites who criticized Khubayb and his companions who were killed during the Raji` incident. Thereafter, Allah sent down His condemnation of the hypocrites and His praise for Khubayb and his companions:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íóÔúÑöì äóİúÓóåõ ÇÈúÊöÛóÂÁó ãóÑúÖóÇÊö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.)  It was also said that they refer to the hypocrites and the believers in general. This is the opinion of Qatadah, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and several others, and it is correct.  Ibn Jarir related that Al-Qurazi said that Nawf Al-Bikali, who used to read (previous Divine) Books said, "I find the description of some members of this Ummah in the previously revealed Books of Allah: they (hypocrites) are people who use the religion to gain material benefit. Their tongues are sweeter than honey, but their hearts are more bitter than Sabir (a bitter plant, aloe). They show the people the appearance of sheep while their hearts hide the viciousness of wolves. Allah said, `They dare challenge Me, but they are deceived by Me. I swear by Myself that I will send a Fitnah (trial, calamity) on them that will make the wise man bewildered.' I contemplated about these statements and found them in the Qur'an describing the hypocrites:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íõÚúÌöÈõßó Şóæúáõåõ İöì ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ æóíõÔúåöÏõ Çááøóåó Úóáóì ãóÇ İöì ŞóáúÈöåö</div><br>  (And of mankind there is he whose speech may please you (O Muhammad ), in this worldly life, and he calls Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart,)  This statement by Al-Qurazi is Hasan Sahih. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóíõÔúåöÏõ Çááøóåó Úóáóì ãóÇ İöì ŞóáúÈöåö</div><br>  (...and he calls Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart,)  This Ayah indicates that such people pretend to be Muslims, but defy Allah by the disbelief and hypocrisy that their hearts conceal. Similarly Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íóÓúÊóÎúİõæäó ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö æóáÇó íóÓúÊóÎúİõæäó ãöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (They may hide (their crimes) from men, but they cannot hide (them) from Allah.) (4:108)  This Tafsir was reported from Ibn `Abbas by Ibn Ishaq. It was also said that the Ayah means that when such people announce their Islam, they swear by Allah that what is in their hearts is the same of what their tongues are pronouncing. This is also a correct meaning for the Ayah that was chosen by `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. It is also the choice of Ibn Jarir who related it to Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid. Allah knows best.  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóåõæó ÃóáóÏøõ ÇáúÎöÕóÇãö</div><br>  (Yet he is the most Aladd of the opponents.) (2:204) lThe Ayah used the word Aladd here, which literally means `wicked' (here it means `quarrelsome'). A variation of the word Ludda was also used in another Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊõäúĞöÑó Èöåö ŞóæúãÇğ áøõÏøÇğ</div><br>  (So that you (Muhammad) warn with it (the Qur'an) a Ludda people.) (19:97)  Hence, a hypocrite lies, alters the truth when he quarrels and does not care for the truth. Rather, he deviates from the truth, deceives and becomes most quarrelsome. It is reported in Sahih that Allah's Messenger said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÂíóÉõ ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞö ËóáÇËñ: ÅöĞóÇ ÍóÏøóËó ßóĞóÈó¡ æóÅĞóÇ ÚóÇåóÏó ÛóÏóÑó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÎóÇÕóãó İóÌóÑ»</div><br>  (The signs of a hypocrite are three: Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie. Whenever he promises, he always breaks it (his promise). If you have a dispute with him, he is most quarrelsome.)  Imam Bukhari reported that `A'ishah narrated that the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÃóÈúÛóÖó ÇáÑøöÌóÇáö Åáóì Çááåö ÇáúÃáóÏøõ ÇáúÎóÕöã»</div><br>  (The most hated person to Allah is he who is Aladd and Khasim (meaning most quarrelsome).)  Allah then said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ Êóæóáøóì ÓóÚóì İöì ÇáÇøñÑúÖö áöíõİúÓöÏó İöíåóÇ æóíõåúáößó ÇáúÍóÑúËó æóÇáäøóÓúáó æóÇááøóåõ áÇó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúİóÓóÇÏó </div><br>  (And when he turns away (from you O Muhammad), he struggles in the land to make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle, and Allah likes not mischief.)  This Ayah indicates that such persons are deviant in the tongue, evil in the deeds, their words are fabricated, their belief is wicked and their works are immoral. The Ayah used the (Arabic word) Sa`a (literally, `tries' or `intends'). This word was also used to describe Pharaoh:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÃóÏúÈóÑó íóÓúÚóì - İóÍóÔóÑó İóäóÇÏóì - İóŞóÇáó ÃóäóÇú ÑóÈøõßõãõ ÇáÇøñÚúáóì - İóÃóÎóĞóåõ Çááøóåõ äóßóÇáó ÇáÇøñÎöÑóÉö æóÇáÇøòæúáóì - Åöäøó İöì Ğóáößó áóÚöÈúÑóÉğ áøöãóä íóÎúÔóì </div><br>  (Then he turned his back, Yas`a (striving hard against Allah). Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud saying, `I am your lord, most high.' So Allah, seized him with a punishing example for his last and first transgression. Verily, in this is an instructive admonition for whosoever fears Allah.) (79:22-26)  Sa`a was also used in the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÃóíøõåóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÁóÇãóäõæÇú ÅöĞóÇ äõæÏöìó áöáÕøóáóæÉö ãöä íóæúãö ÇáúÌõãõÚóÉö İóÇÓúÚóæúÇú Åöáóì ĞößúÑö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Salah (prayer) on the day of Friday (Jumu`ah prayer), As`aw come to the remembrance of Allah.) (62:9)  This Ayah means, `(when the call to the Friday prayer is announced) intend and then proceed to attend the Friday prayer.' We should mention that hastening to the mosque is condemed by the Sunnah (as this is another meaning for the word Sa`a):   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅĞóÇ ÃóÊóíúÊõãõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉó İóáóÇ ÊóÃúÊõæåóÇ æóÃóäúÊõãú ÊóÓúÚóæúäó¡ æóÃúÊõæåóÇ æóÚóáóíúßõãõ ÇáÓøóßöíäóÉõ æÇáúæóŞóÇÑ»</div><br>  (When you come to attend the prayer, do not come in a Sa`i (haste). Rather, come to it while walking at ease and in peace (or grace). )  The hypocrite has no motive in this life but to cause mischief and to destroy the crops and the offspring, including what the animals produce and what the people depend on for their livelihood. Mujahid said, "If the hypocrite strives for mischief in the land, Allah prevents the rain from falling and thus the crops and the offspring perish.'' The Ayah continues:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ áÇó íõÍöÈøõ ÇáúİóÓóÇÏó</div><br>  (...and Allah likes not mischief.) that is, Allah does not like those who possess these characteristics, or those who act like this. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Rejecting Advice is Characteristic of the Hypocrites</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ Şöíáó áóåõ ÇÊøóŞö Çááøóåó ÃóÎóĞóÊúåõ ÇáúÚöÒøóÉõ ÈöÇáÅöËúãö</div><br>  (And when it is said to him, "Fear Allah'', he is led by arrogance to (more) crime.)  This Ayah indicates that when the hypocrite, who deviates in his speech and deeds, is advised and commanded to fear Allah, refrain from his evil deeds and adhere to the truth, he refuses and becomes angry and outraged, as he is used to doing evil. This Ayah is similar to what Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ÊõÊúáóì Úóáóíúåöãú ÁóÇíóÜÊõäóÇ ÈóíøöäóÜÊò ÊóÚúÑöİõ İöì æõÌõæåö ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú ÇáúãõäúßóÑó íóßóÜÏõæäó íóÓúØõæäó ÈöÇáøóĞöíäó íóÊúáõæäó Úóáóíúåöãú ÁóÇíóÜÊõäóÇ Şõáú ÃóİóÃõäóÈøöÆõßõã ÈöÔóÑøò ãøöä Ğáößõãõ ÇáäøóÇÑõ æóÚóÏóåóÇ Çááøóåõ ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóÈöÆúÓó ÇáúãóÕöíÑõ </div><br>  (And when Our clear verses are recited to them, you will notice a denial on the faces of the disbelievers! They are nearly ready to attack with violence those who recite Our verses to them. Say: "Shall I tell you of something worse than that The Fire (of Hell) which Allah has promised to those who disbelieved, and worst indeed is that destination!) (22:72)  This is why in this Ayah, Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÍóÓúÈõåõ Ìóåóäøóãõ æóáóÈöÆúÓó ÇáúãöåóÇÏõ</div><br>  (So enough for him is Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest) meaning, the Fire is enough punishment for the hypocrite. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Sincere Believer prefers pleasing Allah</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íóÔúÑöì äóİúÓóåõ ÇÈúÊöÛóÂÁó ãóÑúÖóÇÊö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.)  After Allah described the evil characteristics of the hypocrites, He mentioned the good qualities of the believers. Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íóÔúÑöì äóİúÓóåõ ÇÈúÊöÛóÂÁó ãóÑúÖóÇÊö Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.)  Ibn `Abbas, Anas, Sa`id bin Musayyib, Abu `Uthman An-Nahdi, `Ikrimah and several other scholars said that this Ayah was revealed about Suhayb bin Sinan Ar-Rumi. When Suhayb became a Muslim in Makkah and intended to migrate (to Al-Madinah), the people (Quraysh) prevented him from migrating with his money. They said that if he forfeits his property, he is free to migrate. He abandoned his money and preferred to migrate, and Allah revealed this Ayah about him. `Umar bin Khattab and several other Companions met Suhayb close to the outskirts of Al-Madinah at Al-Harrah (flat lands with black stones). They said to him, "The trade has indeed been successful.'' He answered them, "You too, may Allah never allow your trade to fail. What is the matter'' `Umar told him that Allah has revealed this Ayah (2:207) about him. It was also reported that Allah's Messenger said, "The trade has been successful, O Suhayb!''  The meaning of the Ayah (2:207) includes every Mujahid in the way of Allah. Allah said in another Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÇÔúÊóÑóì ãöäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÃóäİõÓóåõãú æóÃóãúæóáóåõãú ÈöÃóäøó áóåõãõ ÇáøÌóäøóÉó íõŞóÜÊöáõæäó İöì ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö İóíóŞúÊõáõæäó æóíõŞúÊóáõæäó æóÚúÏğÇ Úóáóíúåö ÍóŞøğÇ İöí ÇáÊøóæúÑóÇÉö æóÇáÅöäÌöíáö æóÇáúŞõÑúÁÇäö æóãóäú Ãóæúİóì ÈöÚóåúÏöåö ãöäó Çááøóåö İóÇÓúÊóÈúÔöÑõæÇú ÈöÈóíúÚößõãõ ÇáøóĞöì ÈóÇíóÚúÊõãú Èöåö æóĞóáößó åõæó ÇáúİóæúÒõ ÇáúÚóÙöíãõ </div><br>  (Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for (the price) that theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in Allah's cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Tawrah and the Injil and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success.) (9:111)  When Hisham bin `Amr penetrated the lines of the enemy, some people criticized him. `Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu Hurayrah refuted them and recited this Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãöäó ÇáäøóÇÓö ãóä íóÔúÑöì äóİúÓóåõ ÇÈúÊöÛóÂÁó ãóÑúÖóÇÊö Çááøóåö æóÇááøóåõ ÑóÁõæİñ ÈöÇáúÚöÈóÇÏö </div><br>  (And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.
