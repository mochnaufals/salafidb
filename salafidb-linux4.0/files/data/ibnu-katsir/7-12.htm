(Allah) said: "What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not prostrate, when I commanded you'' Iblis said: "I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You created from clay.'')  Allah said,</div>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ãóÇ ãóäóÚóßó ÃóáÇøó ÊóÓúÌõÏó</div><br>  (What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not prostrate) 7: 12 meaning, what stopped and hindered you from prostrating after I ordered you to do so, according to Ibn Jarir. This meaning is sound, and Allah knows best. Iblis, may Allah curse him, said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóäóÇú ÎóíúÑñ ãøöäúåõ</div><br>  (I am better than him (Adam)), and this excuse is worse than the crime itself! Shaytan said that he did not obey Allah because he who is better cannot prostrate to he who is less. Shaytan, may Allah curse him, meant that he is better than Adam, "So how can You order me to prostrate before him'' Shaytan said that he is better than Adam because he was created from fire while, "You created him from clay, and fire is better.'' The cursed one looked at the origin of creation not at the honor bestowed, that is, Allah creating Adam with His Hand and blowing life into him. Shaytan made a false comparison when confronted by Allah's command,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóŞóÚõæÇú áóåõ ÓóÜÌöÏöíäó</div><br>  ("Then you fall down prostrate to him'')38:72. Therefore, Shaytan alone contradicted the angels, because he refused to prostrate. He, thus, became `Ablasa' from the mercy, meaning, lost hope in acquiring Allah's mercy. He committed this error, may Allah curse him, due to his false comparison. His claim that the fire is more honored than mud was also false, because mud has the qualities of wisdom, for - bearance, patience and assurance, mud is where plants grow, flourish, increase, and provide good. To the contrary, fire has the qualities of burning, recklessness and hastiness. Therefore, the origin of creation directed Shaytan to failure, while the origin of Adam led him to return to Allah with repentance, humbleness, obedience and submission to His command, admitting his error and seeking Allah's forgiveness and pardon for it. Muslim recorded that `Aishah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÎõáöŞóÊö ÇáúãóáóÇÆößóÉõ ãöäú äõæÑò æóÎõáöŞó ÅöÈúáöíÓõ ãöäú ãóÇÑöÌò ãöäú äóÇÑò æóÎõáöŞó ÂÏóãõ ãöãøóÇ æõÕöİó áóßõã»</div><br>  (The angels were created from light, Shaytan from a smokeless flame of fire, while Adam was created from what was described to you). <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Iblis was the First to use Qiyas (Analogical Comparison)</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Hasan commented on Shaytan's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóáóŞúÊóäöì ãöä äøóÇÑò æóÎóáóŞúÊóåõ ãöä Øöíäò</div><br>  ("You created me from fire, and him You created from clay.'') "Iblis used Qiyas analogy, and he was the first one to do so.'' This statement has an authentic chain of narration. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Sirin said, "The first to use Qiyas was Iblis, and would the sun and moon be worshipped if it was not for Qiyas'' This statement also has an authentic chain of narration.  </div></body></html>
