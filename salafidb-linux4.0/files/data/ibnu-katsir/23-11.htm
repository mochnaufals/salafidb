These are the believers who have the following characteristics:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú İöì ÕóáÇóÊöåöãú ÎóÜÔöÚõæäó </div><br>  (Those who with their Salah are Khashi`un.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÜÔöÚõæäó</div><br>  "(Khashi`un) means those with fear and with tranquillity.'' This was also narrated from Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri. It was reported from `Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, that Khushu` means the Khushu` of the heart. This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha`i. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, "Their Khushu` was in their hearts.'' So they lowered their gaze and were humble towards others. Khushu` in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else. At that point it becomes a delight and a joy for eyes, as in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa'i from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÍõÈøöÈó Åöáóíøó ÇáØøöíÈõ æóÇáäøöÓóÇÁõ¡ æóÌõÚöáóÊú ŞõÑøóÉõ Úóíúäöí İöí ÇáÕøóáóÇÉ»</div><br>  (Fragrance and women have been made dear to me, and Salah was made the joy of my eye.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú Úóäö ÇááøóÛúæö ãøõÚúÑöÖõæäó </div><br>  (And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.) refers to falsehood, which includes Shirk and sin, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit. As Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöĞóÇ ãóÑøõæÇú ÈöÇááøóÛúæö ãóÑøõæÇú ßöÑÇãÇğ</div><br>  (And if they pass by Al-Laghw, they pass by it with dignity)25:72. Qatadah said: "By Allah, there came to them from Allah that which kept them away from that (evil).''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú áöáÒøóßóÜæÉö İóÜÚöáõæäó </div><br>  (And those who pay the Zakah.) Most commentators say that the meaning here is the Zakah that is paid on wealth, even though this Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and Zakah was ordained in Al-Madinah in the year 2 H. The apparent meaning is that the Zakah that was instituted in Al-Madinah is the one based upon the Nusub and the specific amounts, apart from which it seems that the basic principle of Zakah was enjoined in Makkah. As Allah says in Surat Al-An`am, which was also revealed in Makkah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇÊõæÇú ÍóŞøóåõ íóæúãó ÍóÕóÇÏöåö</div><br>  (but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest, ) 6:141 It could be that what is meant here by Zakah is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ŞóÏú ÃóİúáóÍó ãóä ÒóßøóÜåóÇ - æóŞóÏú ÎóÇÈó ãóä ÏóÓøóÜåóÇ </div><br>  (Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself (Zakkaha). And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.) 91:9-10 It could be that both meanings are intended, purification of the soul and of one's wealth, because that is part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters. And Allah knows best.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú áöİõÑõæÌöåöãú ÍóÜİöÙõæäó - ÅöáÇøó Úóáóì ÃóÒúæóÌöåöãú Ãóæú ãóÇ ãóáóßóÊú ÃóíúãóÜäõåõãú İóÅöäøóåõãú ÛóíúÑõ ãóáõæãöíäó - İóãóäö ÇÈúÊóÛóì æóÑóÂÁó Ğáößó İóÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúÚóÇÏõæäó </div><br>  (And those who guard their private parts. Except from their wives and their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.) means, those who protect their private parts from unlawful actions and do not do that which Allah has forbidden; fornication and homosexuality, and do not approach anyone except the wives whom Allah has made permissible for them or their right hand possessions from the captives. One who seeks what Allah has made permissible for him is not to be blamed and there is no sin on him. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóÅöäøóåõãú ÛóíúÑõ ãóáõæãöíäóİóãóäö ÇÈúÊóÛóì æóÑóÂÁó Ğáößó</div><br>  (they are free from blame.

This is not like the hypocrites about whom the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÂíóÉõ ÇáúãõäóÇİöŞö ËóáóÇËñ: ÅöĞóÇ ÍóÏøóËó ßóĞóÈó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ æóÚóÏó ÃóÎúáóİó¡ æóÅöĞóÇ ÇÄúÊõãöäó ÎóÇä»</div><br>  (The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.)   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáøóĞöíäó åõãú Úóáóì ÕóáóæóÊöåöãú íõÍóÜİöÙõæäó </div><br>  (And those who strictly guard their Salawat.) means, they persistently offer their prayers at their appointed times, as Ibn Mas`ud said: "I asked the Messenger of Allah , `O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÕøóáóÇÉõ Úóáóì æóŞúÊöåóÇ»</div><br>  (Prayer at the appointed time.) I said, `Then what' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÈöÑøõ ÇáúæóÇáöÏóíúä»</div><br>  (Kindness to one's parents. ) I said, `Then what' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáúÌöåóÇÏõ İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááå»</div><br>  (Jihad in the way of Allah.) It was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Qatadah said: "At the fixed times, with the proper bowing and prostration.'' Allah begins and ends this list of praiseworthy qualities with Salah, which is indicative of its virtue, as the Prophet said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇÓúÊóŞöíãõæÇ æóáóäú ÊõÍúÕõæÇ¡ æóÇÚúáóãõæÇ Ãóäøó ÎóíúÑó ÃóÚúãóÇáößõãõ ÇáÕøóáóÇÉõ¡ æóáóÇ íõÍóÇİöÙõ Úóáóì ÇáúæõÖõæÁö ÅöáøóÇ ãõÄúãöä»</div><br>  (Adhere to righteousness, you will never be able encompass it all. Know that the best of your deeds is Salah. None will preserve his Wuddu' except the believer.) Having described them with these praiseworthy characteristics and righteous deeds, Allah then says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúæóÑöËõæäó - ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÑöËõæäó ÇáúİöÑúÏóæúÓó åõãú İöíåóÇ ÎóÜáöÏõæäó </div><br>  (These are indeed the heirs. Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever.) It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ÓóÃóáúÊõãõ Çááåó ÇáúÌóäøóÉó İóÇÓúÃóáõæåõ ÇáúİöÑúÏóæúÓó¡ İóÅöäøóåõ ÃóÚúáóì ÇáúÌóäøóÉö æóÃóæúÓóØõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóãöäúåõ ÊóİóÌøóÑõ ÃóäúåóÇÑõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóİóæúŞóåõ ÚóÑúÔõ ÇáÑøóÍúãä»</div><br>  (If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the (Mighty) Throne of the Most Merciful.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, "The Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ãöäúßõãú ãöäú ÃóÍóÏò ÅöáøóÇ æóáóåõ ãóäúÒöáóÇäö: ãóäúÒöáñ İöí ÇáúÌóäøóÉö¡ æóãóäúÒöáñ İöí ÇáäøóÇÑö¡ İóÅöäú ãóÇÊó İóÏóÎóáó ÇáäøóÇÑó æóÑöËó Ãóåúáõ ÇáúÌóäøóÉö ãóäúÒöáóåõ¡ İóĞóáößó Şóæúáõåõ:</div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúæóÑöËõæäó </div><br>   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>»</div><br>  (There is not one among you who does not have two homes, a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: (These are indeed the heirs.) Ibn Jurayj narrated from Layth from Mujahid:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó åõãõ ÇáúæóÑöËõæäó </div><br>  (These are indeed the heirs.) "The believers will inherit the homes of the disbelievers because they were created to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate. So when these believers did what was enjoined on them of worship, and the disbelievers neglected to do that which they were commanded to do and for which they had been created, the believers gained the share that they would have been given if they had obeyed their Lord. Indeed, they will be given more than that as well.'' This is what was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Burdah, from his father, from the Prophet who said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«íóÌöíÁõ íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö äóÇÓñ ãöäó ÇáúãõÓúáöãöíäó ÈöĞõäõæÈò ÃóãúËóÇáö ÇáúÌöÈóÇáö¡İóíóÛúİöÑõåóÇ Çááåõ áóåõãú æóíóÖóÚõåóÇ Úóáóì ÇáúíóåõæÏö æóÇáäøóÕóÇÑóì»</div><br>  (Some of the Muslims will come on the Day of Resurrection with sins like mountains, but Allah will forgive them and put (their burden of sin) on the Jews and Christians.) According to another version: the Messenger of Allah said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöĞóÇ ßóÇäó íóæúãõ ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉö ÏóİóÚó Çááåõ áößõáøö ãõÓúáöãò íóåõæÏöíøğÇ Ãóæú äóÕúÑóÇäöíøğÇ¡ İóíõŞóÇáõ: åóĞóÇ İößóÇßõßó ãöäó ÇáäøóÇÑ»</div><br>  (When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will appoint for every Muslim a Jew or Christian, and it will be said, "This is your ransom from the Fire.'') `Umar bin `Abd Al-`Aziz asked Abu Burdah to swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other God, three times, that his father told him that from the Prophet , and he swore that oath. I say: this Ayah is like Allah's saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Êöáúßó ÇáúÌóäøóÉõ ÇáøóÊöì äõæÑöËõ ãöäú ÚöÈóÇÏöäóÇ ãóä ßóÇäó ÊóŞöíøÇğ </div><br>  (Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who have had Taqwa.) 19:63   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÊöáúßó ÇáúÌóäøóÉõ ÇáøóÊöì ÃõæÑöËúÊõãõæåóÇ ÈöãóÇ ßõäÊõãú ÊóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do.) 43:72  </div></body></html>
