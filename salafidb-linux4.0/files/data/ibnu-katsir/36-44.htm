Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÁóÇíóÉñ áøóåõãú ÃóäøóÇ ÍóãóáúäóÇ ĞõÑøöíøóÊóåõãú</div><br>  (And an Ayah for them is that We bore their offspring) means, their forefathers,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İöì Çáúİõáúßö ÇáúãóÔúÍõæäö</div><br>  (in the laden ship.) means, in the ship which was filled with luggage and animals, in which Allah commanded him to put two of every kind. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Laden means filled.'' This was also the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ash-Sha`bi, Qatadah and As-Suddi. Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said, "This was the ship of Nuh peace be upon him.''   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÎóáóŞúäóÇ áóåõãú ãøöä ãøöËúáöåö ãóÇ íóÑúßóÈõæäó </div><br>  (And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.) Al-`Awfi said, narrating from Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, "This means the camel, for it is the ship of the land on which they carry goods and on which they ride. '' Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Do you know what the Ayah:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÎóáóŞúäóÇ áóåõãú ãøöä ãøöËúáöåö ãóÇ íóÑúßóÈõæäó </div><br>  (And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.) refers to'' We said, "No.'' He said, "This refers to the ships which were made after the ship of Nuh, peace be upon him, which was similar to it.'' This was also the view of Abu Malik, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Abu Salih and As-Suddi, that the Ayah   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÎóáóŞúäóÇ áóåõãú ãøöä ãøöËúáöåö ãóÇ íóÑúßóÈõæäó </div><br>  (And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.) refers to ships.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöä äøóÔóÃú äõÛúÑöŞúåõãú</div><br>  (And if We will, We shall drown them,) means, those who are on board the ships.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóáÇó ÕóÑöíÎó áóåõãú</div><br>  (and there will be no shout for them) means, there will be no one to save them from their predicament.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó åõãú íõäŞóĞõæäó</div><br>  (nor will they be saved. ) means, from what has befallen them.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÅöáÇøó ÑóÍúãóÉğ ãøöäøóÇ</div><br>  (Unless it be a mercy from Us,) means, `but by Our mercy We make it easy for you to travel on land and sea, and We keep you safe until an appointed time.' Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóãóÊóÇÚÇğ Åöáóì Íöíäò</div><br>  (and as an enjoyment for a while.) meaning, until a time that is known to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.  </div></body></html>
