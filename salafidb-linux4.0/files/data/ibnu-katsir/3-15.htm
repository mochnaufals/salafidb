Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, Qanatir Al-Muqantarah of gold and silver, branded beautiful horses (Musawwamah), cattle and fertile land.

Say: "Shall I inform you of things far better than those For those who have Taqwa there are Gardens (Paradise) with their Lord, underneath which rivers flow. Therein (is their) eternal (home) and Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives). And Allah will be pleased with them. And Allah is All-Seer of the servants.'')</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The True Value of This Earthly Life</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah mentions the delights that He put in this life for people, such as women and children, and He started with women, because the test with them is more tempting. For instance, the Sahih recorded that the Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÊóÑóßúÊõ ÈóÚúÏöí İöÊúäóÉğ ÃóÖóÑøó Úóáóì ÇáÑøöÌóÇáö ãöäó ÇáäøöÓóÇÁ»</div><br>  (I did not leave behind me a test more tempting to men than women.)  When one enjoys women for the purpose of having children and preserving his chastity, then he is encouraged to do so. There are many Hadiths that encourage getting married, such as,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÅöäøó ÎóíúÑó åĞöåö ÇáúÃõãøóÉö ãóäú ßóÇäó ÃóßúËóÑóåóÇ äöÓóÇÁ»</div><br>  (Verily, the best members of this Ummah are those who have the most wives) He also said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ ãóÊóÇÚñ¡ æóÎóíúÑõ ãóÊóÇÚöåóÇ ÇáúãóÑúÃóÉõ ÇáÕøóÇáöÍóÉ»</div><br>  (This life is a delight, and the best of its delight is a righteous wife)  The Prophet said in another Hadith,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÍõÈøöÈó Åöáóíøó ÇáäøöÓóÇÁõ æóÇáØøöíÈõ¡ æóÌõÚöáóÊú ŞõÑøóÉõ Úóíúäöí İöí ÇáÕøóáóÇÉ»</div><br>  (I was made to like women and perfume, and the comfort of my eye is the prayer.)  `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, "Nothing was more beloved to the Messenger of Allah than women, except horses,'' and in another narration, "...than horses except women.''  The desire to have children is sometimes for the purpose of pride and boasting, and as such, is a temptation. When the purpose for having children is to reproduce and increase the Ummah of Muhammad with those who worship Allah alone without partners, then it is encouraged and praised. A Hadith states,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÊóÒóæøóÌõæÇ ÇáúæóÏõæÏó ÇáúæóáõæÏó¡ İóÅöäøöí ãõßóÇËöÑñ Èößõãõ ÇáúÃõãóãó íóæúãó ÇáúŞöíóÇãóÉ»</div><br>  (Marry the Wadud (kind) and Walud (fertile) woman, for I will compare your numbers to the rest of the nations on the Day of Resurrection.)  The desire of wealth sometimes results out of arrogance, and the desire to dominate the weak and control the poor, and this conduct is prohibited. Sometimes, the want for more money is for the purpose of spending it on acts of worship, being kind to the family, the relatives, and spending on various acts of righteousness and obedience; this behavior is praised and encouraged in the religion.  Scholars of Tafsir have conflicting opinions about the amount of the Qintar, all of which indicate that the Qintar is a large amount of money, as Ad-Dahhak and other scholars said. Abu Hurayrah said "The Qintar is twelve thousand Uwqiyah, each Uwqiyah is better than what is between the heavens and earth.'' This was recorded by Ibn Jarir .  The desire to have horses can be one of three types. Sometimes, owners of horses collect them to be used in the cause of Allah, and when warranted, they use their horses in battle. This type of owner shall be rewarded for this good action. Another type collects horses to boast, and out of enmity to the people of Islam, and this type earns a burden for his behavior. Another type collects horses to fulfill their needs and to collect their offspring, and they do not forget Allah's right due on their horses. This is why in this case, these horses provide a shield of sufficiency for their owner, as evident by a Hadith that we will mention, Allah willing, when we explain Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÚöÏøõæÇú áóåõãú ãøóÇ ÇÓúÊóØóÚúÊõã ãøä ŞõæøóÉò æóãöä ÑøÈóÇØö ÇáúÎóíúáö</div><br>  (And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war.) 8:60.  As for the Musawwamah horses, Ibn `Abbas said that they are the branded, beautiful horses. This is the same explanation of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Abdullah bin Abza, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Abu Sinan and others. Makhul said the Musawwamah refers to the horse with a white spotted faced, and the horse with white feet. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóíúÓó ãöäú İóÑóÓò ÚóÑóÈöíó ÅöáøóÇ íõÄúĞóäõ áóåõ ãóÚó ßõáøö İóÌúÑò íóÏúÚõæ ÈöÏóÚúæóÊóíúäö íóŞõæáõ: Çááøóåõãøó Åöäøóßó ÎóæøóáúÊóäöí ãöäú Èóäöí ÂÏóãó¡ İóÇÌúÚóáúäöí ãöäú ÃóÍóÈøö ãóÇáöåö æóÃóåúáöåö Åöáóíúåö Ãóæú ÃóÍóÈøó Ãóåúáöåö æóãóÇáöåö Åöáóíúå»</div><br>  (Every Arabian horse is allowed to have two supplications every dawn, and the horse supplicates, `O Allah! You made me subservient to the son of Adam. Therefore, make me among the dearest of his wealth and household to him, or, ...make me the dearest of his household and wealth to him.)  Allah's statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáÇøñäúÚóÜãõ</div><br>  (Cattle) means, camels, cows and sheep.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇáúÍóÑúËö</div><br>  (And fertile land) meaning, the land that is used to farm and grow plants.  Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ğóáößó ãóÊóÜÚõ ÇáúÍóíóæÉö ÇáÏøõäúíóÇ</div><br>  (This is the pleasure of the present world's life) Ymeaning, these are the delights of this life and its short lived joys,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÚöäÏóåõ ÍõÓúäõ ÇáúãóÃóÈö</div><br>  (But Allah has the excellent return with Him) meaning, the best destination and reward. <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Reward of the Those Who Have Taqwa is Better Than All Joys of This World</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Şõáú ÃóÄõäóÈøöÆõßõãú ÈöÎóíúÑò ãøöä Ğóáößõãú</div><br>  (Say: "Shall I inform you of things far better than those'')  This Ayah means, "Say, O Muhammad, to the people, `Should I tell you about what is better than the delights and joys of this life that will soon perish''' Allah informed them of what is better when He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áöáøóĞöíäó ÇÊøóŞóæúÇú ÚöäÏó ÑóÈøöåöãú ÌóäøóÜÊñ ÊóÌúÑöì ãöä ÊóÍúÊöåóÇ ÇáÇøñäúåóÇÑõ</div><br>  (For those who have Taqwa there are Gardens (Paradise) with their Lord, underneath which rivers flow) meaning, rivers run throughout it. These rivers carry various types of drinks: honey, milk, wine and water such that no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever imagined,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÎóÜáöÏöíäó İöíåóÂ</div><br>  (Therein (is their) eternal (home)) meaning, they shall remain in it forever and ever and will not want to be removed from it.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÃóÒúæóÌñ ãøõØóåøóÑóÉñ</div><br>  (And Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives)) meaning, from filth, dirt, harm, menstruation, post birth bleeding, and other things that affect women in this world.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÑöÖúæóäñ ãøöäó Çááøóåö</div><br>  (And Allah will be pleased with them) meaning, Allah's pleasure will descend on them and He shall never be angry with them after that.

Allah then said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇááøóåõ ÈóÕöíÑñ ÈöÇáúÚöÈóÇÏö</div><br>  (And Allah is All-Seer of the (His) servants) and, He gives each provisions according to what they deserve.  </div></body></html>
