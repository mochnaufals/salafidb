Their response was only to say:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÆöä áøóãú ÊóäÊóåö íáõæØõ</div><br>  (If you cease not, O Lut,) meaning, `if you do not give up what you have brought,'   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>áóÊóßõæäóäøó ãöäó ÇáúãõÎúÑóÌöíäó</div><br>  (verily, you will be one of those who are driven out!) meaning, `we will expel you from among us.' This is like the Ayah,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóãóÇ ßóÇäó ÌóæóÇÈó Şóæúãöåö ÅöáÇøó Ãóä ŞóÇáõæÇú ÃóÎúÑöÌõæÇú ÁóÇáó áõæØò ãøöä ŞóÑúíóÊößõãú Åöäøóåãú ÃõäóÇÓñ íóÊóØóåøóÑõæäó </div><br>  (There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: "Drive out the family of Lut from your city. Verily, these are men who want to be clean and pure!'') (27:56). When he saw that they would not give up their ways, and that they were persisting in their misguidance, he declared his innocence of them, saying:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøöì áöÚóãóáößõãú ãøöäó ÇáúŞóÜáöíäó</div><br>  (I am, indeed, of those who disapprove with severe anger and fury) `Of those who are outraged, I do not like it and I do not accept it, and I have nothing to do with you. ' Then he prayed to Allah against them and said:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÑóÈøö äøóÌöäöì æóÃóåúáöì ãöãøóÇ íóÚúãóáõæäó </div><br>  (My Lord! Save me and my family from what they do.) Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>İóäóÌøóíúäóÜåõ æóÃóåúáóåõ ÃóÌúãóÚöíäó - ÅöáÇøó ÚóÌõæÒÇğ İöì ÇáúÛóÜÈöÑöíäó </div><br>  (So, We saved him and his family, all. Except an old woman among those who remained behind.) This was his wife, who was a bad old woman. She stayed behind and was destroyed with whoever else was left. This is similar to what Allah says about them in Surat Al-A`raf and Surah Hud, and in Surat Al-Hijr, where Allah commanded him to take his family at night, except for his wife, and not to turn around when they heard the Sayhah as it came upon his people. So they patiently obeyed the command of Allah and persevered, and Allah sent upon the people a punishment which struck them all, and rained upon them stones of baked clay, piled up. Allah says:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ëõãøó ÏóãøóÑúäóÇ ÇáÇøñÎóÑöíäó æóÃóãúØóÑúäóÇ Úóáóíúåöãú ãøóØóÑğÇ</div><br>  (Then afterward We destroyed the others.
