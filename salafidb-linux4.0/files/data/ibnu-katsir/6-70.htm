And leave alone those who take their religion as play and amusement, and are deceived by the life of this world.

Such are they who are given up to destruction because of that which they have earned. For them will be a drink of boiling water and a painful torment because they used to disbelieve.)

The Ayah commands to leave such people, ignore them and give them respite, for soon, they will taste a tremendous torment. This is why Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóĞóßøöÑú Èöåö</div><br>  (But remind with it) meaning, remind the people with this Qur'an and warn them against Allah's revenge and painful torment on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Ãóä ÊõÈúÓóáó äóİúÓñ ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈóÊú</div><br>  (lest a soul Tubsal for that which one has earned,) meaning, so that it is not Tubsal. Ad-Dahhak from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi said that Tubsal means, be submissive. Al-Walibi said that Ibn `Abbas said that Tubsal means, `be exposed'. Qatadah said that Tubsal means, `be prevented', Murrah and Ibn Zayd said that it means, `be recompensed', Al-Kalbi said, `be reckoned'. All these statements and expressions are similar, for they all mean exposure to destruction, being kept away from all that is good, and being restrained from attaining what is desired. Allah also said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ßõáøõ äóİúÓò ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈóÊú ÑóåöíäóÉñ - ÅöáÇøó ÃóÕúÍóÜÈó Çáúíóãöíäö </div><br>  (Every person is restrained by what he has earned.

Allah said in a similar statement,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó ÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇú æóãóÇÊõæÇú æóåõãú ßõİøóÇÑñ İóáóä íõŞúÈóáó ãöäú ÃóÍóÏöåöã ãøöáúÁõ ÇáÇøñÑúÖö ĞóåóÈğÇ</div><br>  (Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them.) 3:91 Allah said here,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃõæúáóÜÆößó ÇáøóĞöíäó ÃõÈúÓöáõæÇú ÈöãóÇ ßóÓóÈõæÇú áóåõãú ÔóÑóÇÈñ ãøöäú Íóãöíãò æóÚóĞóÇÈñ Ãóáöíãñ ÈöãóÇ ßóÇäõæÇú íóßúİõÑõæäó</div><br>  (Such are they who are given up to destruction because of that which they have earned.
