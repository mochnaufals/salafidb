O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicion is sin. And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother You would hate it.

Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful.)</div> <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>The Prohibition of Unfounded Suspicion</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted forbids His faithful servants from being suspicious, which includes having doubts and suspicions about the conduct of one's family, relatives and other people in general. Therefore, Muslims are to avoid suspicion without foundation. The Leader of the faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "Never think ill of the word that comes out of your believing brother's mouth, as long as you can find a good excuse for it.'' Malik recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that Allah's Messenger said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÅöíøóÇßõãú æóÇáÙøóäøó İóÅöäøó ÇáÙøóäøó ÃóßúĞóÈõ ÇáúÍóÏöíËö¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÌóÓøóÓõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÍóÓøóÓõæÇ¡ æóáóÇ ÊóäóÇİóÓõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÍóÇÓóÏõæÇ¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÈóÇÛóÖõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÏóÇÈóÑõæÇ¡ æóßõæäõæÇ ÚöÈóÇÏó Çááåö ÅöÎúæóÇäğÇ»</div><br>  (Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst of false tales; do not spy on one another; do not look for other's faults; do not be jealous of one another; do not envy one another; do not hate one another; and do not desert (shun) one another. And O Allah's servants! Be brothers!) The Two Sahihs and Abu Dawud recorded this Hadith. Anas said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóŞóÇØóÚõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÏóÇÈóÑõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÈóÇÛóÖõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÍóÇÓóÏõæÇ¡ æóßõæäõæÇ ÚöÈóÇÏó Çááåö ÅöÎúæóÇäğÇ¡ æóáóÇ íóÍöáøõ áöãõÓúáöãò Ãóäú íóåúÌõÑó ÃóÎóÇåõ İóæúŞó ËóáóÇËóÉö ÃóíøóÇã»</div><br>  (Do not shun each other; do not ignore one another; do not hate one another, and do not envy one another, and be brothers, O servants of Allah. No Muslim is allowed to shun his brother for more than three days.) Muslim and At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith, who considered it Sahih. Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó ÊóÌóÓøóÓõæÇú</div><br>  (And spy not), on each other. Tajassus, usually harbors ill intentions, and the spy is called a Jasus. As for Tahassus (inquiring) it is usually done for a good reason. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said that Prophet Ya`qub said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>íÈóäöìøó ÇĞúåóÈõæÇú İóÊóÍóÓøóÓõæÇú ãöä íõæÓõİó æóÃóÎöíåö æóáÇó ÊóÇíúÜóÓõæÇú ãöä ÑøóæúÍö Çááøóåö</div><br>  ("O my sons! Go you and inquire (Tahassasu) about Yusuf and his brother, and never give up hope of Allah's mercy.'') (12:87) Both of these terms, `Tajassus' and `Tahassus' could have evil connotations. In the Sahih it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóÇ ÊóÌóÓøóÓõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÍóÓøóÓõæÇ¡ æóáóÇ ÊóÈóÇÛóÖõæÇ æóáóÇ ÊóÏóÇÈóÑõæÇ¡ æóßõæäõæÇ ÚöÈóÇÏó Çááåö ÅöÎúæóÇäğÇ»</div><br>  (Neither commit Tajassus nor Tahassus nor hate each other nor commit Tadabur. And be brothers, O servants of Allah.) Al-Awza`i said, "Tajassus means, to search for something, while Tahassus means, listening to people when they are talking without their permission, or eavesdropping at their doors. Tadabur refers to shunning each other. '' Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement. Allah the Exalted said about backbiting;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóáÇó íóÛúÊóÈ ÈøóÚúÖõßõã ÈóÚúÖÇğ</div><br>  (neither backbite one another), thus prohibiting it, which was explained in a Hadith collected by Abu Dawud that Abu Hurayrah said, "It was asked, `O Allah's Messenger! What is backbiting' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ĞößúÑõßó ÃóÎóÇßó ÈöãóÇ íóßúÑóå»</div><br>  (Mentioning about your brother in a manner that he dislikes.) He was asked, `What if my brother was as I mentioned' He said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäú ßóÇäó İöíåö ãóÇ ÊóŞõæáõ İóŞóÏö ÇÛúÊóÈúÊóåõ¡ æóÅöäú áóãú íóßõäú İöíåö ãóÇ ÊóŞõæáõ İóŞóÏú ÈóåóÊøóå»</div><br>  (If he was as you mentioned, you will have committed backbiting. But if he was not as you say about him, you will have falsely accused him.)'' At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said "Hasan Sahih.'' Backbiting was sternly warned against, and this is why Allah the Exalted and Most Blessed compared it to eating the flesh of a dead human being,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>ÃóíõÍöÈøõ ÃóÍóÏõßõãú Ãóä íóÃúßõáó áóÍúãó ÃóÎöíåö ãóíúÊÇğ İóßóÑöåúÊõãõæåõ</div><br>  (Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother You would hate it.) Just as you hate eating the flesh of a dead person, on account of your nature; so hate backbiting, on account of your religion. The latter carries a punishment that is worse than the former. This Ayah seeks to discourage people from backbiting and warns against it. The Prophet used these words to discourage taking back a gift that one gives to someone,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßóÇáúßóáúÈö íóŞöíÁõ Ëõãøó íóÑúÌöÚõ İöí ŞóíúÆöå»</div><br>  (He is just like the dog that eats its vomit.) after saying,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«áóíúÓó áóäóÇ ãóËóáõ ÇáÓøóæúÁ»</div><br>  (Ours is not an evil parable.) Using various chains of narration, the Sahihs and Musnads record that the Prophet said during the Farewell Hajj:   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Åöäøó ÏöãóÇÁóßõãú æóÃóãúæóÇáóßõãú æóÃóÚúÑóÇÖóßõãú Úóáóíúßõãú ÍóÑóÇãñ ßóÍõÑúãóÉö íóæúãößõãú åĞóÇ¡ İöí ÔóåúÑößõãú åĞóÇ¡ İöí ÈóáóÏößõãú åĞóÇ»</div><br>  (Verily, your blood, wealth and honor are as sacred among you as the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours.) Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ßõáøõ ÇáúãõÓúáöãö Úóáóì ÇáúãõÓúáöãö ÍóÑóÇãñ ãóÇáõåõ æóÚöÑúÖõåõ æóÏóãõåõ¡ ÍóÓúÈõ ÇãúÑöìÁò ãöäó ÇáÔøóÑøö Ãóäú íóÍúŞöÑó ÃóÎóÇåõ ÇáúãõÓúáöã»</div><br>  (All of the Muslim is sacred to the Muslim, his wealth, honor and his blood. It is evil enough for someone to belittle his Muslim brother.) At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said "Hasan Gharib.'' Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la recorded that a cousin of Abu Hurayrah said, "Ma`iz came to the Messenger of Allah and said, `O Allah's Messenger! I have committed adultery,' and the Messenger turned away from him until Ma`iz repeated his statement four times. The fifth time, the Prophet asked him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÒóäóíúÊó¿»</div><br>  (Have you committed adultery¿) Ma0 iz said, Yes. The Prophet asked,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«æóÊóÏúÑöí ãóÇ ÇáÒøöäóÇ¿»</div><br>  (Do you know what adultery means) Ma`iz said, `Yes. I have illegally done with her what a husband legally does with his wife.' The Prophet said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ãóÇ ÊõÑöíÏõ Åöáóì åĞóÇ ÇáúŞóæúáö¿»</div><br>  (What do you seek to accomplish by this statement) Ma`iz said, `I intend that you purify me.' The Prophet asked,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÏúÎóáúÊó Ğáößó ãöäúßó İöí Ğáößó ãöäúåóÇ ßóãóÇ íóÛöíÈõ Çáúãöíáõ İöí ÇáúãõßúÍõáóÉö æóÇáÑøöÔóÇ İöí ÇáúÈöÆúÑö¿»</div><br>  (Have you gone into her just as the stick goes into the kohl container and the rope goes into the well) Ma`iz said, `Yes, O Allah's Messenger!' The Prophet commanded that Ma`iz be stoned to death and his order was carried out. The Prophet heard two men saying to one another, `Have you not seen the man who had Allah cover his secret, but his heart could not let him rest until he was stoned to death, just as the dog is stoned' The Prophet continued on and when he passed by the corpse of a donkey, he asked,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«Ãóíúäó İõáóÇäñ æóİõáóÇäñ¿ ÇäúÒöáóÇ İóßõáóÇ ãöäú ÌöíİóÉö åĞóÇ ÇáúÍöãóÇÑ»</div><br>  (Where are so-and-so Dismount and eat from this donkey.) They said, `May Allah forgive you, O Allah's Messenger! Would anyone eat this meat' The Prophet said;   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«İóãóÇ äöáúÊõãóÇ ãöäú ÃóÎöíßõãóÇ ÂäöİğÇ ÃóÔóÏøõ ÃóßúáğÇ ãöäúåõ¡ æóÇáøóĞöí äóİúÓöí ÈöíóÏöåö Åöäøóåõ ÇáúÇäó áóİöí ÃóäúåóÇÑö ÇáúÌóäøóÉö íóäúÛóãöÓõ İöíåóÇ»</div><br>  (The backbiting you committed against your brother is worse as a meal than this meal. By He in Whose Hand is my soul! He is now swimming in the rivers of Paradise.)'' This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, "We were with the Messenger of Allah when a rotten odor was carried by the wind. The Messenger of Allah said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>«ÃóÊóÏúÑõæäó ãóÇ åĞöåö ÇáÑøöíÍõ¿ åóĞöåö ÑöíÍõ ÇáøóĞöíäó íóÛúÊóÇÈõæäó ÇáäøóÇÓ»</div><br>  (Do you know what this odor is It is the odor of those who backbite people.)'' <br>  		 			 								  			 		 			  						 		 <br><h2>Accepted Repentance from Backbiting and Slander</h2> 				 			 								  			 		 					  <br>								  Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÇÊøóŞõæÇú Çááøóåó</div><br>  (And have Taqwa of Allah), that is, regarding what He has commanded you and forbidden for you. Fear Him and beware of Him,   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>Åöäøó Çááøóåó ÊóæøóÇÈñ ÑøóÍöíãñ</div><br>  (Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful.) He forgives those who repent to Him, is merciful with those who go back to Him and trust in Him. The majority of scholars have stated that repentance for committing the sin of backbiting is that one refrains from backbiting intending not to repeat it again. There is a difference of opinion if whether feeling remorse is required in this case, and also if one should apologize to those who he has backbitten. Some scholars stated that it is not necessary for one to ask those whom he has backbitten to forgive him, because if they knew what was said about them, they could be hurt more than if they were not told about it. It is better, they said, that one should praise those whom he has backbitten in audiences in which he has committed the act. It is also better if one defends the injured party against any further backbiting, as much as one can, as recompense for his earlier backbiting.  </div></body></html>
