As they used to admit that no one in heaven or on earth except Allah gave them provision, i.e., by sending down water and causing crops to grow, so they should also realize that there is no god worthy of worship besides Him.   <div id="arabicdesc" dir=rtl><br>æóÅöäøóÂ Ãóæú ÅöíøóÇßõãú áóÚóáóì åõÏğì Ãóæú İöì ÖóáóÜáò ãøõÈöíäò</div><br>  (And verily, (either) we or you are rightly guided or in plain error.) `One of the two sides must be speaking falsehood, and one must be telling the truth.

This indicates disowning them, saying, `you do not belong to us and we do not belong to you, because we call people to Allah, to believe that He is the Only God and to worship Him alone.
